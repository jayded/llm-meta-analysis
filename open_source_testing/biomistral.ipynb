Use of a drainage method to protect the suture line from leakage is a matter of controversy.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives:</title><p>We have compared the surgical outcome of Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty for UPJO repair, with or without internal stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>Eighty-two patients with UPJO were evaluated from 1996 to 2002. Complicated or emergent cases were excluded. Classic standard dismembered pyeloplasty was performed. Internal drainage, with a double j catheter, was performed in several patients, randomly. Another drain was also placed in the retroperitoneal space. The follow-up of patients was planned weekly, with patient visits and urine analysis and intravenous pyelography (IVP) and diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) scan after one month.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study group consisted of 51 male and 31 female patients, who were mostly in the age range of 20 - 40 years. Comparing the two techniques of pyeloplasty with or without internal drainage, there was no significant difference between groups regarding extravasation and anastomosis complications, such as leakage, stenosis, urinoma formation or evidence of obstruction on postoperative IVP or DTPA scan. However, a higher incidence of catheter related urinary symptoms and flank pain was reported among those with internal stent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pyeloplasty, with adequate spatulation, hemostasis and a watertight anastomosis, represents the mainstay of successful pyeloplasty and there may be no significant benefit for urethral stenting, especially in non-complicated cases.</p></sec></abstract><sec id=\"sec92058\"><title>4. Results</title><p>Double stenting was used in 30 cases and pyeloplasty without internal drainage was performed in 52 patients. Both groups were similar in age and sex distribution. The most common symptom was severe flank pain, which was present in 69% of patients. History of urinary tract infection was detected in 47% and 51% reported associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Pyuria was seen in 58% and only 36% of patients had positive urine culture, with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) as the most common pathogen (60%). The preoperative sonographic evaluation and IVP results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl23577\">Table 1</xref>. Intraoperative assessments showed ureteropelvic junction segmental atresia in 45 cases and aberrant vessels in 25 patients. The postoperative course was compared in two groups of patients, with and without internal drainage (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl23578\">Table 2</xref>). Among patients with extravasation in DTPA scan in the stent free group, retrograde DJ stent was inserted in four cases that had unacceptable drainage due to inflammation. One patient had distal ureter obstruction because of distal ureter stone, that was treated by Trans-ureteral lithotripsy (TULP) and stent support. Three other cases had no anatomical abnormality, and they were followed and extravasation resolved spontaneously at control IVP after one month.

    "    <abstract><sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty is the gold standard therapeutic approach to ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). Use of a drainage method to protect the suture line from leakage is a matter of controversy.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives:</title><p>We have compared the surgical outcome of Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty for UPJO repair, with or without internal stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>Eighty-two patients with UPJO were evaluated from 1996 to 2002. Complicated or emergent cases were excluded. Classic standard dismembered pyeloplasty was performed. Internal drainage, with a double j catheter, was performed in several patients, randomly. Another drain was also placed in the retroperitoneal space. The follow-up of patients was planned weekly, with patient visits and urine analysis and intravenous pyelography (IVP) and diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) scan after one month.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study group consisted of 51 male and 31 female patients, who were mostly in the age range of 20 - 40 years. Comparing the two techniques of pyeloplasty with or without internal drainage, there was no significant difference between groups regarding extravasation and anastomosis complications, such as leakage, stenosis, urinoma formation or evidence of obstruction on postoperative IVP or DTPA scan. However, a higher incidence of catheter related urinary symptoms and flank pain was reported among those with internal stent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pyeloplasty, with adequate spatulation, hemostasis and a watertight anastomosis, represents the mainstay of successful pyeloplasty and there may be no significant benefit for urethral stenting, especially in non-complicated cases.</p></sec></abstract><sec id=\"sec92058\"><title>4. Results</title><p>Double stenting was used in 30 cases and pyeloplasty without internal drainage was performed in 52 patients. Both groups were similar in age and sex distribution. The most common symptom was severe flank pain, which was present in 69% of patients. History of urinary tract infection was detected in 47% and 51% reported associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Pyuria was seen in 58% and only 36% of patients had positive urine culture, with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) as the most common pathogen (60%). The preoperative sonographic evaluation and IVP results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl23577\">Table 1</xref>. Intraoperative assessments showed ureteropelvic junction segmental atresia in 45 cases and aberrant vessels in 25 patients. The postoperative course was compared in two groups of patients, with and without internal drainage (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl23578\">Table 2</xref>). Among patients with extravasation in DTPA scan in the stent free group, retrograde DJ stent was inserted in four cases that had unacceptable drainage due to inflammation. One patient had distal ureter obstruction because of distal ureter stone, that was treated by Trans-ureteral lithotripsy (TULP) and stent support. Three other cases had no anatomical abnormality, and they were followed and extravasation resolved spontaneously at control IVP after one month. Removal of DJ stent was planned in one month after operation. However, eight cases missed the time and late stent removal was accompanied with several complications, such as stone formation on the tip of catheter in the bladder of a patient that needed TULP before stent removal.</p><table-wrap id=\"tbl23577\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Results of Preoperative Ultrasonography and Intravenous Pyelography Evaluation <sup><xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"fn21576\">a</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"fn21577\">b</xref></sup></title></caption><table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Imaging Method</th><th rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Right Kidney</th><th rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Left Kidney</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><bold>Sonography</bold></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" /><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td style=\"padding-left: 20pt;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Severe hydronephrosis</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">28 (34.6)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">35 (43.2)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding-left: 20pt;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Moderate hydronephrosis</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8 (9.9)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9 (11.1)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding-left: 20pt;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mild hydronephrosis</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (7.4)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (3.7)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding-left: 20pt;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Without hydronephrosis</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">39 (48)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">34 (42)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><bold>IVP</bold></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" /><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td style=\"padding-left: 20pt;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No secretion</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (7.3)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9 (11)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding-left: 20pt;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Delayed secretion</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33 (40.2)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">38 (46.3)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding-left: 20pt;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Normal secretion</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">43 (52.4)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">35 (42.7)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id=\"fn21576\"><p><sup>a</sup>Abbreviation: IVP, intravenous pyelography</p></fn><fn id=\"fn21577\"><p><sup>b</sup>Data are presented as No. (%).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id=\"tbl23578\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparing Postoperative Course Between Patients who Underwent Pyeloplasty With or Without Internal Drainage <sup><xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"fn21578\">a</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"fn21579\">b</xref></sup></title></caption><table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Post-Operative Course</th><th rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">With Stent (n = 30)</th><th rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Without Stent (n = 52)</th><th rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><bold>Drain removal</bold></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" /><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" /><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td style=\"padding-left: 20pt;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">In 48 hours</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12 (40)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17 (32.7)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.583</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding-left: 20pt;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">After 2 days</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18 (60)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">34 (65.4)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.632</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><bold>Mean hospital stay, d</bold></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">36 &#x000b1;

Thirty patients with acute diarrhea were fed twice-daily 15 ml/kg of Apple Juice (AJ), 30 received White Grape Juice (WGJ), and 30 were given colored and flavored water (WA) as part of their age appropriate dietary intake. The duration and severity of diarrhea were the main endpoint variables of the study performed in a metabolic unit. The patients were similar among the 3 groups, had diarrhea for 50&#x02013;64 hours prior to admission, and were dehydrated when admitted to the unit for study. Half of the patients in each group were well nourished and the others had mild to moderate degrees of malnutrition. Rotavirus infection was the agent causing the illness in 63% of the patients. The infants fed juice ingested 14&#x02013;17% more calories than those given WA, (those receiving AJ and WGJ ingested 95 and 98 Calories/Kg/d respectively) whereas those receiving WA consumed 81 cal/kg/d). The increased energy intake was not at the expense of other foods or milk formula. The mean body weight gain was greater among patients receiving WGJ (+ 50.7 gm) as compared with the patients in the AJ group (+ 18.3 gm) or the patients fed WA (- 0.7 gm) (p = 0.08). The duration of the illness was longer in the infants fed juice as compared with those given WA (p = 0.006), the mean +/- SD duration in hours was 49.4 &#x000b1; 32.6, 47.5 &#x000b1; 38.9 and 26.5 &#x000b1; 27.4 in patients fed AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. All patients improved while ingesting juice and none of them developed persistent diarrhea; most recovered within 50 hours of the beginning of treatment and less than one fourth had diarrhea longer than 96 hours in the unit. The fecal losses were also increased among the juice fed patients (p = 0.001); the mean &#x000b1; SD fecal excretion in g/kg/h was 3.94 &#x000b1; 2.35, 3.59 &#x000b1; 2.35, and 2.19 &#x000b1; 1.63 in AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. The stool output was highest during the first day of treatment among all the patients, though those fed AJ had the highest volume of fecal losses and those who received WA had the lowest stool excretion. After the first day of treatment the differences in fecal excretion were not significant. The ability to tolerate carbohydrates during the illness and immediately after recovery was similar among the 3 groups of patients. Intake of juices with different fructose/glucose ratios and osmolarities resulted in more fecal losses and more prolonged diarrhea as compared with water feedings, but the patients given juice ingested more calories and gained more weight, particularly among those being fed the juice with equimolar concentrations of fructose and glucose.</p></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>The clinical characteristics and the laboratory data of the patients on admission are shown in tables <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>.
