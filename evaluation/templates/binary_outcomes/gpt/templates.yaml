      You are an expert on medical randomized controlled trials. Based on the given trial article, produce a 2x2 contingency table in YAML format for the following Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome. If any of the numerical information is unavailable or not extractable or not easy to calculate, please say "x". Only produce YAML response. Do not provide explanation.
      The YAML format should include the fields "events" and "group_size" for only "intervention" and "comparator" but not "outcome". Example: 
      intervention:
          events: NUMBER
          group_size: NUMBER	
      comparator:
          events: NUMBER
          group_size: NUMBER

      Intervention: {{intervention}}
      Comparator: {{comparator}}
      Outcome: {{outcome}}
