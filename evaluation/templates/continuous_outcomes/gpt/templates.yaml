      Based on the given trial article, what is the table of mean outcome and standard deviation in YAML format for the following Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome?
      Intervention: {{intervention}}
      Comparator: {{comparator}}
      Outcome: {{outcome}}
      
      Include the total size of each group for Intervention and Comparator. 
      The YAML format should include the fields "mean", "standard_deviation", and "group_size" for only "intervention" and "comparator" but not "outcome". Example:
      intervention:
          mean: NUMBER
          standard_deviation: NUMBER
          group_size: NUMBER
      comparator:
          mean: NUMBER
          standard_deviation: NUMBER
          group_size: NUMBER

      Only produce YAML response. Do NOT provide an explanation. If any of the numerical information is unavailable or not extractable or not easy to calculate, please say "x".
      If there are numerical data for pre and post-intervention, choose the post-intervention data. If there are multiple timeframes for the outcome, choose the one closest to the outcome timepoint of interest or the very last one.
