<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir–ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with <ext-link>ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link>NCT04257656</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87–1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95–2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Emergency Project of COVID-19, National Key Research and Development Program of China, the Beijing Science and Technology Project.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 255 patients were screened, of whom 237 were eligible (<xref>figure 1</xref> ). 158 patients were assigned to receive remdesivir and 79 to receive placebo; one patient in the placebo group withdrew their previously written informed consent after randomisation, so 158 and 78 patients were included in the ITT population. No patients were enrolled after March 12, because of the control of the outbreak in Wuhan and on the basis of the termination criteria specified in the protocol, the data safety and monitoring board recommended that the study be terminated and data analysed on March 29. At this stage, the interim analysis was abandoned. When all the other assumptions stayed the same, with the actual enrolment of 236 participants, the statistical power was reduced from 80% to 58%.<fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig></p><p>Three patients in the remdesivir group did not start their assigned treatment so were not included in safety analyses (<xref>figure 1</xref>). The median age of study patients was 65 years (IQR 56–71); sex distribution was 89 (56%) men versus 69 (44%) women in the remdesivir group and 51 (65%) versus 27 (35%) in the placebo group (<xref>table 1</xref> ). The most common comorbidity was hypertension, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease. Lopinavir–ritonavir was co-administered in 42 (18%) patients at baseline. Most patients were in category 3 of the six-point ordinal scale of clinical status at baseline. Some imbalances existed at enrolment between the groups, including more patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease in the remdesivir group than the placebo group. More patients in the control group than in the remdesivir group had been symptomatic for 10 days or less at the time of starting remdesivir or placebo treatment, and a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients had a respiratory rate of more than 24 breaths per min. No other major differences in symptoms, signs, laboratory results, disease severity, or treatments were observed between groups at baseline.<table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline patient characteristics</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th><bold>Remdesivir group (n=158)</bold></th><th><bold>Placebo group (n=78)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age, years</td><td>66·0 (57·0–73·0)</td><td>64·0 (53·0–70·0)</td></tr><tr><td>Sex</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Men</td><td>89 (56%)</td><td>51 (65%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Women</td><td>69 (44%)</td><td>27 (35%)</td></tr><tr><td>Any comorbidities</td><td>112 (71%)</td><td>55 (71%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Hypertension</td><td>72 (46%)</td><td>30 (38%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Diabetes</td><td>40 (25%)</td><td>16 (21%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Coronary heart disease</td><td>15 (9%)</td><td>2 (3%)</td></tr><tr><td>Body temperature, °C</td><td>36·8 (36·5–37·2)</td><td>36·8 (36·5–37·2)</td></tr><tr><td>Fever</td><td>56 (35%)</td><td>31 (40%)</td></tr><tr><td>Respiratory rate &gt;24 breaths per min</td><td>36 (23%)</td><td>11 (14%)</td></tr><tr><td>White blood cell count, × 10<sup>9</sup> per L</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Median</td><td>6·2 (4·4–8·3)</td><td>6·4 (4·5–8·3)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>4–10</td><td>108/155 (70%)</td><td>58 (74%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&lt;4</td><td>27/155 (17%)</td><td>12 (15%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&gt;10</td><td>20/155 (13%)</td><td>8 (10%)</td></tr><tr><td>Lymphocyte count, × 10<sup>9</sup> per L</td><td>0·8 (0·6–1·1)</td><td>0·7 (0·6–1·2)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>≥1·0</td><td>49/155 (32%)</td><td>23 (29%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&lt;1·0</td><td>106/155 (68%)</td><td>55 (71%)</td></tr><tr><td>Platelet count, × 10<sup>9</sup> per L</td><td>183·0 (144·0–235·0)</td><td>194·5 (141·0–266·0)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>≥100</td><td>148/155 (95%)</td><td>75 (96%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&lt;100</td><td>7/155 (5%)</td><td>3 (4%)</td></tr><tr><td>Serum creatinine, μmol/L</td><td>68·0 (56·0–82·0)</td><td>71·3 (56·0–88·7)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>≤133</td><td>151/154 (98%)</td><td>76 (97%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&gt;133</td><td>3/154 (2%)</td><td>2 (3%)</td></tr><tr><td>Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L</td><td>31·0 (22·0–44·0)</td><td>33·0 (24·0–48·0)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>≤40</td><td>109/155 (70%)</td><td>49 (63%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&gt;40</td><td>46/155 (30%)</td><td>29 (37%)</td></tr><tr><td>Alanine aminotransferase, U/L</td><td>26·0 (18·0–42·0)</td><td>26·0 (20·0–43·0)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>≤50</td><td>130/155 (84%)</td><td>66 (85%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&gt;50</td><td>25/155 (16%)</td><td>12 (15%)</td></tr><tr><td>Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L</td><td>339·0 (247·0–441·5)</td><td>329·0 (249·0–411·0)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>≤245</td><td>36/148 (24%)</td><td>17/75 (23%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&gt;245</td><td>112/148 (76%)</td><td>58/75 (77%)</td></tr><tr><td>Creatine kinase, U/L</td><td>75·9 (47·0–131·1)</td><td>75·0 (47·0–158·0)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>≤185</td><td>118/141 (84%)</td><td>54/67 (81%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&gt;185</td><td>23/141 (16%)</td><td>13/67 (19%)</td></tr><tr><td>National Early Warning Score 2 level at day 1</td><td>5·0 (3·0–7·0)</td><td>4·0 (3·0–6·0)</td></tr><tr><td>Six-category scale at day 1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2—hospital admission, not requiring supplemental oxygen</td><td>0</td><td>3 (4%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3—hospital admission, requiring supplemental oxygen</td><td>129 (82%)</td><td>65 (83%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>4—hospital admission, requiring high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive mechanical ventilation</td><td>28 (18%)</td><td>9 (12%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5—hospital admission, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive mechanical ventilation</td><td>0</td><td>1 (1%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>6—death</td><td>1 (1%)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline viral load of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, log<sub>10</sub> copies per mL</td><td>4·7 (0·3)</td><td>4·7 (0·4)</td></tr><tr><td>Receiving interferon alfa-2b at baseline</td><td>29 (18%)</td><td>15 (19%)</td></tr><tr><td>Receiving lopinavir–ritonavir at baseline</td><td>27 (17%)</td><td>15 (19%)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibiotic treatment at baseline</td><td>121 (77%)</td><td>63 (81%)</td></tr><tr><td>Corticosteroids therapy at baseline</td><td>60 (38%)</td><td>31 (40%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are median (IQR), n (%), n/N (%), or mean (SE).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Median time from symptom onset to starting study treatment was 10 days (IQR 9–12).
