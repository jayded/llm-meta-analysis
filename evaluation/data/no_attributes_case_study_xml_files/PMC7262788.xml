<abstract><title>Abstract</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P&lt;0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

Of those assigned to receive remdesivir, 531 patients (98.2%) received the treatment as assigned. Fifty-two patients had remdesivir treatment discontinued before day 10 because of an adverse event or a serious adverse event other than death and 10 withdrew consent. Of those assigned to receive placebo, 517 patients (99.2%) received placebo as assigned. Seventy patients discontinued placebo before day 10 because of an adverse event or a serious adverse event other than death and 14 withdrew consent.</p><p>A total of 517 patients in the remdesivir group and 508 in the placebo group completed the trial through day 29, recovered, or died. Fourteen patients who received remdesivir and 9 who received placebo terminated their participation in the trial before day 29. A total of 54 of the patients who were in the mild-to-moderate stratum at randomization were subsequently determined to meet the criteria for severe disease, resulting in 105 patients in the mild-to-moderate disease stratum and 957 in the severe stratum. The as-treated population included 1048 patients who received the assigned treatment (532 in the remdesivir group, including one patient who had been randomly assigned to placebo and received remdesivir, and 516 in the placebo group).</p><p>The mean age of the patients was 58.9 years, and 64.4% were male (<xref>Table 1</xref>). On the basis of the evolving epidemiology of Covid-19 during the trial, 79.8% of patients were enrolled at sites in North America, 15.3% in Europe, and 4.9% in Asia (Table S1 in the <xref>Supplementary Appendix</xref>). Overall, 53.3% of the patients were White, 21.3% were Black, 12.7% were Asian, and 12.7% were designated as other or not reported; 250 (23.5%) were Hispanic or Latino. Most patients had either one (25.9%) or two or more (54.5%) of the prespecified coexisting conditions at enrollment, most commonly hypertension (50.2%), obesity (44.8%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (30.3%).</p><p>The median number of days between symptom onset and randomization was 9 (interquartile range, 6 to 12) (Table S2). A total of 957 patients (90.1%) had severe disease at enrollment; 285 patients (26.8%) met category 7 criteria on the ordinal scale, 193 (18.2%) category 6, 435 (41.0%) category 5, and 138 (13.0%) category 4. Eleven patients (1.0%) had missing ordinal scale data at enrollment; all these patients discontinued the study before treatment. During the study, 373 patients (35.6% of the 1048 patients in the as-treated population) received hydroxychloroquine and 241 (23.0%) received a glucocorticoid (Table S3).</p></sec><sec><title>Primary Outcome</title><p>Patients in the remdesivir group had a shorter time to recovery than patients in the placebo group (median, 10 days, as compared with 15 days; rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12 to 1.49; P&lt;0.001) (<xref>Figure 2</xref> and <xref>Table 2</xref>). In the severe disease stratum (957 patients) the median time to recovery was 11 days, as compared with 18 days (rate ratio for recovery, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.52) (Table S4). The rate ratio for recovery was largest among patients with a baseline ordinal score of 5 (rate ratio for recovery, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.79); among patients with a baseline score of 4 and those with a baseline score of 6, the rate ratio estimates for recovery were 1.29 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.83) and 1.09 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.57), respectively. For those receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO at enrollment (baseline ordinal score of 7), the rate ratio for recovery was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.36). Information on interactions of treatment with baseline ordinal score as a continuous variable is provided in Table S11. An analysis adjusting for baseline ordinal score as a covariate was conducted to evaluate the overall effect (of the percentage of patients in each ordinal score category at baseline) on the primary outcome. This adjusted analysis produced a similar treatment-effect estimate (rate ratio for recovery, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.46). Patients who underwent randomization during the first 10 days after the onset of symptoms had a rate ratio for recovery of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.64), whereas patients who underwent randomization more than 10 days after the onset of symptoms had a rate ratio for recovery of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.52) (<xref>Figure 3</xref>). The benefit of remdesivir was larger when given earlier in the illness, though the benefit persisted in most analyses of duration of symptoms (Table S6). Sensitivity analyses in which data were censored at earliest reported use of glucocorticoids or hydroxychloroquine still showed efficacy of remdesivir (9.0 days to recovery with remdesivir vs. 14.0 days to recovery with placebo; rate ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.50, and 10.0 vs. 16.0 days to recovery; rate ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.58, respectively) (Table S8).</p></sec><sec><title>Key Secondary Outcome</title><p>The odds of improvement in the ordinal scale score were higher in the remdesivir group, as determined by a proportional odds model at the day 15 visit, than in the placebo group (odds ratio for improvement, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, adjusted for disease severity) (<xref>Table 2</xref> and Fig. S7).</p></sec><sec><title>Mortality</title><p>Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality by day 15 were 6.7% in the remdesivir group and 11.9% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.83); the estimates by day 29 were 11.4% and 15.2% in two groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). The between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to baseline severity (<xref>Table 2</xref>), with the largest difference seen among patients with a baseline ordinal score of 5 (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.64). Information on interactions of treatment with baseline ordinal score with respect to mortality is provided in Table S11.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Secondary Outcomes</title><p>Patients in the remdesivir group had a shorter time to improvement of one or of two categories on the ordinal scale from baseline than patients in the placebo group (one-category improvement: median, 7 vs. 9 days; rate ratio for recovery, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.41; two-category improvement: median, 11 vs. 14 days; rate ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.48) (<xref>Table 3</xref>). Patients in the remdesivir group had a shorter time to discharge or to a National Early Warning Score of 2 or lower than those in the placebo group (median, 8 days vs. 12 days; hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.46). The initial length of hospital stay was shorter in the remdesivir group than in the placebo group (median, 12 days vs. 17 days); 5% of patients in the remdesivir group were readmitted to the hospital, as compared with 3% in the placebo group.</p><p>Among the 913 patients receiving oxygen at enrollment, those in the remdesivir group continued to receive oxygen for fewer days than patients in the placebo group (median, 13 days vs. 21 days), and the incidence of new oxygen use among patients who were not receiving oxygen at enrollment was lower in the remdesivir group than in the placebo group (incidence, 36% [95% CI, 26 to 47] vs. 44% [95% CI, 33 to 57]). For the 193 patients receiving noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen at enrollment, the median duration of use of these interventions was 6 days in both the remdesivir and placebo groups. Among the 573 patients who were not receiving noninvasive ventilation, high-flow oxygen, invasive ventilation, or ECMO at baseline, the incidence of new noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen use was lower in the remdesivir group than in the placebo group (17% [95% CI, 13 to 22] vs. 24% [95% CI, 19 to 30]). Among the 285 patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO at enrollment, patients in the remdesivir group received these interventions for fewer subsequent days than those in the placebo group (median, 17 days vs. 20 days), and the incidence of new mechanical ventilation or ECMO use among the 766 patients who were not receiving these interventions at enrollment was lower in the remdesivir group than in the placebo group (13% [95% CI, 10 to 17] vs. 23% [95% CI, 19 to 27]) (<xref>Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety Outcomes</title><p>In the as-treated population, serious adverse events occurred in 131 of 532 patients (24.6%) in the remdesivir group and in 163 of 516 patients (31.6%) in the placebo group (Table S17). There were 47 serious respiratory failure adverse events in the remdesivir group (8.8% of patients), including acute respiratory failure and the need for endotracheal intubation, and 80 in the placebo group (15.5% of patients) (Table S19). No deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to treatment assignment.</p><p>Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred on or before day 29 in 273 patients (51.3%) in the remdesivir group and in 295 (57.2%) in the placebo group (Table S18); 41 events were judged by the investigators to be related to remdesivir and 47 events to placebo (Table S17). The most common nonserious adverse events occurring in at least 5% of all patients included decreased glomerular filtration rate, decreased hemoglobin level, decreased lymphocyte count, respiratory failure, anemia, pyrexia, hyperglycemia, increased blood creatinine level, and increased blood glucose level (Table S20). The incidence of these adverse events was generally similar in the remdesivir and placebo groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Crossover</title><p>After the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the preliminary primary analysis report be provided to the sponsor, data on a total of 51 patients (4.8% of the total study enrollment) — 16 (3.0%) in the remdesivir group and 35 (6.7%) in the placebo group — were unblinded; 26 (74.3%) of those in the placebo group whose data were unblinded were given remdesivir. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the unblinding (patients whose treatment assignments were unblinded had their data censored at the time of unblinding) and crossover (patients in the placebo group treated with remdesivir had their data censored at the initiation of remdesivir treatment) produced results similar to those of the primary analysis (Table S9).</p></sec></sec><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Enrollment and Randomization.</title></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><fig><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Cumulative Recoveries.</title><p>Cumulative recovery estimates are shown in the overall population (Panel A), in patients with a baseline score of 4 on the ordinal scale (not receiving oxygen; Panel B), in those with a baseline score of 5 (receiving oxygen; Panel C), in those with a baseline score of 6 (receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive mechanical ventilation; Panel D), and in those with a baseline score of 7 (receiving mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]; Panel E).</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><fig><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Time to Recovery According to Subgroup.</title><p>The widths of the confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity and therefore cannot be used to infer treatment effects.

Scores on the ordinal scale are as follows: 1, not hospitalized, no limitations of activities; 2, not hospitalized, limitation of activities, home oxygen requirement, or both; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care (used if hospitalization was extended for infection-control reasons); 4, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen but requiring ongoing medical care (Covid-19–related or other medical conditions); 5, hospitalized, requiring any supplemental oxygen; 6, hospitalized, requiring noninvasive ventilation or use of high-flow oxygen devices; 7, hospitalized, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); and 8, death. Odds ratios and P values were calculated with the use of a proportional odds model (overall model adjusted for actual disease severity). Odds ratio values greater than 1 indicate a benefit with remdesivir.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Additional Secondary Outcomes.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic></graphic><table><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th></th><th>Remdesivir<break></break>(N=541)</th><th>Placebo<break></break>(N=521)</th><th>Rate Ratio<break></break>(95% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>Median time to clinical improvement (95% CI) — days</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Improvement of one category on ordinal scale</td><td>7.0 (6.0 to 8.0)</td><td>9.0 (8.0 to 11.0)</td><td>1.23 (1.08 to 1.41)</td></tr><tr><td>Improvement of two categories on ordinal scale</td><td>11.0 (10.0 to 13.0)</td><td>14.0 (13.0 to 15.0)</td><td>1.29 (1.12 to 1.48)</td></tr><tr><td>Discharge or National Early Warning Score ≤2 for 24 hr<xref>*</xref></td><td>8.0 (7.0 to 9.0)</td><td>12.0 (10.0 to 15.0)</td><td>1.27 (1.10 to 1.46)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><bold>Difference (95% CI)</bold></td></tr><tr><td><bold>Hospitalization</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Median duration of initial hospitalization (IQR) — days<xref>†</xref></td><td>12 (6 to 28)</td><td>17 (8 to 28)</td><td>−5.0 (−7.7 to −2.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Median duration of initial hospitalization among those who did not die (IQR) — days</td><td>10 (5 to 21)</td><td>14 (7 to 27)</td><td>−4.0 (−6.0 to −2.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Patients rehospitalized — % (95% CI)</td><td>5 (3 to 7)</td><td>3 (2 to 5)</td><td>2 percentage points<break></break>(0 to 4)</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Oxygen</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Median days receiving oxygen if receiving oxygen at baseline (IQR)</td><td>13 (5 to 28)</td><td>21 (8 to 28)</td><td>−8.0 (−11.8 to −4.2)</td></tr><tr><td>New use of oxygen</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No. of patients/total no.</td><td>27/75</td><td>28/63</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Percent of patients (95% CI)</td><td>36 (26 to 47)</td><td>44 (33 to 57)</td><td>−8 (−24 to 8)</td></tr><tr><td>Median days receiving oxygen (IQR)</td><td>4 (2 to 12)</td><td>5.5 (1 to 15)</td><td>−1.0 (−7.6 to 5.6)</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Median days of noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen use during study if receiving these interventions at baseline (IQR)</td><td>6 (3 to 18)</td><td>6 (3 to 16)</td><td>0 (−2.6 to 2.6)</td></tr><tr><td>New use of new noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen use during the study</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No. of patients/total no.</td><td>52/307</td><td>64/266</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Percent of patients (95% CI)</td><td>17 (13 to 22)</td><td>24 (19 to 30)</td><td>−7 (−14 to −1)</td></tr><tr><td>Median days of use during the study (IQR)</td><td>3 (1 to 10.5)</td><td>4 (2 to 23.5)</td><td>−1.0 (−4.0 to 2.0)</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Mechanical ventilation or ECMO</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Median days of mechanical ventilation or ECMO during study if receiving these interventions at baseline (IQR)</td><td>17 (9 to 28)</td><td>20 (8 to 28)</td><td>−3.0 (−9.3 to 3.3)</td></tr><tr><td>New use of mechanical ventilation or ECMO during study</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No. of patients/total no.</td><td>52/402</td><td>82/364</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Percent of patients (95% CI)</td><td>13 (10 to 17)</td><td>23 (19 to 27)</td><td>−10 (−15 to −4)</td></tr><tr><td>Median days of use during the study (IQR)</td><td>21.5 (9 to 28)</td><td>23 (12 to 28)</td><td>1.0 (−6.0 to 8.0)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn><label>*</label><p>The National Early Warning Score includes six physiological measures; total scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater clinical risk.</p></fn><fn><label>†</label><p>The duration of initial hospitalization for patients who died was imputed as 28 days.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
