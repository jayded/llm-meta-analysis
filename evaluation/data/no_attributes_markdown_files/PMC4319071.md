Abstract

## Background

Web-based, computer-tailored nutrition education interventions can be
effective in modifying self-reported dietary behaviors. Traditional
computer-tailored programs primarily targeted individual cognitions
(knowledge, awareness, attitude, self-efficacy). Tailoring on additional
variables such as self-regulation processes and environmental-level
factors (the home food environment arrangement and perception of
availability and prices of healthy food products in supermarkets) may
improve efficacy and effect sizes (ES) of Web-based computer-tailored
nutrition education interventions.

## Objective

This study evaluated the short- and medium-term efficacy and educational
differences in efficacy of a cognitive and environmental feedback
version of a Web-based computer-tailored nutrition education
intervention on self-reported fruit, vegetable, high-energy snack, and
saturated fat intake compared to generic nutrition information in the
total sample and among participants who did not comply with dietary
guidelines (the risk groups).

## Methods

A randomized controlled trial was conducted with a basic (tailored
intervention targeting individual cognition and self-regulation
processes; n=456), plus (basic intervention additionally targeting
environmental-level factors; n=459), and control (generic nutrition
information; n=434) group. Participants were recruited from the general
population and randomly assigned to a study group. Self-reported fruit,
vegetable, high-energy snack, and saturated fat intake were assessed at
baseline and at 1- (T1) and 4-months (T2) postintervention using online
questionnaires. Linear mixed model analyses examined group differences
in change over time. Educational differences were examined with
group×time×education interaction terms.

## Results

In the total sample, the basic (T1: ES=--0.30; T2: ES=--0.18) and plus
intervention groups (T1: ES=--0.29; T2: ES=--0.27) had larger decreases
in high-energy snack intake than the control group. The basic version
resulted in a larger decrease in saturated fat intake than the control
intervention (T1: ES=--0.19; T2: ES=--0.17). In the risk groups, the
basic version caused larger decreases in fat (T1: ES=--0.28; T2:
ES=--0.28) and high-energy snack intake (T1: ES=--0.34; T2: ES=--0.20)
than the control intervention. The plus version resulted in a larger
increase in fruit (T1: ES=0.25; T2: ES=0.37) and a larger decrease in
high-energy snack intake (T1: ES=--0.38; T2: ES=--0.32) than the control
intervention. For high-energy snack intake, educational differences were
found. Stratified analyses showed that the plus version was most
effective for high-educated participants.

## Conclusions

Both intervention versions were more effective in improving some of the
self-reported dietary behaviors than generic nutrition information,
especially in the risk groups, among both higher- and lower-educated
participants. For fruit intake, only the plus version was more effective
than providing generic nutrition information. Although feasible,
incorporating environmental-level information is time-consuming.
Therefore, the basic version may be more feasible for further
implementation, although inclusion of feedback on the arrangement of the
home food environment and on availability and prices may be considered
for fruit and, for high-educated people, for high-energy snack intake.

# Results

## Participant Characteristics at Baseline

A total of 1349 participants were included in the analyses. The mean age
of the participants was 49.05 years (SD 10.62), 35.43% (478/1349) were
male, 1.34% (18/1348) had a non-Western ethnic background, and 45.66%
(616/1349) were in the high-educated group ([Table 1](#)). The mean
daily vegetable intake was 159.12 grams (SD 69.24), daily fruit intake
was 1.85 pieces (SD 1.29), daily high-energy snack intake was 3.34
pieces (SD 2.98), and mean saturated fat intake was 17.91 fat points (SD
6.07). The sizes of the risk groups were as follows: 1014 participants
(75.17%) did not comply with the recommendation of 200 grams of
vegetables a day, 803 participants (59.53%) did not comply with the
guideline of 2 pieces of fruit per day, 808 participants (59.90%)
consumed more than 2 high-energy snacks per day, and 627 participants
(46.48%) did not comply with the age- and gender-specific guidelines for
maximum fat intake. The plus group was significantly younger than the
control group (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, *P*=.04) and the plus group
consisted of more lower-educated people than the basic group (OR 1.33,
95% CI 1.01-1.74, *P*=.04). Hence, age and education were included in
the repeated measures analyses as covariates in addition to place of
residence.

## Loss to Follow-Up

A total of 1349 participants filled out the baseline questionnaire, 902
participants filled out the complete first follow-up questionnaire
(33.14% dropout), and 766 participants completely filled out the second
follow-up questionnaire (43.22% dropout) ([Figure 2](#)). Younger
participants were more likely to drop out between baseline and T1 (OR
1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, *P*=.002) and T2 (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04,
*P*\<.001) compared to older participants. Dropout between baseline and
T1 was higher in the basic (34.6%, 158/456; OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07-1.90,
*P*=.02) and the plus group (37.3%, 171/459; OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.17-2.07,
*P*=.003) than in the control group (27.2%, 118/434). Dropout between
baseline and T2 was also higher in the basic (44.3%, 202/456; OR 1.36,
95% CI 1.04-1.80, *P*=.03) and plus group (48.4%, 222/459; OR 1.58, 95%
CI 1.20-2.07, *P=*.001) than in the control group (36.6%, 159/434).

## Assessment of Moderation by Educational Level

No significant interaction effects with educational level were found in
the total sample and risk groups for fruit, vegetable, and saturated fat
intake. Therefore, stratified analyses by educational level were not
indicated for these behaviors. For high-energy snack intake, the
interaction with education was borderline significant in both the total
sample (*F*~4,932.32~=2.34, *P*=.053) and risk group
(*F*~4,533.59~=2.37, *P*=.051). Therefore, stratified analyses by
educational level were performed as additional analyses for high-energy
snack intake.

## Intervention Effects

### Fruit Intake

Even though fruit intake increased over time (*F*~2,953.39~=38.44,
*P*\<.001), there was no difference in change over time between the 3
groups (*F*~4,1151.24~=1.09, *P*=.36) in the total sample ([Tables 2](#)
and [3](#)).

Among participants who consumed less than 2 pieces of fruit at baseline
(n=803), a significant difference in change over time was found between
the groups (*F*~4.523.71~=3.61, *P*=.007). The plus group had a
significantly larger increase in fruit intake than the control group,
between baseline and both T1 (plus vs control: ES =0.25, *P*=.01) and T2
(plus vs control: ES =0.37, *P*=.001). At medium term, the plus version
also resulted in a larger increase in fruit intake than the basic
version (plus vs basic: ES =0.22, *P*=.04) ([Tables 4](#) and [5](#)).

### Vegetable Intake

Vegetable intake increased over time in the total sample
(*F*~2,906.08~=16.69, *P*\<.001), but there was no difference in change
over time between the 3 groups (*F*~4,905.49~=1.97, *P*=.10) ([Tables
2](#) and [3](#)). The same results were found in the risk group:
vegetable intake increased over time (*F*~2,654.00~=72.11, *P*\<.001),
but no difference between the 3 groups was found (*F*~4,671.86~=2.15,
*P*=.07)([Tables 4](#) and [5](#)).

### High-Energy Snack Intake

High-energy snack intake had a very skewed distribution and, therefore,
was log-transformed. The significance tests were based on the
log-transformed variable, but the unstandardized regression coefficients
and ES were based on the original variable.

In the total sample, there was a significant difference in decrease of
high-energy snacks between the groups (*F*~4,933.35~=5.77, *P*\<.001).
Both intervention groups had a significantly larger decrease in
high-energy snack intake than the control group between baseline and
both T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.30, *P*\<.001; plus vs control: ES
=--0.29, *P*=.001) and T2 (basic vs control: ES =--0.18, *P*=.006; plus
vs control: ES =--0.27, *P*=.002) ([Tables 2](#) and [3](#)).

Stratified analyses showed that for lower-educated participants both the
basic and plus version resulted in a larger decrease than the control
intervention between baseline and T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.33,
*P*\<.001; plus vs control: ES =--0.23, *P*=.02). Between baseline and
T2, only the basic version resulted in a larger decrease than the
control intervention (basic vs control: ES =--0.23, *P*=.009). For
high-educated participants, both intervention groups had a larger
decrease than the control group between baseline and T1 (basic vs
control: ES =--0.31, *P*=.006; plus vs control: ES =--0.38, *P*=.01*).*
Between baseline and T2, the plus version resulted in a larger decrease
than the control intervention (plus vs control: ES =--0.53, *P*\<.001)
and basic version (plus vs basic: ES =--0.32, *P*=.04).

Also in the risk group (n=808), significant differences in change over
time were found (*F*~4,534.96~=4.30, *P*=.002). Both intervention groups
had a significant larger decrease than the control group between
baseline and T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.34, *P*\<.001; plus vs
control: ES =--0.38, *P*=.001) and T2 (basic vs control: ES =--0.20,
*P*=.02; plus vs control: ES =--0.32, *P*=.008) ([Tables 4](#) and
[5](#)).

Stratified analyses showed that among lower-educated participants only
the basic version resulted in a larger decrease in high-energy snack
intake than the control intervention between baseline and both T1 (basic
vs control: ES =--0.40, *P*=.002) and T2 (basic vs control: ES =--0.26,
*P*=.03). For higher-educated participants, both intervention groups had
a larger decrease than the control group between baseline and T1 (basic
vs control: ES =--0.34, *P*=.02; plus vs control: ES=--0.50, *P*=.001).
Between baseline and T2, the plus version resulted in a larger decrease
than the control intervention (plus vs control: ES =--0.64, *P*\<.001)
and basic version (plus vs basic: ES =--0.38, *P*=.03).

### Fat Intake

Differences in change over time between the groups were found
(*F*~4,919.65~=3.02, *P*=.02) in the total sample. The basic group had a
larger decrease in saturated fat intake than the control group between
baseline and both T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.19, *P*=.001) and T2
(basic vs control: ES =--0.17, *P*=.01). In addition, the decrease
between baseline and T1 was significantly smaller for the plus group
compared to the basic group (plus vs basic: ES =0.12, *P*=.045) ([Tables
2](#) and [3](#)).

Also in the risk group (n=627), differences in change over time between
the groups were found (*F*~4,441.26~=2.99, *P*=.02). The basic group had
a significantly larger decrease in saturated fat intake than the control
group between baseline and both T1 (basic vs control: ES=--0.28,
*P*=.006) and T2 (basic vs control: ES=--0.28, *P*=.01). Between
baseline and T1, the decrease was lower for the plus group than for the
basic group (plus vs basic: ES =0.24, *P*=.02) ([Tables 4](#) and
[5](#)).
