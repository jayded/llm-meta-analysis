# Abstract ## Background Exhaustive exercise causes muscle damage accompanied by oxidative stress and inflammation leading to muscle fatigue and muscle soreness. Lemon verbena leaves, commonly used as tea and refreshing beverage, demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a proprietary lemon verbena extract (Recoverben®) on muscle strength and recovery after exhaustive exercise in comparison to a placebo product. ## Methods The study was performed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with parallel design. Forty-four healthy males and females, which were 22--50 years old and active in sports, were randomized to 400 mg lemon verbena extract once daily or placebo. The 15 days intervention was divided into 10 days supplementation prior to the exhaustive exercise day (intensive jump-protocol), one day during the test and four days after. Muscle strength (MVC), muscle damage (CK), oxidative stress (GPx), inflammation (IL6) and volunteer-reported muscle soreness intensity were assessed pre and post exercise. ## Results Participants in the lemon verbena group benefited from less muscle damage as well as faster and full recovery. Compared to placebo, lemon verbena extract receiving participants had significantly less exercise-related loss of muscle strength (*p* = 0.0311) over all timepoints, improved glutathione peroxidase activity by trend (*p* = 0.0681) and less movement induced pain (*p* = 0.0788) by trend. Creatine kinase and IL-6 didn't show significant discrimmination between groups. ## Conclusion Lemon verbena extract (Recoverben®) has been shown to be a safe and well-tolerated natural sports ingredient, by reducing muscle damage after exhaustive exercise. ## Trial registration The trial was registered in the clinical trials registry (clinical trial.gov [NCT02923102](#)). Registered 28 September 2016 # Results ## Group characteristics Out of 44 subjects allocated to intervention, 40 subjects (19 men and 21 women) completed the study according to the protocol (full analysis set; FAS). Four subjects dropped out after start of supplementation and before efficacy testing. Three of these suffered from a common cold, which did not allow them to perform the exhaustive exercise test, and one dropped out due to personal decision. Thirty-seven subjects were analyzed for valid case analysis set (VCAS). One subject had a strong common cold during the exhaustive exercise test, which may have influenced biomarker results. Another subject did not meet compliance criteria for study product intake and the third subject had major deviation of the exhaustive exercise protocol. As these three subjects did meet exclusion criteria for VCAS analysis, they were not considered in final analysis (VCAS). Gender, age, BMI, blood routine markers, and blood pressure did not differ significantly between the groups prior to the study. Subject characteristics are summarized in Table [2](#). The nutrition frequency questionnaire scores were 45.35 ± 10.51 points in the lemon verbena group and 42.65 ± 11.33 points in the placebo group (*p* = 0.4597). Most subjects consumed between two and four portions fruits plus vegetables per day (lemon verbena: 82%, placebo: 70%). Intake of fruit and vegetables, as supplier for polyphenols, were comparable between groups. The protocol compliance of study product intake was very good. For VCAS, all subjects met the compliance criterion ≥85% and ≤115% of study preparation consumed (lemon verbena group: 102 ± 5%, placebo: 101 ± 2%). For FAS, one subject had a compliance >115% since much less products remained, bringing up uncertainty about correct intake, which was the reason for exclusion from VCAS. Borg scale data after exhaustive exercise and jump repetitions were not significantly different between groups (*p* = 0.8997, *p* = 0.1561). Therefore, burden of subjects by the exhaustive exercise and jump protocol was comparable between groups, so a comparable stress could be expected. ::::table-wrap

Differences between groups were not significant (*p* = 0.5824). ## Safety and tolerability Blood chemistry, vital signs, adverse events, and concomitant medication did not indicate any safety concerns over 15 days. There was no statistical difference between the two groups for adverse events (*p* = 0.231). The most frequent adverse events were headache (lemon verbena: 5%, placebo: 18%) and common cold (lemon verbena 23%, placebo: 23%). None of the adverse events were serious or related to the study products. The intervention was well tolerated.
