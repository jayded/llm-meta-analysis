Abstract

## Background

Chronic work-related stress is an independent risk factor for
cardiometabolic diseases and associated mortality, particularly when
compounded by a sedentary work environment. The purpose of this study
was to determine if an office worksite-based *hatha* yoga program could
improve physiological stress, evaluated *via* heart rate variability
(HRV), and associated health-related outcomes in a cohort of office
workers.

## Methods

Thirty-seven adults employed in university-based office positions were
randomized upon the completion of baseline testing to an experimental or
control group. The experimental group completed a 10-week yoga program
prescribed three sessions per week during lunch hour (50 min per
session). An experienced instructor led the sessions, which emphasized
*asanas* (postures) and *vinyasa* (exercises). The primary outcome was
the high frequency (HF) power component of HRV. Secondary outcomes
included additional HRV parameters, musculoskeletal fitness (i.e.
push-up, side-bridge, and sit & reach tests) and psychological indices
(i.e. state and trait anxiety, quality of life and job satisfaction).

## Results

All measures of HRV failed to change in the experimental group versus
the control group, except that the experimental group significantly
increased LF:HF (p = 0.04) and reduced pNN50 (p = 0.04) versus control,
contrary to our hypotheses. Flexibility, evaluated *via* sit & reach
test increased in the experimental group versus the control group
(p \< 0.001). No other adaptations were noted. *Post hoc* analysis
comparing participants who completed ≥70% of yoga sessions (n = 11) to
control (n = 19) yielded the same findings, except that the high
adherers also reduced state anxiety (p = 0.02) and RMSSD (p = 0.05), and
tended to improve the push-up test (p = 0.07) versus control.

## Conclusions

A 10-week *hatha* yoga intervention delivered at the office worksite
during lunch hour did not improve HF power or other HRV parameters.
However, improvements in flexibility, state anxiety and musculoskeletal
fitness were noted with high adherence. Future investigations should
incorporate strategies to promote adherence, involve more frequent and
longer durations of yoga training, and enrol cohorts who suffer from
higher levels of work-related stress.

# Results

## Flow of participants

Forty-two individuals (n = 42) expressed an interest in the study, and
were deemed eligible; five withdrew prior to baseline testing with
reasons presented in Figure [1](#). Thirty-seven individuals provided
written informed consent, completed baseline testing, and were
randomized to the yoga (n = 18) or control group (n = 19). One
participant in the yoga group withdrew in week 2 for personal reasons,
while two in the control group failed to complete follow-up testing.
Recruitment resulted in lower participant interest and enrolment than
anticipated \[[22](#)\], and therefore our *a priori* calculation of
statistical power was reduced from 80% to 63%.

## Baseline characteristics

Participant characteristics are presented in Table [1](#). No
statistically significant differences were observed between groups at
baseline on the descriptive characteristics presented. However, due to
potentially clinically important differences in BMI (p = 0.09), this
variable was included as a covariate in all ANCOVA models. The cohort
ranged in age from 21 to 58 years. BMI ranged from 18.3 to 39.2 kg/m^2^,
and seven participants fulfilled the clinical criteria for obesity (i.e.
BMI ≥30.0 kg/m^2^). Two participants were current smokers, while one had
a history of tobacco use but did not currently smoke. Other than
obesity, the most common chronic conditions were asthma (n = 4),
hypercholesterolemia (n = 4) and hypertension (n = 5). None of the
participants were presently engaged in regular yoga practice but nearly
half had prior experience at a beginner level (17/37, 46%). The majority
of participants were administrative staff, technical support staff, or
post-graduate students.

## Correlations between measures of HRV at baseline

Correlation coefficients relating to measures of HRV in the total cohort
at baseline, after normalization of data, are presented in Table [2](#).
Log SDNN, log RMSSD, pNN50, log LF power, log HF power and log total
power were positively, significantly and highly correlated (all
p \< 0.001; all *r* ≥0.69). Log LF:HF was negatively, significantly and
moderately correlated with pNN50 (p = 0.02), log RMSSD (p = 0.01) and
log HF power (p \< 0.001). Resting heart rate was significantly,
negatively and moderately correlated with log SDNN (p = 0.004), log
RMSSD (p = 0.001), pNN50 (p = 0.003), log LF power (p = 0.02), log HF
power (p = 0.003) and log total power (p = 0.01).

## Correlations between state anxiety and HRV measures

Higher levels of state anxiety were associated with higher resting heart
rate (r = 0.51, p = 0.002), lower pNN50 (r = -0.36, p = 0.03), lower log
RMSSD (r = -0.39, p = 0.02), lower log LF power (r = -0.344, p = 0.05),
lower log HF power (r = -0.47, p = 0.01), and lower log total power
(r = -0.40, p = 0.02).

## Attendance and adverse events

Attendance in the yoga group ranged from 33% to 97% and averaged
73 ± 19%. Eleven participants (11/17, 65%) attended ≥70% of the
sessions. No adverse events were documented in either the experimental
or control group during the study.

### HRV and heart rate

Log HF, the primary outcome, did not significantly improve in the yoga
group versus the control group over time (p = 0.48). Contrary to our
hypotheses, the yoga group significantly reduced pNN50 (p = 0.04) and
increased log LF:HF (p = 0.04) versus the control group. No group × time
interaction effects were noted for log SDNN, log RMSSD, log LF power,
log total power or resting heart rate (Table [3](#)).

### Musculoskeletal fitness

Low back and hip flexibility, evaluated *via* sit and reach test,
significantly increased in the yoga group versus the control group
following the intervention period (p \< 0.001). No group × time
interaction effect was noted for the push-up test or the side-bridge
test (Table [3](#)).

### Psychological health status

None of the QoL domain scores changed significantly in the yoga group
versus the control group following the intervention period (data not
shown, all p \> 0.05), nor were group × time effects noted for the QoL
summary scales (i.e. Physical Component Scale and Mental Component
Scale; Table [3](#)). Both groups reduced state and trait anxiety
measures from pre to post intervention; however, no significant group ×
time interaction effects were noted. None of the five domains of job
satisfaction measured *via JDI* changed significantly between groups
over time (data not shown, p \> 0.05), nor did general job satisfaction
measured *via JIG* (Table [3](#)).

## Post hoc analyses

*Post-hoc* analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of adherence
on adaptation. ANCOVA of the post-treatment score controlling for the
baseline score, age and BMI were computed for all outcome measures
between participants who attended ≥70% of the yoga sessions (n = 11)
versus the control group (n = 17). The findings remained unchanged from
the primary analysis, except that the high adherers to yoga
significantly reduced state anxiety (p = 0.02) and RMSSD (p = 0.05), and
tended to improve the push-up test (p = 0.07) versus the control group.
