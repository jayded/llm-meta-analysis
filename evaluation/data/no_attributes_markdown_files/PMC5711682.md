Abstract

## Background and Objectives

This trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the Genoss drug-eluting
coronary stent.

## Methods

This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial with a 1:1
ratio of Genoss drug-eluting stent (DES)™ and Promus Element™. Inclusion
criteria were the presence of stable angina, unstable angina, or silent
ischemia. Angiographic inclusion criteria were de novo coronary stenotic
lesion with diameter stenosis \>50%, reference vessel diameter of
2.5--4.0 mm, and lesion length ≤40 mm. The primary endpoint was in-stent
late lumen loss at 9-month quantitative coronary angiography follow-up.
Secondary endpoints were in-segment late lumen loss, binary restenosis
rate, death, myocardial infarction (MI), target lesion revascularization
(TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), and stent thrombosis
during 9 months of follow-up.

## Results

We enrolled 38 patients for the Genoss DES™ group and 39 patients for
the Promus Element™ group. In-stent late lumen loss at 9 months was not
significantly different between the 2 groups (0.11±0.25 vs. 0.16±0.43
mm, p=0.567). There was no MI or stent thrombosis in either group. The
rates of death (2.6% vs. 0%, p=0.494), TLR (2.6% vs. 2.6%, p=1.000), and
TVR (7.9% vs. 2.6%, p=0.358) at 9 months were not significantly
different.

## Conclusion

This first-in-patient study of the Genoss DES™ stent showed excellent
angiographic outcomes for in-stent late lumen loss and major adverse
cardiac events over a 9-month follow-up.

# RESULTS

Between March 2013 and April 2015, 85 patients were screened for
enrollment in the study. Five patients did not meet inclusion criteria
and a total of 80 patients were randomly assigned to the Genoss DES™ or
Promus Element™ group at a 1:1 ratio. In the Genoss DES™ group, 2
patients were excluded as one patient did not receive stent implantation
and the other patient had a protocol violation. In the Promus Element™
group, 1 patient was excluded owing to the patient\'s withdrawal from
the study ([Figure 1](#)).

Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics are shown in [Tables
1](#) and [2](#), respectively. There were no significant differences in
clinical characteristics including age and clinical diagnosis between
the 2 groups ([Table 1](#)). Target vessels were not significantly
different, but the left anterior descending artery was targeted more
often in the Promus Element™ group. Stent overlap was performed in 8
(21.1%) patients in the Genoss DES™ group and in 3 (7.7%) patients in
the Promus Element™ group ([Table 2](#)).

Angiographic follow-up at 9 months was performed for all patients, and
IVUS follow-up was performed in 35 (92%) patients in the Genoss DES™
group and in 37 (95%) patients in the Promus Element™ group. QCA results
are shown in [Table 3](#). There were no significant differences in RVD.
For the primary endpoint, in-stent late lumen loss at 9 months was not
significantly different between the groups (0.11±0.25 mm for Genoss DES™
vs. 0.16±0.43 mm for Promus Element™, p=0.567) nor was in-segment late
lumen loss (0.11±0.26 mm for Genoss DES™ vs. 0.15±0.43 mm for Promus
Element™, p=0.558). Angiographic restenosis at 9 months was observed in
1 (2.6%) patient in the Genoss DES™ group and in 2 (5.1%) patients in
the Promus Element™ group (p=1.000). IVUS minimal lumen area after
stenting during the index procedure (6.95±1.98 vs. 7.47±2.47 mm^2^,
p=0.272) and after 9 months (6.95±1.98 vs. 7.29±2.34 mm^2^, p=0.508)
were not significantly different ([Table 4](#)). For clinical outcomes,
there were no MI or stent thrombosis events during 9-month follow-up.
One death occurred in the Genoss DES™ group due to aggravated renal
function 6 months after the index procedure. However, the rate of death,
MI, TLR, and TVR at 9 months were not significantly different ([Table
5](#)).
