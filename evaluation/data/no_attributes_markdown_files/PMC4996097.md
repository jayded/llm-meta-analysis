Abstract

## Objectives.

The purpose is to investigate effect of septoplasty and widened nasal
patency on voice quality.

## Methods.

Fifty patients who undergone septoplasty were included in the study.
Thirty-three people who had similar age and distribution were enrolled
as control group. Before and 1 and 3 months after surgery, anterior
rhinomanometry, voice analysis by Multi-Dimensional Voice Program, and
spectrographic analysis were performed to patients. The recordings of
/a/ vowel were used to evaluate average fundamental frequency (F0),
jitter percent, and shimmer percent. In spectrographic analyses, F3--F4
values for the vowels /i, e, a, o, and u/, nasal formant frequencies of
the consonants /m/ and /n/ in the word /mini/, and 4 formant frequencies
(F1, F2, F3, and F4) for nasalized /i/ vowel following a nasal consonant
/n/ in the word /mini/ were compared. The differences in nasal resonance
were evaluated. All patients were asked whether change in their voices
after the surgery. Preoperative and postoperative voice parameters and
anterior rhinomanometry results were compared separately with the
control group as well as in the patient group itself.

## Results.

Preoperative total nasal resistance (TNR) values of patients were higher
than the control group (*P*=0.001). TNR values of patients measured one
day before surgery and after surgery in the 1st and 3rd months were
different and these differences were significant statistically
(*P*=0.001). There was no significant difference between the voice
analysis parameters in preoperative, postoperative 1st, and 3rd months.
As a result of their subjective reviews, 12 patients (36%) noted their
voices were better than before surgery and 20 patients (61%) noted no
change before and after surgery.

## Conclusion.

Providing widened nasal cavity has no effect on voice quality.

# RESULTS

There were 29 men and 21 women in the study group. None of them was
applied sinus surgery. Seven patients who did not come to their
postoperative controls, 3 patients who were observed septal perforation
after septoplasty and could not be done ARM due to perforation, and 7
patients who had higher TNR value than avarage TNR value of control
group were excluded. There were 9 patients applied radiofrequency
ablation and all of them was in excluded group. Except absent patients,
successful septoplasty rate was 77%. The study was conducted with 33
patients who have an increased nasal patency.

Nineteen men (58%) and 14 women (42%) were enrolled as patient group and
the mean age of patients was 25 years (range, 18 to 53 years). The mean
age of control group was 27 years (range, 18 to 51 years) and there was
no significant difference in terms of age and sex between patients and
the control group (*P*\<0.05) ([Table 1](#)).

Preoperative mean TNR value of patients was higher than the control
group's and this difference was significant statistically (*P*=0.001).
Preoperative TNR values of patients decreased post-operatively and these
differences were again significant statistically (*P*=0.001) ([Table
2](#)).

When asked patients whether changes in their voices after surgery, 20
patients (61%) noted no change, 12 patients (36%) said there was a
change in a good way, and one (3%) noted a change in a bad way.

Compared analysis results of /a/ vowel, there was no significant
difference between the values before and 1 and 3 months after surgery
([Table 3](#)). Compared these results with the control group, there was
no significant difference except NHR value (*P*=0.017). This difference
was not reviewed, because it was not related to change of TNR.

Compared analysis results of /n/ nasal consonant; there was no
significant difference between the values before and 1 and 3 months
after surgery. Compared these results with the control group, there were
significant differences statistically about F3 formant freqency in
postoperative 1st and 3rd months (*P*=0.022, *P*=0.024) and F4 formant
frequency in postoperative 1st month (*P*=0.017) ([Table 4](#)). These
differences were not significant clinically because these frequencies
had not significant change in patient group.

Compared analysis results of /mini/ word, there was no significant
difference postoperative and with the control group ([Table 5](#)).
