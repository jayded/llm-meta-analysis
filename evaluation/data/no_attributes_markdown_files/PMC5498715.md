# Abstract ## Background Physical activity (PA) prevents chronic diseases. Self-determination theory (SDT) provides a useful framework to understand the nature of motivational interviewing (MI). ## Objective This study aimed to determine the effect of MI-based intervention using SDT on the promotion of PA among women in reproductive age. ## Methods Seventy women in reproductive age were selected by clustering sampling method for this randomized controlled trial. The questionnaire included the variables of physical fitness test, SDT, and global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ). The validity of the questionnaires was approved using content validity ratio (CVR) and index (CVI). The reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaires and measures was approved using test-retest method and Cronbach's alpha test, respectively. The intervention group (n=35) received four MI sessions through theory and one standard education session about PA. The control group (n=35) received a standard education session about PA. ## Results Four months after the intervention, an increase in the mean scores of total PA (p<0.001, ES=4.77), physical fitness tests including flexibility (p<0.001, ES=1.59), muscular endurance (p<0.001, ES=2.0), cardiorespiratory endurance (p<0.001, ES=0.51), and a decrease in mean scores of agility test (p<0.001, ES= − 0.51) and sedentary behavior (p<0.01, ES=− 0.74) was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of intrinsic motivation (p<0.001, ES=3.34), identified regulation (p<0.001, ES= 1.28), perceptions of competence (p<0.001, ES=0.81) and autonomy (p<0.001, ES=2.01), enjoyment (p<0.001, ES=0.98) and health motives (p<0.01, ES=0.19), health care climate (p<0.001, ES=4.6), and a decreased score of external regulation (p<0.01, ES=−0.55) and amotivation (p<0.01, ES= −0.56) over time, compared to the control group. ## Conclusion MI-based intervention using SDT was effective on the promotion of PA. ## Trial registration The Trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial ([http://www.irct.ir](#)) with the Irct ID: IRCT2015101924592N1. # 3. Results Seventy women in reproductive age were randomly assigned to the randomized controlled trial. With Chi-squared test, no significant difference was observed between intervention and control groups regarding the demographic characteristics (age, educational level, job, spouse's job) and body composition (p>0.05). ## 3.1. SDT components The results of the psychological variables of SDT are shown in [Table 2](#). With repeated measures test, the intervention group showed a higher level of autonomy, identified regulation, perception of competence, challenge and enjoyment motives through time than before the intervention. Friedman's non-parametric test also showed an increased intrinsic motivation, introjected regulation, perception of self-determination and fitness/health motive and a reduction in amotivation in the intervention group compared to before intervention over time ([Table 2](#)). Comparing the intervention and control groups within 4 months, variables such as intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, perception of autonomy, perception of competence and perception of relatedness, enjoyment motive, and health care climate, indicated moderate to high effect sizes. Conversely, introjected regulation, external regulation, amotivation and fitness/health, challenge, social and appearance motives, showed low or negative effect sizes ([Table 3](#)). ## 3.2. Physical activity and sedentary behavior With repeated measures tests, the participants in the intervention group showed a higher level of PA over time and a lower level of sedentary behavior in the non-parametric Friedman test compared to pre-intervention time ([Table 2](#)). Within 4 months after intervention, the subjects in the intervention group showed higher level of PA with high effect size and lower level of sedentary behavior with negative effect size compared with the control group. ## 3.3. Body composition and physical fitness tests In the intervention group, the repeated measures tests showed a significant reduction in body mass index, and paired t-test showed a significant increase in body flexibility, muscle endurance, and cardiorespiratory endurance and a significant reduction in agility score over time ([Table 2](#)). The subjects in the intervention group indicated lower scores of body mass index and agility, with a negative effect size and higher levels of cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular endurance and flexibility of the body with medium to high effect sizes, in 4 months after intervention compared with the control group ([Table 4](#)). ::::table-wrap

  First session: Introducing the motivational approach, facilitators' philosophy, and group principles-with an emphasis on the principle of avoiding the intention to reform the client   Knowing motivational approach
  Knowing the facilitator philosophy (supporting the autonomy)
