Abstract

## Background and purpose

The trabecular metal tibial monoblock component (TM) is a relatively new
option available for total knee arthroplasty. We have previously
reported a large degree of early migration of the trabecular metal
component in a subset of patients. These implants all appeared to
stabilize at 2 years. We now present 5-year RSA results of the TM and
compare them with those of the NexGen Option Stemmed cemented tibial
component (Zimmer, Warsaw IN).

## Patients and methods

70 patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to receive either the TM
implant or the cemented component. RSA examination was done
postoperatively and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years. RSA
outcomes were translations, rotations, and maximum total point motion
(MTPM) of the components. MTPM values were used to classify implants as
"at risk" or "stable".

## Results

At the 5-year follow-up, 45 patients were available for analysis. There
were 27 in the TM group and 18 in the cemented group. MTPM values were
similar in the 2 groups (p = 0.9). The TM components had significantly
greater subsidence than the cemented components (p = 0.001). The
proportion of "at risk" components at 5 years was 2 of 18 in the
cemented group and 0 of 27 in the TM group (p = 0.2).

## Interpretation

In the previous 2-year report, we expressed our uncertainty concerning
the long-term stability of the TM implant due to the high initial
migration seen in some cases. Here, we report stability of this implant
up to 5 years in all cases. The implant appears to achieve solid
fixation despite high levels of migration initially.

# Results

## Standard outcomes and follow-up

All standard outcome measures for the 45 patients in this study are
given in [Table 1](#). Originally, 37 patients were randomized to
receive the trabecular metal component and 33 received the cemented
component. Age and BMI were similar in the 2 groups at the time of
admission. There were no differences in subjective measures (WOMAC)
between implant groups at any follow-up point.

For the 5-year follow-up, 45 patients could be reached and were willing
to participate. There were 27/28 of the trabecular metal subjects and
18/21 cemented subjects with 2-year data recruited. The reasons for loss
to follow-up for the other 25 patients are documented in [Figure 1](#)
and it happened mainly in the first two years of follow-up. Of the
patients with a high degree of prosthesis migration in the original
study, all 9 were recruited to the 5-year follow-up. All but 3 of the
patients originally recruited to the study are still being followed by
the operative surgeon, and there have been no revisions to date. The
three patients who were exceptions had left the province.

## RSA results

The accuracy of the RSA system was 0.025 mm, 0.025 mm, 0.063 mm, and
0.026 mm for the x-, y-, and z- directions and maximum total point
motion, respectively. The precision of the RSA system was 0.07 mm, 0.07
mm, and 0.11 mm for x-, y-, and z- translations, 0.16°, 0.15°, and 0.12°
for x-, y-, and z- rotations, and 0.10 mm for maximum total point
motion.

At the 2-year follow-up, there were no subjects "at risk" in the
trabecular metal group (0/28). At the 5-year follow-up, none of the
trabecular metal components were found to be "at risk". At the 2-year
follow-up, there were 4 subjects "at risk" in the cemented group (4/21).
At the 5-year follow-up, 1 of the cemented components "at risk" was lost
to follow-up, 2 stabilized (0.09 mm and 0.07 mm of movement between 2
and 5 years) and 1 continued to migrate (0.35 mm of movement between 2
and 5 years). 1 of the cemented implants found to be stable at 2 years
migrated an additional 0.42 mm and was classified as being "at risk".
However, retrospectively, this implant had somewhat anomalous 2-year
data (0.64 mm, 0.45 mm, and 0.87 mm at 1, 2, and 5 years), where the
difference between 1 year and 5 years would make the implant appear
stable (0.23 mm in 4 years) but the difference between 2 years and 5
years would make the implant appear to be continuously migrating (0.42
mm in 3 years). The condition number and mean errors for this subject
were within normal limits. All other implants that were found to be
stable at 2 years migrated less than 0.3 mm between the 2- and 5-year
follow-up, and were still classified as stable. The proportion of "at
risk" components at 5 years was 2 of 18 (0.11, 95% CI: 0.03--0.33) in
the cemented group and was 0 of 27 (95% CI: 0.0--0.13) in the trabecular
metal group (p = 0.2).

At the 5-year follow-up, there was no difference in MTPM between the
cemented group and the trabecular metal group (p = 0.9) ([Table 2](#)
and [Figure 2](#)). MTPM values for individual subjects are shown in
[Figure 3](#). Compared to the cemented components, the trabecular metal
tibial components had more subsidence (p = 0.001) ([Table 2](#)).

At the 2-year follow-up, 9 subjects in the trabecular metal group had
shown very high migration in the first 6 months postoperatively (\> 1.0
mm). All of these implants migrated less than 0.2 mm between 1 and 2
years and were not considered to be "at risk" At 5 years, all of these
implants continued to show stability with an average change in MTPM of
0.10 mm over the 3 years between follow-ups.

Using the marker configuration models, independent bead motion was
detected in 5 of the high-migration cases, between the postoperative and
6-month follow-up examinations. The error of fit of the model marker was
reduced dramatically (0.103 mm to 0.0466 mm on average) when the bead in
question was removed from the analysis. The position of the bead with
respect to that of the bead in the model was inferior, indicating that
the motion was not due to loose beads, which would have traveled
radially. The magnitude of independent bead motion was from 0.3 mm to
0.5 mm in all 5 cases. At the 5-year follow-up, there was no change in
the position of the independently moving bead---indicating that the
deformation of the base plate was permanent.
