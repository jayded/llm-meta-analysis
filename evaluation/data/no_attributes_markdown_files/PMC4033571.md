# Abstract ## Objective To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of once-daily 1200 mg and 2400 mg SPN-804 (Oxtellar XR™, Supernus Pharmaceuticals), an extended-release tablet formulation of oxcarbazepine (OXC), added to 1-3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in adults with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization. ## Methods The Prospective, Randomized Study of OXC XR in Subjects with Partial Epilepsy Refractory (PROSPER) study was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 3 study. The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly (28-day) seizure frequency for the 16-week double-blind treatment period in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with analyzable seizure data. Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50% seizure reduction, proportion of patients seizure free, and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration. ## Results Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, −38.2% (*P *=* *0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and −42.9% (*P *=* *0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg. Responder rates were 28.1%, 36.1% (*P *=* *0.08), and 40.7% (*P *=* *0.02); 16-week seizure-free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3%, 4.9% (*P *=* *0.59), and 11.4% (*P *=* *0.008), respectively. When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters, a *post hoc* analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: −13.3%; 1200 mg: −34.5%, *P *=* *0.02; 2400 mg: −52.7%, *P *=* *0.006) in the North American study site cluster. A concentration--response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg. Adverse event types reflected the drug's established profile. Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate-release OXC. Once-daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals. ## Conclusions Adjunctive once-daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures. Adverse event occurrence and discontinuations due to adverse events suggest improved tolerability vs previously published data with immediate-release OXC. # Results ## Patient disposition and characteristics Of 440 patients screened, 366 patients were randomized to once-daily placebo (*n *=* *121), SPN-804 1200 mg (*n *=* *122), and SPN-804 2400 mg (*n *= 123). Analyzable seizure data for the primary efficacy analysis were available for 96.7% (*n *=* *117), 89.3% (*n *=* *109), and 90.3% (*n *=* *111), respectively (Fig. [1](#)). Of the 111 patients in the 2400-mg group with analyzable seizure data, 26 were patients in whom SPN-804 was down-titrated to 1800 mg/day. Overall, 67.8% of patients completed 16 weeks, with 21.5% of placebo patients discontinuing prematurely compared with 32.8% and 42.3% in the 1200-mg and 2400-mg SPN-804 groups, respectively. The most common reason for study withdrawal was adverse events, accounting for the higher discontinuation rates in the active treatment groups. Based on pill counts, 96.0% (placebo), 93.2% (1200 mg), and 95.1% (2400 mg) of patients were adherent with once-daily dosing. <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Study disposition for patients assigned to placebo or Oxtellar XR (SPN-804).</figcaption> </figure> Treatment groups were generally well balanced in terms of baseline demographics and disease characteristics (Table [1](#)). Overall, the mean age was 38.9 years; 55.2% of patients were women. The mean number of years since epilepsy diagnosis was 20.8 years; median monthly seizure frequency at baseline was 6.5 seizures despite ongoing treatment with two or three concomitant AEDs in 67.2% of patients. ::::table-wrap

One patient assigned to SPN-804 2400 mg was receiving 4 AEDs.:::: ## Efficacy The median percent seizure frequency change over the 16-week double-blind treatment period was −28.7% with placebo vs −38.3% (*P *=* *0.08) for once-daily 1200-mg and −42.9% (*P *=* *0.003) in the 2400-mg group (Fig. [2](#)). The estimated treatment difference favoring SPN-804 over placebo was −10.3% (95% CI: −22.3, 1.2) for 1200-mg and −18.3% (95% CI: −30.4, −5.8) for 2400-mg group. Secondary endpoints generally mirrored the primary efficacy analysis. Responder rates, that is, proportion of patients with ≥50% seizure frequency reduction (Fig. [2](#)), were placebo, 28.1%; 1200 mg, 36.1% (*P *=* *0.08); and 40.7% (*P *=* *0.02) of those receiving 2400 mg. The odds ratio comparing the responder rates was 1.67 (95% CI: 0.95, 2.94) for SPN-804 1200 mg vs placebo and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.13, 3.50) when comparing 2400 mg and placebo. For the prespecified pragmatic ITT analysis of seizure freedom, 3.3% of the placebo group, 4.9% (*P *=* *0.53) in the 1200-mg group, and 11.4% (*P *=* *0.008) in the 2400-mg group were seizure free for the entire 16-week blinded treatment period. <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Oxtellar XR (SPN-804) vs placebo: Median percent reduction from baseline 28-day seizure frequency (A) and responder rate (B) for the 16-week double-blind treatment period in ITT population with analyzable data. *<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.003; **<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.02 vs placebo. ITT, intent-to-treat.</figcaption> </figure> Sensitivity analyses using a completer and a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis did not change the primary statistical outcome that once-daily SPN-804 2400 mg was shown to be significantly superior to placebo, whereas 1200 mg was not. However, in a sensitivity analysis evaluating the potential influence of regional differences in this multinational trial, both SPN-804 dosage groups were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction -- placebo, −13.3%; 1200 mg, −34.5% (*P *=* *0.02); 2400 mg, −52.7% (*P *=* *0.006) among patients (*n *=* *106) participating at North American study sites (Fig. [3](#)). The estimated treatment difference favoring SPN-804 over placebo was −26.1% (95% CI: −47.9, −4.1) for 1200-mg and −35.3% (95% CI: −59.1, −12.5) for 2400-mg group. In contrast, with the substantially higher placebo effect (-33.2%) observed in patients (*n *=* *231) from the Eastern Europe/Russia study site cluster (Fig. [3](#)), neither SPN-804 dosage group was significantly superior to placebo (1200 mg: −38.4%, *P *=* *0.60; 2400 mg: −41.2%, *P *=* *0.13) in this subset. <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Oxtellar XR (SPN-804) vs placebo: Median percent reduction from baseline 28-day seizure frequency in the North American cluster of study sites (A) and Eastern Europe/Russia cluster (B) in the ITT population. *<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.02; **<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.006 vs placebo. ITT, intent-to-treat.</figcaption> </figure> After 16 weeks of double-blind treatment, PGIC score changes were not significantly different for either SPN-804 dosage vs placebo. Mean total QOLIE-31 and subscale scores did not decrease from baseline during SPN-804 or placebo administration in any group. The only significant differences from placebo in QOLIE-31 score changes were significantly smaller increases in the QOLIE-31 subscales of Cognitive Functioning in the 1200-mg and Medication Effects in both SPN-804 groups (*P *<* *0.01 vs placebo). ## Tolerability and safety The overall incidence of adverse events (Table [2](#)) was similar in the placebo (55.4%) and SPN-804 1200-mg groups (56.6%) and was lower than in patients assigned to 2400 mg (69.1%). The incidences of specific adverse events were generally similar for the placebo and SPN-804 1200-mg groups. The most common adverse events were those related to the nervous system, occurring in 31.4% of placebo patients and 38.5% of those receiving 1200 mg, compared with 56.1% in the 2400-mg group. The most frequently reported adverse events -- dizziness, nausea, somnolence, vomiting, headache, and diplopia -- were typically dose related. Treatment-limiting adverse event rates were 8.3% and 14.8% in the placebo and 1200-mg groups, respectively; 30.1% in the 2400-mg group discontinued due to adverse events. In the active treatment groups, adverse events resulting in discontinuation occurred primarily during the forced-titration phase (1200 mg: 13/20, 65%; 2400 mg: 26/37, 70%). The fact that 23 patients were down-titrated to 1800 mg also suggests some difficulty with tolerability at 2400 mg. ::::table-wrap

*N*, total number of patients; *n*, number of patients.:::: Serious adverse events occurred in seven patients each in the placebo (5.8%) and SPN-804 1200-mg (5.7%) groups and in 10 (8.1%) in the 2400-mg group. Of the adverse events classified as serious, none were considered study drug-related in the SPN-804 1200-mg group and three were considered study drug-related in the placebo group (one subject each with erythematous rash, Stevens--Johnson syndrome, or dizziness). A fourth patient assigned to the placebo group was the only death in the study (death due to ovarian cancer diagnosed 2 days before randomization). Serious adverse events were considered study drug-related in six patients receiving SPN-804 2400 mg -- symptomatic hyponatremia (*n *=* *1), generalized rash (*n *=* *1), dizziness (*n *=* *1), vomiting (*n *=* *1), and general drug intolerance (*n *=* *2), which was characterized by other non-serious adverse events such as dizziness, diplopia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or headache. Study drug was discontinued in all patients with serious adverse events, although SPN-804 was initially down-titrated in one patient before being discontinued due to vertigo/dizziness. Only one clinically significant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG abnormality was observed during the study. A shift from normal to lower serum sodium levels was observed in a relatively small subset of patients receiving active treatment (placebo, 1.7%; 1200 mg, 9.8%; 2400 mg, 6.5%). Serum sodium levels were < 130 mEq/l at any point during double-blind treatment in nine patients receiving SPN-804 (1200 mg, *n *=* *4; 2400 mg, *n *=* *5) and < 125 mEq/l in two patients (one in each SPN-804 group). One occurrence of a markedly abnormal sodium value resulted in symptomatic hyponatremia and was classified as a serious adverse event. ## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics Based on population PK analysis of plasma MHD concentrations, the mean (SD) C~max~ of MHD was 17.9 (5.3) μg/ml in patients receiving once-daily SPN-804 1200-mg and 27.1 (8.7) μg/ml in the 2400-mg group; C~min~ concentrations were 12.0 (4.3) μg/ml and 19.4 (7.8) μg/ml, respectively. Clearance was increased 31% in patients receiving carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate as concomitant therapy, but was not increased further when more than one of these agents was given as co-therapy. In a concentration--response analysis, patients receiving SPN-804 were grouped according to estimated trough (C~min~) MHD concentrations. The breakpoint between subgroups (10 μg/ml) was determined by a sensitivity analysis. The overall median C~min~ across SPN-804 groups was 13.9 μg/ml. Median percent seizure frequency reduction was significantly greater in the subgroup with C~min~ ≥10 μg/ml MHD (*n *=* *125, −50%, *P *=* *0.02) compared with the <10 μg/ml subgroup (*n *=* *41, −35.2%) or the placebo group (*n = *117*,* −28.7%, *P *=* *0.0004); the difference in median percent change for <10 μg/ml subgroup vs placebo was not significant (*P *=* *0.57). The C~min~ was ≥ 10 μg/ml in approximately 85% of patients in the SPN-804 2400-mg group and 66% in the 1200-mg group.
