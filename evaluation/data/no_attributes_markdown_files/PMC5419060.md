# Abstract ## Background There is an increasing amount of blood sample rejection at primary health care facilities (PHCFs), impacting negatively the staff, facility, patient and laboratory costs. ## Aim The primary objective was to determine the rejection rate and reasons for blood sample rejection at four PHCFs before and after a phlebotomy training programme. The secondary objective was to determine whether phlebotomy training improved knowledge among primary health care providers (HCPs) and to develop a tool for blood sample acceptability. ## Study setting Two community health centres (CHCs) and two community day centres (CDCs) in Cape Town. ## Methods A quasi-experimental study design (before and after a phlebotomy training programme). ## Results The sample rejection rate was 0.79% (*n* = 60) at CHC A, 1.13% (*n* = 45) at CHC B, 1.64% (*n* = 38) at CDC C and 1.36% (*n* = 8) at CDC D pre-training. The rejection rate remained approximately the same post-training (*p* > 0.05). The same phlebotomy questionnaire was administered pre- and post-training to HCPs. The average score increased from 63% (95% CI 6.97‒17.03) to 96% (95% CI 16.91‒20.09) at CHC A (*p =* 0.039), 58% (95% CI 9.09‒14.91) to 93% (95% CI 17.64‒18.76) at CHC B (*p* = 0.006), 60% (95% CI 8.84‒13.13) to 97% (95% CI 16.14‒19.29) at CDC C (*p =* 0.001) and 63% (95% CI 9.81‒13.33) to 97% (95% CI 18.08‒19.07) at CDC D (*p* = 0.001). ## Conclusion There is no statistically significant improvement in the rejection rate of blood samples (*p* > 0.05) post-training despite knowledge improving in all HCPs (*p* < 0.05). # Results Approximately 6--10 HCPs participated at these different sites. There were 23 study participants ([Table 1](#)) who attended the phlebotomy training session across all the facilities. The age, sex and level of phlebotomy experience of each HCP who attended the training were recorded. There were no exclusion criteria for the above variables of age, sex and level of experience. Most of the HCPs were aged between 30 and 50 years. There was only 1 male participant and 22 females. There were 3 student nurses, 17 nurses and only 3 doctors. The phlebotomy experience across participants varied, with nine participants having less than 5 years' experience, five having 5--10 years' experience and nine having more than 30 years' experience. ::::table-wrap

Technique-related errors include samples that were clotted or haemolysed. Knowledge related errors include errors because of incorrect blood volume or the incorrect blood sample tube used. Request form errors include any error in the completion of the request form such as no patient details indicated, illegible requests, name on sample tube and request form unmatched, no test requested or an unlabelled sample. Unaccountable preanalytical errors include all errors that are not accounted for by the above but that occur in the preanalytical phase of laboratory testing of blood samples. These include samples with missing reasons for rejection, samples older than 3 days, samples that leaked in transit as well as samples that were not received by the laboratory. [Table 3](#) shows a detailed summary of rejection rates and related reasons by facility. At CHC A, many samples were rejected because of clotting, 20 (0.26%) were rejected pre-training and 16 (0.16%) post-training ([Table 3](#)). Request form errors improved post-training from 11 (0.15%) pre-training to 8 (0.08%) post-training. There was an increase in the rejection rate of samples because of unaccountable preanalytical errors, 17 (0.22%) pre-training to 27 (0.26%) post-training ([Figure 1](#)). <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>The rejection rate at CHC A.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap

The average score increased from 63% (95% CI 6.97‒17.03) to 96% (95% CI 16.91‒20.09) at CHC A (*p* = 0.039), 58% (95% CI 9.09‒14.91) to 93% (95% CI 17.64‒18.76) at CHC B (*p* = 0.006), 60% (95% CI 8.84‒13.13) to 97% (95% CI 16.14‒19.29) at CDC C (*p* = 0.001) and 63% (95% CI 9.81‒13.33) to 97% (95% CI 18.08 -- 19.07) at CDC D (*p =* 0.001). Participants were asked to grade their level of confidence in phlebotomy on a Likert scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being 'not confident at all' and 6 being 'very confident'. All participants' level of confidence either remained the same or increased post-phlebotomy training ([Figure 5](#)). <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Level of confidence in phlebotomy across all clinics pre- and post-training using a Likert Scale.</figcaption> </figure> # Ethical consideration This study has been approved by the Health Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the University of Cape Town (HREC REF: 549/2013) as well as by the Provincial Government of the Western Cape (REF: 2013RP190).
