# Abstract ## Background: Cognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), with cognitive processing speed being the most frequently affected domain. ## Objective: Examine the effects of daclizumab beta versus intramuscular (IM) interferon (IFN) beta-1a on cognitive processing speed as assessed by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). ## Methods: In DECIDE, patients with relapsing--remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) (age: 18--55 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 0--5.0) were randomized to daclizumab beta ( *n* = 919) or IM IFN beta-1a ( *n* = 922) for 96--144 weeks. SDMT was administered at baseline and at 24-week intervals. ## Results: At week 96, significantly greater mean improvement from baseline in SDMT was observed with daclizumab beta versus IM IFN beta-1a ( *p* = 0.0274). Significantly more patients treated with daclizumab beta showed clinically meaningful improvement in SDMT (increase from baseline of ⩾3 points ( *p* = 0.0153) or ⩾4 points ( *p* = 0.0366)), and significantly fewer patients showed clinically meaningful worsening (decrease from baseline of ⩾3 points ( *p* = 0.0103)). Odds representing risk of worsening versus stability or improvement on SDMT were significantly smaller for daclizumab beta ( *p* = 0.0088 (3-point threshold); *p* = 0.0267 (4-point threshold)). In patients completing 144 weeks of treatment, the effects of daclizumab beta were generally sustained. ## Conclusion: These results provide evidence for a benefit of daclizumab beta versus IM IFN beta-1a on cognitive processing speed in RRMS. ## Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01064401 (Efficacy and Safety of BIIB019 (Daclizumab High Yield Process) Versus Interferon β 1a in Participants With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DECIDE)): [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01064401](#) . # Results ## Descriptive data A total of 1841 patients were randomized (daclizumab beta, *n* = 919; IM IFN beta-1a, *n* = 922). All were included in the ITT population. Demographic and baseline MS disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups, as reported previously. ^[18](#)^At baseline, in the daclizumab beta and IM IFN beta-1a groups, mean (SD) SDMT score was 48.5 (15.9) and 47.7 (16.1), respectively, and median (range) SDMT score was 49 (0--110) and 49 (3--110), respectively. ## Group effects on SDMT Based on the linear mixed model analysis approach, there was a significant group × time interaction ( *p* = 0.0004). Significantly greater mean improvement from baseline in SDMT scores was observed with daclizumab beta compared with IM IFN beta-1a at week 96 (mean (SD) change from baseline: 4.1 (12.4) vs 2.9 (12.7); *p* = 0.0274), as reported previously ( [Figure 1](#) ). ^[18](#)^This effect was sustained at week 144 (6.3 (12.6) vs 3.1 (13.2); *p* = 0.0024) in a limited number of patients completing 144 weeks of treatment with available SDMT scores (daclizumab beta, *n* = 287; IM IFN beta-1a, *n* = 277). <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Mean change from baseline in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score at weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, and 144.
