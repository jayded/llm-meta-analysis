# Abstract Hepatitis C virus genotype 2 (HCV-2) slow responders poorly respond to 24 weeks of peginterferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). We evaluated the efficacy of extended 48-week regimen and the role of interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype in this clinical setting. Treatment-naïve HCV-2 patients not achieving rapid virologic response (RVR) by Peg-IFN alfa-2a 180 μg/week plus weight-based RBV (1,000--1,200 mg/day, cutoff body weight of 75 kg) were randomly assigned to receive a total duration of 48 (n = 94) or 24 (n = 93) weeks of therapy. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR). Baseline patient characteristics to predict SVR were analyzed. Patients receiving 48 weeks of treatment had a greater SVR rate than those receiving 24 weeks of treatment (70.2% versus 46.2%, *P* = 0.001). Compared to patients treated for 24 weeks, the SVR rate in those treated for 48 weeks increased by 10.9% [95% CI: −5.9% to 27.7%] and 65.6% [95% CI: 44.5% to 86.7%] if they had IL-28B rs8099917 TT genotype, and GT/GG genotype, respectively (interaction *P* = 0.002). In conclusion, 48-week treatment with Peg-IFN plus weight-based RBV provides a greater SVR rate than 24-week treatment in treatment-naïve HCV-2 patients with unfavorable IL-28B genotypes who fail to achieve RVR. # Results ## Patient Characteristics Among the 190 patients not achieving RVR by Peg-IFN plus weight-based RBV therapy, 187 were allocated to a total duration of 48-week (n = 94) or 24-week (n = 93) therapy. Seventy-four (78.7%) and 80 (86.0%) patients assigned to 48-week and 24-week therapies completed treatment, and 87 (92.6%) and 88 (94.6%) patients completed 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up to assess the SVR rates ([Fig. 1](#)). The baseline patient characteristics were comparable between the two arms ([Table 1](#)).They were slim with an average BMI of 26.3--26.7 kg/m^2^.Most of the patients had high baseline viral load (62--65%) and favorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotype (71--74%), and were infected with 2a subtype (68--71%). With regard to aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score, 23.7--27.7% patients had a score of >2.00. ## Efficacy The early virologic response (EVR) (91.5% versus 88.2%, RD: 3.3% [95% CI: −5.3% to 12.0%]; *P* = 0.45) and the end-of-treatment virologic response (ETVR) (88.3% versus 80.6%, RD: 7.7% [95% CI: −2.7% to 18.0%]; *P* = 0.15) rates were comparable between the treatment arms. The SVR rate of 48-week treatment was greater than 24-week treatment (70.2% versus 46.2%, RD: 24.0% [95% CI: 10.3% to 37.7%]; *P* = 0.001) ([Table 2](#)). Patients with RBV cumulative exposure <60% had lower SVR rates than those with RBV cumulative exposure ≥60% in 48-week arm (77.6% versus 38.9%, *P *= 0.003) and 24-week arm (53.8% versus 6.7%, *P *= 0.001), respectively. ## Subgroup Analyses for Prespecified Factors Differences of SVR rates between patients receiving 48 and 24 weeks of treatment did not vary by baseline viral load (interaction *P* = 0.82), subgenotype (interaction *P* = 0.89), age (interaction *P* = 0.73), sex (interaction *P* = 0.94), body mass index (BMI) (interaction *P* = 0.26), APRI score (interaction *P* = 0.83) or RBV cumulative exposure (interaction *P *= 0.48) ([Table 3](#)). Compared to patients with favorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotype (69.2% versus 58.3%, risk difference (RD): 10.9% [95% CI: −5.9% to 27.7%]), patients with unfavorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotypes receiving 48-week therapy achieved a greater SVR rate than 24-week therapy (73.9% versus 8.3%, RD: 65.6% [95% CI: 44.5% to 86.7%]; interaction *P* = 0.002). The SVR rates of 48-week and 24-week treatment were similar when the patients had BMI >30 kg/m^2^ (52.6% versus 50.0%, RD: 2.6% [95% CI: −33.5% to 38.8%]). ## Safety The constitutional and laboratory adverse events (AEs) were similar between the two arms ([Table 4](#)). Four and 3 patients in 48-week and 24-week arms had serious AEs during treatment (4.3% versus 3.2%, RD: 1.1% [95% CI: −4.4% to 6.5%]. The AE-related withdrawal rates were 11.7% in 48-week treatment arm and 6.5% in 24-week treatment arm (RD: 5.2% [95% CI: 2.9% to 13.5%]). The rates of anemia beyond week 6 of treatment were 44.7% and 34.4% (RD: 10.3% [95% CI: −3.7% to 24.2%]. <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Study Flow Diagram.

AE: adverse event, ALT: alanine aminotransferase, ULN: upper limit of
normal.

^*^Values are numbers (percentages).

^†^SD48W arm: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis at week 36 of treatment,
cellulitis at week 20 of treatment, severe anemia with postural
dizziness at week 12 of treatment (hemoglobin level: 7.1 g/dL), and
multiple myeloma at week 40 of treatment. SD24W arm: urinary tract
infection at week 12 of treatment, community-acquired pneumonia at week
16 of treatment, severe anemia with postural dizziness at week 16 of
treatment (hemoglobin level: 7.3 g/dL), respectively. All except the
patients developing multiple myeloma were considered treatment-related.

^‡^The grading of the laboratory AEs was shown for patients with the
on-treatment nadir level.

^§^Anemia was defined as a nadir hemoglobin level <10.0 g/dL.

^¶^No patient with total bilirubin elevation had concomitant ALT
elevation >5 times ULN.::::
