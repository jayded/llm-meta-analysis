# Abstract ## Background Preemptive analgesia is the blocking of pain perception afferent pathways before noxious painful stimuli. Clonidine is an alpha agonist drug that is partially selective for α-2 adrenoreceptors. Clonidine is used as anti-anxiety medication and an, analgesic, and it prolongs the duration of the block in the brachial plexus block. ## Objectives To compare the effect of preemptive clonidine with midazolam on intraoperative sedation, duration of block, and postoperative pain scores**.** ## Patients and Methods In a randomized clinical trial, 80 patients with orthopedic fractures of an upper extremity who underwent supraclavicular nerve block were randomly assigned to receive 0.2 mg oral clonidine or 2 mg oral midazolam. Intraoperative sedation was measured at one hour after the start of urgery and again in the PACU (Post-Anesthesia Care Unit) using the Ramsay scale. The duration of sensory blockade was measured. Postoperative pain scores were measured using the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) after entrance to recovery up to 2 hours. ## Results The percentages of patients in the calm and sedated scale were significantly higher in clonidine group (35 and 42.5%, respectively), compared to the midazolam group (17.5 and 17.5%, respectively) (P = 0.042, 0.029; respectively). Those administered fentanyl in the clonidine group 105 ± 30.8 was significantly lower than that for the midazolam group 165 ± 34.5 (P = 0.0018). The percentages of patients in the calm scale were significantly higher in the clonidine group (52.5), compared to the midazolam group (17.5) (P = 0.001) in the post-operative period. VAS scores were significantly lower at one (P = 0.01) and two hours (P = 0.001) after operation in the clonidine group, compared to the midazolam group. ## Conclusions Preemptive clonidine has many marvelous advantages over midazolam, including better sedation inside the operating room and then in the post-operative care unit, lower fentanyl doses are required during surgery, more stable heart rate and blood pressure are observed during the procedure, and patients report lower post-operative pain scores. # 4. Results In a randomized clinical, trial 80 patients enrolled in the study, 40 in the clonidine group and 40 in the midazolam group. All demographic variables, including age, gender, and BMI (body mass index) were not significantly different between the clonidine and midazolam groups ([Table 1](#)). ::::table-wrap

^a^Data are expressed as No. (%) or mean ± SD:::: Patients' sedation scales, as measured by the Ramsay sedation scale, were compared during surgery (right 60 minutes after the initiation of surgery). Patients in the clonidine group had significantly better sedation scale ratings than the other group. The percentages of patients in the calm and sedated scale were significantly higher in the clonidine group (35 and 42.5%, respectively), compared to the midazolam group (17.5 and 17.5%, respectively) (P = 0.042, 0.029; respectively). In addition, the percentages of patients in the agitated and heavily sedated group were significantly higher in the midazolam group, compared to this in the clonidine group (P = 0.002 and 0.014; respectively) ([Figure 1](#)). <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Comparison of Sedation Scale at 60 Minutes After the Start of Surgery in the Clonidine and Midazolam Groups</figcaption> </figure> Total intraoperative fentanyl requirements were compared between the two groups of the study.
