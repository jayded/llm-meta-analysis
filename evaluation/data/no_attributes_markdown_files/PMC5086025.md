Abstract

## OBJECTIVE

After intensive insulin treatment, many obese African American patients
with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hyperglycemia are
able to achieve near-normoglycemia remission. The optimal treatment to
prevent hyperglycemic relapses after remission is not known.

## RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This prospective, 4-year, placebo-controlled study randomly assigned 48
African American subjects with DKA and severe hyperglycemia to metformin
1,000 mg daily (*n* = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg daily (*n* = 16), or
placebo (*n* = 15) after normoglycemia remission. Hyperglycemic relapse
was defined as fasting glucose \>130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and HbA~1c~
\>7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at
randomization and at 3 months and then every 6 months for a median of
331 days. Oral minimal model and incremental area under the curve for
insulin (AUCi) were used to calculate insulin sensitivity (Si) and
β-cell function, respectively. Disposition index (DI) was calculated as
a product of Si and incremental AUCi.

## RESULTS

Relapse-free survival was higher in sitagliptin and metformin (*P* =
0.015) compared with placebo, and mean time to relapse was significantly
prolonged in the metformin and sitagliptin groups compared with the
placebo group (480 vs. 305 days, *P* = 0.004). The probability of
relapse was significantly lower for metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 \[95%
CI 0.10--0.81\]) and sitagliptin (0.31 \[0.10--0.98\]) than for placebo.
Subjects who remained in remission had a higher DI (*P* = 0.02) and
incremental AUCi (*P* \< 0.001) than those with hyperglycemia relapse
without significant changes in Si.

## CONCLUSIONS

This study shows that near-normoglycemia remission was similarly
prolonged by treatment with sitagliptin and metformin. The prolongation
of remission was due to improvement in β-cell function.

# Results

Forty-eight African American subjects with DKA (*n* = 22) and severe
hyperglycemia (*n* = 26) were included in the study. Seventeen subjects
were randomly assigned to metformin 1,000 mg daily, 16 to sitagliptin
100 mg daily, and 15 to placebo. Four subjects in the metformin group, 6
in the sitagliptin group, and 1 in the placebo group were lost to
follow-up. One subject in the sitagliptin group and one subject in the
placebo group withdrew from the study. The overall median follow-up
after insulin discontinuation was 331 days (interquartile range 102, 612
days) with no differences between randomized groups ([Table 1](#)). The
subjects lost to follow-up or who withdrew from the study were in
near-normoglycemia remission during their last documented study visit.
There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics at
presentation between subjects who withdrew and those who stayed in the
study, except for HbA~1c~. HbA~1c~ was lower at presentation of
DKA/hyperglycemia in subjects who withdrew compared with those who
stayed (12.0 ± 2.3% \[107 ± 25 mmol/mol\] vs. 13.5 ± 2.0% \[124 ± 22
mmol/mol\], *P* = 0.03) but was similar at randomization.

At presentation of DKA and severe hyperglycemia, there were no
differences in age and BMI among the metformin, sitagliptin, or placebo
groups ([Table 1](#)). Although not statistically significant, both the
sitagliptin and metformin groups had more men than women, whereas the
placebo group had similar proportions of men and women. In the
proportion of subjects with DKA or severe hyperglycemia, length and dose
of insulin use before randomization (time to near-normoglycemia
remission) did not differ between groups. At randomization, there were
no significant changes in weight or differences in fasting glucose or
HbA~1c~ levels. At the end of the study, there was a significant
difference in HbA~1c~ (*P* = 0.04) between the groups ([Table 1](#)). In
the patients who remained in near-normoglycemia remission, there was a
significant difference in fasting glucose at the end of the study
([Table 1](#)). There were no differences at diagnosis of diabetes in
the subjects who remained in near-normoglycemia remission compared with
those with hyperglycemia relapse at presentation ([Table 2](#)). At
randomization, fasting glucose levels were higher in subjects who
experienced hyperglycemia relapse than in those who remained in
remission ([Table 2](#)). At the end of the study, fasting glucose and
HbA~1c~ levels were higher in the subjects who experienced hyperglycemia
relapse ([Table 2](#)).

†Missing GAD antibody levels for one subject in the near-normoglycemia
remission group and two subjects in the hyperglycemia relapse group.
::::

Hyperglycemia relapse-free survival was significantly higher in the
metformin and sitagliptin groups than in the placebo group (*P* = 0.015)
([Fig. 1](#)). The 2-year failure rate was higher in the placebo than in
the sitagliptin (77% vs. 44%, *P* = 0.113) or metformin (77% vs. 34%,
*P* = 0.013) groups. Compared with placebo, patients randomized to
metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 \[95% CI 0.10--0.814\]) and sitagliptin
(0.31 \[0.10--0.98\]) were ∼70% less likely to have a hyperglycemia
relapse. However, there was no difference in hyperglycemia relapse-free
survival between metformin and sitagliptin (*P* = 0.75) ([Fig. 1](#)).
The restricted mean time to hyperglycemia relapse in the combined
metformin and sitagliptin groups was significantly higher than placebo
(480 vs. 305 days, *P* = 0.004).

the sitagliptin and metformin groups (<em>P</em> = 0.75).</figcaption>
</figure>

We also assessed whether being on medication decreased the severity of
hyperglycemia relapse. Because only a small number of subjects
experienced relapse in the medication groups (metformin \[*n* = 5\],
sitagliptin \[*n* = 4\]) compared with placebo (*n* = 11), we combined
the metformin and sitagliptin groups. There were no significant
differences in HbA~1c~ (8.0 ± 0.8% \[64 ± 9 mmol/mol\] vs. 8.2 ± 1.5%
\[66 ± 16 mmol/mol\], *P* = 0.79) or blood glucose (152 ± 18 mg/dL \[8.4
± 1 mmol/L\] vs. 160 ± 68 mg/dL \[8.9 ± 3.8 mmol/L\], *P* = 0.65) levels
at the time of hyperglycemia relapse between the placebo group and the
combined metformin and sitagliptin group. In the placebo group, 3 of the
11 subjects who experienced hyperglycemia relapse presented to the
emergency department with a glucose level \>400 mg/dL (22.2 mmol/mol) or
DKA. None of the patients in the metformin and sitagliptin group had a
hyperglycemia relapse necessitating a visit to the emergency department
or admission to the hospital.

The difference in hyperglycemia relapse was explained by improvements in
β-cell function. Over the course of the study, DI (*P* = 0.02) and
incremental AUCi (*P* \< 0.001) were significantly higher in subjects
who remained in near-normoglycemia remission compared with those who had
a hyperglycemia relapse without any differences in Si (*P* = 0.75).
There was a significant interaction between remission status and study
visit for both Si (*P* = 0.01) and DI (*P* = 0.02), suggesting a
different pattern of change in Si and DI over time between subjects with
near-normoglycemia remission and hyperglycemia relapse. The difference
in DI and incremental AUCi was not present at randomization in the
subjects who stayed in near-normoglycemia remission compared with those
who experienced a hyperglycemia relapse ([Fig. 2*A* and *B*](#)). At the
last documented follow-up, there were no differences in Si ([Fig.
2*C*](#)); however, DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* \< 0.001)
were significantly higher in subjects who stayed in near-normoglycemia
remission than in those who had a hyperglycemia relapse at the end of
the study ([Fig. 2*A* and *B*](#)). Comparison across treatment groups
showed no differences at randomization, over the course of the study, or
at the last follow-up for DI, incremental AUCi, or Si (data not shown).
Similarly, a comparison of subjects with an initial presentation of DKA
and severe hyperglycemia showed no differences in Si, incremental AUCi,
or DI at randomization, over the course of the study, or at the last
follow-up (data not shown). Although there were no significant changes
in weight, we performed analyses adjusting for changes in weight
throughout the course of the study. No differences were found in Si,
incremental AUCi, or DI compared with unadjusted analyses.

remained in remission had higher DI and incremental AUCi than those who
had a relapse (<em>ABackgroundMiddle-aged women are at risk of weight
gain and associated comorbidities. Deliberate restriction of food intake
(dieting) produces short-term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful
for long-term weight management. Two promising approaches for the
prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating (ie, eating in accordance
with hunger and satiety signals) and the development of greater
psychological flexibility (ie, the aim of acceptance and commitment
therapy [ACT]).ObjectivesThis pilot study investigated the usage,
acceptability, and feasibility of “Mind, Body, Food,” a Web-based weight
gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and
psychological flexibility skills.MethodsParticipants were 40 overweight
women (mean age 44.8 [standard deviation, SD, 3.06] years, mean body
mass index [BMI] 32.9 [SD 6.01] kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean Intuitive Eating
Scale [IES-1] total score 53.4 [SD 7.46], classified as below average)
who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin, New Zealand.
Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google
Analytics. Use of an online self-monitoring tool was determined by
entries saved to a secure online database. Intervention acceptability
was assessed postintervention. BMI, intuitive eating, binge eating,
psychological flexibility, and general mental and physical health were
assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months
postintervention.ResultsOf the 40 women enrolled in the study, 12 (30%)
completed all 12 modules (median 7.5 [interquartile range, IQR, 2-12]
modules) and 4 (10%) used the self-monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of
the intervention period (median 3 [IQR 1-9] weeks). Among 26 women who
completed postintervention assessments, most women rated “Mind, Body,
Food” as useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%) and liked the
intervention (22/25, 88%). From pre- to postintervention, there were
statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating
(IES-2 total score <em>P</em>&lt;.001; all IES-2 subscale scores:
<em>P</em> ≤.01), psychological flexibility (<em>P</em>=.01), and
general mental health (<em>P</em>&lt;.001) as well as significant
decreases in binge eating (<em>P</em>=.01). At the 3-month follow-up,
IES-2 improvements were maintained, and there were further improvements
in binge eating (<em>P</em>&lt;.001) and general mental health
(<em>P</em>=.03), and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further
improvement in psychological flexibility (<em>P</em>=.06). There were no
significant within-group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention
and postintervention to 3-month follow-up (<em>P</em>=.46 and
<em>P</em>=.93, respectively).ConclusionsThe “Mind, Body, Food”
prototype Web-based intervention is appealing to middle-aged women and
may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT
skills, reduce binge eating, and maintain weight over 3 months. Further
work to improve the user experience and engagement is required before
testing the online intervention in a randomized controlled
trial.ResultsRecruitment and RetentionDuring recruitment, of the 97
women who expressed interest in the study, 75 women met preliminary
screening criteria and subsequently were invited to complete the online
eligibility assessment. Five women did not complete the online
eligibility assessment, and only 45 women met the study inclusion
criteria (see <a href="#">Figure 6</a> for reasons women were excluded).
A total of 40 women were enrolled in the study from August to September
2014. The postintervention retention rate was 65% (26/40) and 63%
(25/40) at the 3-month follow-up. Although the attrition rate was
similar to that predicted (30%), the sample size at follow-up was lower
than had been aimed for due to the number of women not meeting
eligibility criteria. <a href="#">Figure 6</a> presents the flow of
participants through the study.Figure 6"Mind, Body, Food" study

presents the sample’s demographic characteristics at baseline in
comparison with corresponding NZ Census data. The sample was
overrepresentative of NZ European women (30/37, 81.1% vs 69.8%) but
similarly representative of Māori (4/37, 10.8% vs 11.7%) and Pacific
(1/37, 2.7% vs 4.4%) women. University-educated women were
overrepresented (21/37, 56.8% vs 17.7%). Women with NZSEI-06 (estimating
socioeconomic status) scores in the lower two quartiles were
underrepresented (10-33: 2/37, 5.4% vs 23.1%, 34-44: 3/37, 8.1% vs
29.4%). Half (18/36, 50.0%) of women reported dieting for 20 years or
longer. There were no statistically significant differences in
demographic characteristics or other measures such as intuitive eating,
binge eating, general mental health, psychological inflexibility, and
BMI between women who were retained and not retained at 3-month
follow-up. Table 2Baseline characteristics of “Mind, Body, Food”

14-week InterventionGoogle Analytics recorded “Mind, Body, Food” online
traffic for 37 participants for 92 days at the end of the 14-week trial.
A programming delay prevented monitoring from the start of the study,
which explains missing usage data for three women. Of the 37
participants for whom usage data were available, 12 (32%) completed all
12 modules, 11 (30%) completed 7 to 11 modules, 12 (32%) completed 1 to
6 modules, and two women (5%) completed no modules. The median number of
modules completed was 7.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-12) modules. The
median number of sessions during the monitored period was 7 (a minimum
of 1 session to a maximum of 66 sessions). The median session duration
during the monitored period was 12 minutes, 54 seconds (a minimum of 3
minutes, 58 seconds, to a maximum of 100 minutes, 8 seconds). The median
number of EAT entries over the 14-week intervention was 7 (a minimum of
1 entry to a maximum of 314 entries). The median number of weeks that
participants recorded eating experiences in the EAT was 3 (IQR 1-9)
weeks. Of the 40 participants enrolled in the study, 4 women (10%) used
the EAT for at least 12 weeks of their intervention period, 7 (18%) used
the EAT for 7 to 11 weeks, 20 (50%) used the EAT for 1 to 6 weeks, and 9
(23%) did not use the EAT during their intervention period.Eleven women
had limited access to “Mind, Body, Food” for more than 5 days,
predominantly due to being away from home (n=8) or technical issues
(n=3). Technical issues that prevented module completion included
attempting to access “Mind, Body, Food” from an incompatible browser
(n=3), using incorrect login details (n=1), and other issues not
described (n=1). Seven women reported appetite being affected for more
than 5 days (eg, due to illness) during the 14-week
intervention.AcceptabilityA total of 26 women completed acceptability
measures, and of these 12 had completed all modules, 10 completed 7 to
11 modules, and 4 completed 2 to 6 modules. <a href="#">Table 3</a>
shows that participants’ overall impression of “Mind, Body, Food” was
positive. Most participants liked “Mind, Body, Food” and found the
intervention useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%), easy to
understand (23/25, 92%), and would recommend the program to others
(21/25, 84%). Nearly half (12/25, 48%) of participants reported that
“Mind, Body, Food” made it easy to learn intuitive eating skills.Of all
module components, the videos were more frequently rated as being quite
or extremely useful by participants compared to the audio and typed
activities (<a href="#">Table 3</a>). Five out of 24 women (21%) women
rated the EAT self-monitoring tool as quite or extremely useful, 3 out
of 19 women (16%) found email reminders to use the EAT useful, and 4 out
of 12 women (33%) found SMS reminders to use the EAT useful (not shown).
In regards to reminders sent to begin the next module, 17 out of 26
women (68%) rated the email reminders as quite or extremely useful. Of
the women (9/24, 38%) who chose to receive SMS reminders to begin the
next module, 6 (67%) rated the reminders as useful (not shown).Of the 20
women who currently owned a smartphone, 16 (80%) reported that if it
were available a mobile version of “Mind, Body, Food” would be quite or
extremely useful to them.Table 3User experiences of “Mind, Body, Food”

Changes in Eating BehaviorThe study was not designed to detect the
effects of the intervention on the outcome measures (no control group
was included), but within-group comparisons were performed as part of
the feasibility component of the pilot study. From pre- to
postintervention, there were statistically significant increases in
IES-2 total scores and all four IES-2 subscale scores (<a href="#">Table
4</a>). There was no evidence that these improvements diminished at the
3-month follow-up. Based on use of the dichotomous variable (ie, binge
eating vs no binge eating), 7 out of 14 women who reported eating a
significantly large amount of food (ie, binge eating) at the
preintervention assessment reported no binge eating at the
postintervention assessment. There were no women who transitioned from
no binge eating at the preintervention assessment to binge eating at the
postintervention assessment or at the 3-month follow-up; 4 women who
reported binge eating at postintervention no longer reported binge
eating at the 3-month follow-up. McNemar’s test revealed a significant
decrease in the proportion of women binge eating from the pre- to
postintervention visits (<em>P</em>=.01) and a significant decrease from
postintervention to follow-up (<em>P</em>&lt;.001). The median days
women who were categorized as binge eaters reported binge eating at
preintervention was 4.25 (IQR 2.5-10) days, at postintervention was 4
(IQR 2-8) days, and at the 3-month follow-up it was 2 (IQR 2-4) days. A
Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to examine changes in
the reported number of days women were unable to prevent or stop
episodes of eating an unusually large amount of food and revealed a
significant decrease from pre- to postintervention (<em>P</em>=.03) and
no evidence of a change from postintervention to follow-up
(<em>P</em>=.57).Psychological Inflexibility, Quality of Life, and
BMIPsychological inflexibility decreased significantly from pre- to
postintervention (mean change −4.23 [SD 7.13], <em>P</em>=.006), and
there was a tendency for a further decrease in psychological
inflexibility from postintervention to 3-month-follow-up (mean change
−2.60 [SD 6.58], <em>P</em>=.06) (<a href="#">Table 4</a>). There were
no significant changes in general physical health from pre- to
postintervention (pre- to postintervention PCS scores: mean change 0.29
[SD 9.35], <em>P</em>=.88; postintervention to 3-month follow-up PCS
scores: mean change 1.26 [SD 10.46], <em>P</em>=.55). However, general
mental health improved significantly from pre- to postintervention with
a further improvement postintervention to 3-month follow-up (mean change
5.07 [SD 6.31], <em>P</em>&lt;.001; mean change 3.45 [SD 7.71],
<em>P</em>=.03, respectively). There were no statistically significant
changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention or postintervention to
3-month follow-up (mean change −0.13 [SD 0.88], <em>P</em>=.46 and mean
change −0.01 [SD 0.57], <em>P</em>=.93, respectively).Associations
Between Changes in Intuitive Eating With BMI and Psychological
InflexibilitySpearman correlations showed a statistically significant
inverse relationship between pre- to postintervention change in total
intuitive eating scores and pre- to postintervention change in BMI
(<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.43, <em>P</em>=.03). Thus, greater decreases
in BMI were associated with greater increases in intuitive eating.
However, when relationships with individual subscales were examined, a
significant association was found for only one subscale: greater
decreases in BMI were associated with greater increases in eating for
physical rather than emotional reasons (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.56,
<em>P</em>=.003). There was also a statistically significant inverse
relationship between change in psychological inflexibility scores and
change in intuitive eating scores (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.52,
<em>P</em>=.006); that is, greater improvements in psychological
flexibility were associated with greater increases in total intuitive
eating scores. Furthermore, larger improvements in psychological
flexibility were associated with greater increases in two subscale
scores: eating for physical rather than emotional reasons
(<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.41, <em>P</em>=.04) and reliance on hunger and
satiety cues (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.62, <em>P</em>&lt;.001). A
greater reduction in psychological inflexibility scores was also
associated with a greater decrease in BMI (<em>r</em>=.41,
<em>P</em>=.04).Table 4Changes from pre- (n=26) to postintervention
