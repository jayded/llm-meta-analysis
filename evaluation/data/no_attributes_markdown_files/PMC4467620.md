Abstract

## Background

Heat stress potentially has detrimental effects on brain function.
Hence, cognitive function may be impaired during physical activity in a
hot environment. Skin cooling is often applied in a hot environment to
counteract heat stress. However, it is unclear to what extent neck
cooling is effective for cognitive impairment during exercise in a hot
environment. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of
temporal neck cooling on cognitive function during strenuous exercise in
a hot environment.

## Methods

Eight male young participants (mean ± SD, age = 26.1 ± 3.2 years; peak
oxygen uptake = 45.6 ± 5.2 ml/kg/min) performed Spatial delayed response
(DR) task (working memory) and Go/No-Go task (executive function) at
rest and during exercise in the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions. After
the participants completed the cognitive tasks at rest, they cycled the
ergometer until their heart rate (HR) reached 160 beats/min. Then, they
cycled for 10 min while keeping their HR at 160 beats/min. The cognitive
tasks were performed 3 min after their HR reached 160 beats/min. The air
temperature was maintained at 35°C and the relative humidity was
controlled at 70%. Neck cooling was applied to the backside of the neck
by a wet towel and fanning. We used accuracy of the Spatial DR and
Go/No-Go tasks and reaction time in the Go/No-Go task to assess
cognitive function.

## Results

Neck cooling temporarily decreased the skin temperature during exercise.
The accuracy of the cognitive tasks was lower during exercise than that
at rest in the Hot and Hot + Cooling condition (p \< 0.05). There were
no differences in the accuracy between the Hot and Hot + Cooling
conditions (p = 0.98). Neither exercise (p = 0.40) nor cooling
(p = 0.86) affected reaction time. These results indicate that temporal
neck cooling did not alter cognitive function during strenuous exercise
in a hot environment.

## Conclusions

The present study suggests that temporal neck cooling with a wet towel
and fanning is not effective for attenuating impairment of working
memory and executive function during strenuous exercise with a short
duration in a warm and humid environment.

# Results and discussion

## Exercise intensity and HR

Table [1](#) shows exercise intensity and HR after the participants
reached a HR of 160 beats/min. We observed a significant main effect of
Time Course (F \[9,63\] = 45.02, p \< 0.001, η^2^ = 0.87) on exercise
intensity. There were no significant main effect of Condition (F
\[1,7\] = 1.62, p = 0.24, η^2^ = 0.19) and interaction (F
\[9,63\] = 1.01, p = 0.44, η^2^ = 0.13). These results indicate that
exercise intensity decreased as time elapsed and the degree of decrease
was not different between conditions. Similarly, we found a significant
main effect of Time Course (F \[9,63\] = 6.39, p \< 0.001, η^2^ = 0.48)
on HR. There were no significant main effect of Condition (F
\[1,7\] = 2.91, p = 0.13, η^2^ = 0.29) and interaction (F
\[9,63\] = 0.81, p = 0.61, η^2^ = 0.10). The significant main effect of
Time Course may be ascribed to a slight higher HR around the first 3 min
after the participants' HR reached 160 beats/min. Overall, HR appears to
be well controlled around the target level in the present study.

## RPE, blood lactate concentration, body weight, and body temperature

Table [2](#) shows RPE, blood lactate concentration, body weight, and
body temperature. We found significant main effects of Exercise on RPE
(F \[1,7\] = 174.49, p \< 0.001, η^2^ = 0.96), blood lactate
concentration (F \[1,7\] = 43.02, p \< 0.001, η^2^ = 0.86), body weight
(F \[1,7\] = 55.30, p \< 0.001, η^2^ = 0.89), and body temperature (F
\[1,7\] = 56.82, p \< 0.001, η^2^ = 0.89). In contrast, Condition did
not affect these parameters. There were no significant interactions.
Collectively, exercise increased RPE and blood lactate concentrations to
the same extent in both conditions. The degree of dehydration and
increase in body temperature were not different between conditions.
Indeed, we observed no difference in weight reduction between conditions
(0.41 ± 0.07% in the Hot condition and 0.37 ± 0.22% in the Hot + Cooling
condition).

## Effects of neck cooling on skin temperature

Figure [2](#) illustrates the skin temperature during exercise. The main
effects of Time Course (F \[1,9\] = 9.60, p \< 0.001, η^2^ = 0.58) and
Condition (F \[1,7\] = 8.03, p \< 0.05, η^2^ = 0.53) were significant.
There was a significant interaction between Condition and Time Course (F
\[9,63\] = 8.88, p \< 0.001, η^2^ = 0.56). These results indicate that
skin temperature changed in a different manner between conditions. We
observed significant differences in skin temperature between conditions
after neck cooling. However, the effects of neck cooling were temporal
and did not last until the end of the exercise.

## Cognitive function

Figure [3](#) illustrates the accuracy of the cognitive task (A) and
reaction time in the Go-trial (B). We observed a significant main effect
of Exercise on the accuracy of the cognitive task (F \[1,7\] = 8.78,
p \< 0.05, η^2^ = 0.56). We found neither a significant main effect of
Condition (F \[1,7\] = 0.001, p = 0.98, η^2^ \< 0.001) nor a significant
interaction (F \[1,7\] = 0.27, p = 0.62, η^2^ = 0.04). These results
indicate that the accuracy of the cognitive task significantly decreased
during exercise, and that temporal neck cooling had no effects on the
accuracy of the cognitive task. Reaction time in the Go-trial was not
affected by Exercise (F \[1,7\] = 0.802, p = 0.40, η^2^ = 0.10) or
Condition (F \[1,7\] = 0.03, p = 0.86, η^2^ = 0.005) in the present
study.

To our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of temporal neck
cooling on cognitive impairment during strenuous exercise in a hot
environment. We tested if temporal neck cooling with a wet towel and
fanning has beneficial effects on cognitive function during strenuous
exercise with a short duration in a hot environment. The main finding of
this study was that temporal neck cooling did not attenuate the
detrimental effects on cognitive function during strenuous exercise in a
hot environment. The present finding suggests that temporal neck cooling
with a wet towel and fanning is not effective enough to attenuate
cognitive impairment during strenuous exercise with a short duration in
a warm and humid environment.

We assessed cognitive function using the combination of spatial DR task
and Go/No-Go task. The Spatial DR task requires working memory
\[[25](#), [29](#)\]. The Go/No-Go task requires executive function,
including selective attention, response inhibition and interference
control \[[30](#), [31](#)\]. The prefrontal and parietal cortices play
a key role in spatial working memory \[[32](#)--[35](#)\]. Activation in
the prefrontal cortex is crucial for executive function \[[36](#),
[37](#)\]. Furthermore, the frontopolar cortex, which is located at the
most anterior part of the frontal cortex, is selectively activated in
multi-tasking where execution of the primary task was maintained in a
pending state while performing a secondary task \[[38](#)\]. Given that
the present cognitive task was a modified version of multi-tasking, the
present cognitive task required activation of the frontopolar cortex.
Taken together, we can assume that the present cognitive task was
appropriate to assess higher cognitive function in humans.

In the present study, HR was maintained at 160 beats/min during
exercise. Indeed, RPE was approximately 16 immediately after the
cognitive tasks during exercise. Furthermore, blood lactate
concentration increased above 5 mmol/l after exercise in both
conditions. Hence, in the present study, we can assume that exercise
intensity was classified as strenuous.

Skin cooling may reduce thermal strain and/or discomfort at rest and
during exercise \[[5](#), [9](#)--[13](#)\]. Thus, physiological as well
as psychological changes induced by skin cooling may somehow attenuate
the impairment in cognitive function during exercise in a hot
environment. Previous studies indicated that head and neck cooling with
frozen packs prevented the impairment of short-term memory \[[14](#),
[39](#)\]. In the present study, the accuracy of the cognitive task
decreased during exercise in the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions. We
observed no differences in the accuracy of the cognitive task during
exercise between conditions. These results suggest that temporal neck
cooling for a short period did not have beneficial effects on cognitive
function during exercise in a hot environment under the present
condition. In the present study, while neck cooling temporarily
decreased skin temperature, neck cooling did not alter body temperature.
These results mean that the neck cooling applied in this study was not
effective enough to decrease body temperature. The present results are
in line with the findings showing that skin cooling did not reduce body
temperature \[[9](#)--[11](#), [40](#)\]. Moreover, we found no
differences in RPE between conditions. Therefore, the lack of beneficial
effects of temporal neck cooling on cognitive function would be ascribed
to that physiological and/or psychological changes induced by brief neck
cooling was not sufficient enough to attenuate the detrimental effects
on cognitive function.

Dehydration is one of the potential factors that may impair cognitive
function in a hot environment. Hence, we used strenuous exercise with a
short duration. We expected that severe dehydration is unlikely to occur
even in a hot environment in the present study. Indeed, weight reduction
was less than 0.5% in the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions. Previous
studies suggested that dehydration may impair complex cognitive tasks
when weight reduction was greater than 2% \[[21](#), [22](#), [39](#)\].
Indeed, Gaoua et al. \[[39](#)\] suggested that, when weight reduction
did not exceed 0.5%, fluid replacement is adequate and dehydration does
not alter cognitive function. Hence, we can assume that the effects of
dehydration on cognitive function were negligible in the present study.

In contrast to the accuracy of the cognitive task, reaction time in the
Go-trial was not altered by exercise. These results suggest that the
effects of strenuous exercise in a hot environment are different between
accuracy and speed of response. Previous studies indicated that nerve
conduction velocity increases in the hot environment \[[14](#),
[39](#)\]. Thus, exercise in a hot environment may increase in nerve
conduction velocity, which leads to the decrease in reaction time.
However, in the present study, it is unclear whether reaction time was
not affected by strenuous exercise or whether increases in conduction
velocity in a hot environment was not effective, possibly due to a short
duration of exercise. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility
that increases in nerve conduction velocity compensated for the negative
effects of strenuous exercise on speed of response. Provided that
multiple factors are responsible for changes in response speed during
exercise, further studies will be required to elucidate these points.

It has been suggested that increase in arousal level induced by exercise
affect cognitive function \[[41](#), [42](#)\]. From this viewpoint, the
present results may suggest that arousal level went beyond the optimal
level during strenuous exercise in a hot environment, and that temporal
neck cooling was not effective to alter arousal level. However,
physiological mechanisms underlying the alterations in arousal level
during exercise remains to be elucidated. Thus, further studies are
required to understand the association between arousal level and
cognitive function.
