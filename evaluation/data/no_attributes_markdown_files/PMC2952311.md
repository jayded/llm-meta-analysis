Abstract

Acupressure on local and distal acupuncture points might result in
sedation and relaxation, thereby reducing chronic neck pain. The aim was
to investigate the effect of acupressure at local (LP) and distal
acupuncture points (DP) in females with chronic neck pain. Thirty-three
females were assigned to three groups: the control group did not receive
any stimuli, the LP group received acupressure at local acupuncture
points, GB 21, SI 14 and SI 15, and the DP group received acupressure at
distal acupuncture points, LI 4, LI 10 and LI 11. Verbal rating scale
(VRS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
(STAI), muscle hardness (MH), salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) activity,
heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) values and satisfaction
due to acupressure were assessed. VRS, NDI, STAI and MH values decreased
after acupressure in the LP and the DP group. HR decreased and the power
of high frequency (HF) component of HRV increased after acupressure in
only the LP group. Although acupressure on not only the LP but also the
DP significantly improved pain conditions, acupressure on only the LP
affected the autonomic nervous system while acupuncture points per se
have different physical effects according to location.

# 3. Results

[Table 1](#) shows the demographic data of the three groups. There were
no significant differences in age, weight, and pre-treatment values
regarding pain conditions among the three groups ([Table 1](#)).

There were no significant differences in all parameters in the control
group. VRS ([Figure 3](#)), STAI-I ([Figure 4](#)), and MH ([Figure
5](#)) values significantly decreased immediately after treatment, and
NDI ([Figure 6](#)) was lower at 1 day following treatment compared with
pre-treatment in the LP and the DP groups. HR ([Figure 7](#))
significantly decreased and the HF component of HRV ([Figure 9](#))
significantly increased after treatment in the LP group only. There were
no differences on the sAA and the LF components ([Figure 8](#)) and the
LF/HF ratio ([Figure 10](#)) of HRV among the three groups. Satisfaction
due to acupressure continued to 1 day after the treatment in the LP and
the DP groups ([Figure 11](#)).
