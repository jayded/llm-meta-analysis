Abstract

## Background

The effect of dietary calcium on fecal fat excretion in lactose
maldigestion is not known.

## Objective

To investigate the effect of dairy and nondairy dietary calcium on fecal
fat excretion in lactose digesters and maldigesters during moderate
energy restriction.

## Design

A randomized cross-over trial comparing the effect of 500 mg vs. 1500 mg
dairy and nondairy calcium on fecal fat excretion in 34 healthy adults
during moderate (− 30%) energy restriction diet-induced weight loss for
12 weeks. The participants were classified as lactose digester or
maldigester on the basis of breath hydrogen test.

## Measurements

Anthropometric parameters and body composition, resting energy
expenditure, energy and nutrient intake, fecal fat, physical activity,
blood pressure, blood and urine sampling for pertinent measurements.

## Results

Fecal fat loss expressed as percent of fat intake was significantly
higher with 1500 mg (high-Ca) compared to 500 mg (low-Ca) calcium intake
per day (mean: 3.0%; the 95% CI: 2.3 to 3.7%; *P* \<0.001) independent
of calcium source and lactose digestion status.

## Conclusions

During moderate energy restriction induced weight loss a high-Ca diet
causes an increase in fecal fat excretion independent of calcium source.
Calcium intake related fecal fat loss is also independent of the ability
to digest lactose and it is not diminished over time.

# RESULTS

A total of 51 volunteers were recruited for the study, 40 were
randomized, and 34 completed the study (19 Caucasians, 11 African
Americans, and 4 declaring other ethnicities). One participant was
dropped due to noncompliance, and five withdrew between week 1 and week
8. Baseline and end of the study characteristics of participants who
completed the study are shown in [Table 1](#). There was no difference
in initial weight and body composition between lactose maldigesters and
digesters and between dairy and nondairy diets (all *P* \>0.05).

## Dietary intake and compliance with the study diets

The participants had an average energy intake of 7.5 ± 1.5 MJ ([Table
2](#)). The average intake of energy from carbohydrates, fat, and
protein was 54.5 ± 3.0%, 28.9 ± 2.6%, and 18.4 ± 1.85%, respectively.
There were no differences between macronutrient and fiber content
between the diets (dairy vs. nondairy). Average amount of calcium in
low-Ca and high-Ca diets was 503 ± 73 and 1491 ± 131 mg/day,
respectively and the level was not different between dairy and nondairy
diets. There were no significant differences between the intake of
protein, sodium, and potassium and their respective biological markers
in weekly urine collections. Ratio of nitrogen in urine and
corresponding protein intake were not significantly different between
the dairy and nondairy diets (1.13 ± 0.41 and 1.01 ± 0.14, *P* = 0.105).
There were also no differences between the ratios of reported intake and
excretion between dairy and nondairy diets for sodium (0.96 ± 0.20 and
0.95 ± 0.19, *P* = 0.917) and potassium (1.15 ± 0.23 and 1.12 ± 0.16,
*P* = 0.684).

## Fecal fat excretion

The average fecal fat loss ([Table 3](#)) over 6 weeks was significantly
higher with high-Ca diet than that with low-Ca diet after adjusting for
gender, lactose digestion status, and dairy or nondairy diet source
(mean: 3.0%; the 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3 to 3.7%; *P* \<
0.001). The fecal fat loss increased correspondingly with cross-over to
high-Ca diet and vice versa ([Figure 1](#)). It was also significantly
higher in females than that in males after adjusting for calcium intake
level, lactose digestion status, and dairy or nondairy diet source
(mean: 2.0%; the 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.9%; *P* \< 0.001). There was no
significant difference in fecal fat loss between lactose digesters and
maldigesters ([Figure 2](#)) after adjusting for gender, calcium intake
level, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 0.2%; the 95% CI: −0.5
to 1.0%; *P* = 0.544). There was a significant positive correlation
between calcium intake and fecal fat excretion in dairy (r = 0.460) and
nondairy (r = 0.555) diets and in lactose digesters (r = 0.562) and
maldigesters (r = 0.463, all *P* \>0.05). Although not statistically
significant, the average fecal fat loss over 12 weeks was higher in
nondairy than that in dairy diet group ([Figure 1](#)) after adjusting
for calcium intake level, lactose digestion status and gender (mean:
0.5%; the 95% CI: −0.2 to 1.2%; *P* = 0.150). In females, the average
fecal fat loss over 6 weeks tended to be higher with the non-dairy than
that with the dairy diet after adjusting for calcium intake level and
lactose digestion status (mean: 0.8%; the 95% CI: −0.1 to 1.6%; *P* =
0.067).

## Urinary calcium excretion

Urinary calcium excretion ([Table 4](#)) was significantly higher in
high-Ca than low-Ca (128.3± 57.9 and 146.4 ± 77.9 mg/day^−1^; the 95% CI
for difference: 3.8 to 31.1 mg/day; *P* = 0.014). The differences in
calcium excretion were not different between dairy vs. nondairy diets
and in digesters vs. maldigesters (all *P* \> 0.05).

## Body weight and body composition

After following an energy restricted diet for 12 weeks ([Table 1](#)),
there were no significant differences in weight loss between dairy and
nondairy diets (8.5 ± 2.7 and 7.2 ± 2.8 kg, *P* = 0.116). However, there
were significant differences in weight changes in lactose digesters vs.
maldigesters (9.2 ± 2.2 and 6.6 ± 2.4, *P* = 0.003). There was also
significant differences between first and second 6-week study periods
(5.6± 1.8 and 2.8 ± 1.7 kg, *P*= 0.001). The differences between dairy
and nondairy diets were not significant during the first 6-week (5.7 ±
1.9 and 5.5 ± 1.7 kg) or second 6-week (2.9 ± 1.9 and 2.9 ± 1.8 kg)
periods. There were also no significant differences in body fat changes
across groups, dairy vs. nondairy (5.4 ± 1.5 and 4.1 ± 1.5; *P* = 0.393)
or lactose digesters vs. maldigesters (5.5 ± 1.3 vs. 4.8 ± 1.7; *P* =
0.206). There were also no differences in the amount of total body water
between the groups.

## Resting energy expenditure (REE) and physical activity

There was a difference in REE between the baseline and the end of the
study (7.31±1.31 vs. 6.74 ± 1.32 MJ) which became insignificant when REE
was adjusted for fat free mass and fat mass (data not shown). There were
not REE differences between digesters and maldigesters ([Table 6](#)).
The differences in the amount of physical activity measured using RT3
accelerometers during the entire study were also not significant.
Participants did not change physical activity level (PAL) during the
study ([Table 6](#)).

## Blood pressure and blood parameters

Diet had no significant effect on either systolic or diastolic blood
pressure ([Table 7](#)). Basic hematological parameters were not
different between groups (data is not shown). Diet did not have an
effect on serum concentrations of insulin and vitamin D. Leptin levels
decreased significantly after 12-week on the study diet independent of
diet and lactose digestion status (40.6 ± 20.3 vs. 27.3 ± 16.7 ng/ml,
*P* = 0.001, paired t-test).
