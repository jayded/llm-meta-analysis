Abstract

Vitamin D deficiency was common among patients with chronic hepatitis C
(CHC) and had negative influence on treatment outcome. Correction of
vitamin D deficiency improved treatment response. Interferon
gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP
IV) involved in inflammatory responses in CHC. Their higher levels at
pretreatment of CHC could predict poorer responses. Vitamin D suppressed
expression of IP-10 from monocytes *in vitro*. In CHC patients, DPP IV
involved in IP-10 regulation. We hypothesized that correction of vitamin
D insufficiency or deficiency in CHC patients might restore immune
dysregulation through a pathway linked to the TH1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10
or DPP IV. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 80 CHC
patients with vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were assigned to
receive vitamin D (40) or placebo (40) supplements for 6 weeks. The
levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D \[25(OH)D\], Th1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 and
DPP IV were measured at baseline and at the 6th week. At the end of
study, the mean 25(OH)D level in vitamin D group was significantly
increased and normalised. There were no changes in the level of Th1/Th2
cytokines. Our important finding revealed that upon correction of
vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, the serum IP-10 and DPP IV levels
were decreased significantly as compare to the placebo group (delta
changes; 83.27 vs -133.80; 95% CI \[-326.910, -40.758\], p = 0.0125, and
271.04 vs -518.69; 95% CI \[-1179,15, -59.781\], p = 0.0305,
respectively. As previous evidences suggested that each factor
individually influenced and predicted outcome of CHC treatment. Our
results offer a new insight and help to piece the puzzle of vitamin D
deficiency, IP-10 and DPP IV together in CHC.

# Results

## Study patients at baseline

From January to December 2014, 80 patients were included into this study
and randomly assigned to receive a placebo (n = 40) vitamin D supplement
(n = 40). 42 patients were naïve cases without previous CHC treatment
and 38 patients were previously failed therapy either relapsers or
non-responders. Demographic and clinical characteristics were shown in
[Table 1](#). The mean age was 52.39 years (range; 30--70).

In each group, 52.5% and 47.5% of patients were naïve HCV status and
previously failed therapy respectively. The mean 25(OH)D level was 20.27
± 4.83 ng/mL and 20.88 ± 5.40 ng/mL in placebo and vitamin D group
respectively. Other parameters including HCV genotypes, HCV viral loads,
transaminase levels and liver fibrosis scores were not significant
between two groups ([Table 1](#)).

The mean IP-10 level in placebo group was slightly lower than the levels
in vitamin D group (665.61 pg/mL vs 770.27 pg/mL) without statistical
differences. While the mean DPP IV levels in placebo was slightly higher
than the level in vitamin D group (6551.1 ng/mL vs 6137.7 npg/mL)
without statistical differences. There were no significant differences
in the baseline serum Th1/2 cytokines and DPP IV between two groups
([Table 1](#)).

## Changes of parameters at 6-week supplements

At the end of 6-week supplements, the median and range of serum 25(OH)D
levels in the placebo and vitamin D groups were 21.22 (10.4--30.2)
ng/mL, 45.93 (14.5--81.1) ng/mL, respectively. Vitamin D deficiency were
corrected in all 40 patients who received vitamin D supplement. While
vitamin D levels remained low and were not changed from the baseline
levels in the placebo group ([Table 2](#) and [Fig 2](#)).

After 6 weeks, the delta value of IP-10 level was decreased
significantly in vitamin D group, as compared to the increased level in
placebo group, -133.8 vs 83.27 pg/mL; 95% CI \[326.910, -40.758\], p =
0.0125 ([Table 3](#) and [Fig 2](#)).

The mean serum DPP IV levels were not significant difference between
pre-and post-supplements in both groups. During 6-week period, the mean
DPP IV level in placebo group had trend to increase, and on the opposite
direction, the mean level was decreased in vitamin D group. Comparing
the mean changes (or delta changes) between the two groups showed
significant differences, placebo group 255.46 ± 216.35 vs vitamin D
group -521.79 ± 228.09; 95% CI \[-1179.15, -59.781\], p = 0.03 ([Table

An effect size analysis (Cohen's d) was used to a quantitative measure
of the strength of the outcome. The result showed strong magnitude of
vitamin d changes (2.47), and moderate effect of VD on the changes of
IP-10 (0.59) and DPP IV (0.55) levels ([Table 3](#)). The results also
suggested that this RCT was performed with reasonable number of cases.

We try to assess whether in this total population (80 CHC cases), serum
levels of VD would affect the IP-10 levels in general. As shown in the
scatter plot ([Fig 3](#)), even the dots are quite scattered, the best
fit line could be plotted and the regression equation of \[IP-10 =
841.34--4.45 x VD\] was demonstrated. In other words, we could postulate
that serum IP-10 decreases with increase in serum VD levels, and each
unit of VD increase will lead to 4.5 unit decrease in serum IP-10.
