Abstract

## Introduction

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of certolizumab
pegol (CZP) treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), fatigue
and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA).

## Methods

Patients with active RA (N = 982) were randomized 2:2:1 to subcutaneous
CZP (400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4; followed by CZP 200 mg or 400 mg) plus
methotrexate (MTX) every other week, or placebo (PBO) plus MTX. PRO
assessments included HRQoL, fatigue, physical function, arthritis pain
and disease activity. Adjusted mean changes from baseline in all PROs
were obtained using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) applying last
observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation. The proportion of
patients achieving clinically meaningful improvements in each PRO was
obtained using logistic regression and by applying non-responder
imputation to missing values after rescue medication or withdrawal. The
correlations between PRO responses and clinical responses were also
assessed by tetrachoric correlation using non-responder imputation.

## Results

Patients treated with CZP plus MTX reported significant (*P* \< 0.001),
clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL at the first assessment
(week 12); reductions in fatigue, disease activity and pain and
improvements in physical function were reported at week 1. In
particular, CZP-treated patients reported improvements in mental health.
Mean changes from baseline in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS)
at week 52 for CZP 200 mg and 400 mg plus MTX, and PBO plus MTX were
6.4, 6.4 and 2.1, respectively (*P* \< 0.001). In addition, mental
health and vitality scores in CZP-treated patients approached age- and
gender-adjusted US population norms. Improvements in all PROs were
sustained. Similar benefits were reported with both CZP doses. Changes
in SF-36 MCS scores had the lowest correlation with disease activity
scores (DAS28) and American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement
(ACR20) response rates, while improvements in pain showed the highest
correlation.

## Conclusions

Treatment with CZP plus MTX resulted in rapid and sustained improvements
in all PROs, indicating that the benefits of CZP extend beyond clinical
efficacy endpoints into areas that are more relevant and meaningful for
patients on a daily basis.

# Results

## Patients

A total of 982 patients were randomized in RAPID 1: 393 to CZP 200 mg
plus MTX, 390 to CZP 400 mg plus MTX, and 199 to PBO plus MTX. Of these,
255 (64.9%), 274 (70.3%) and 43 (21.6%) completed 52 weeks of treatment,
respectively \[[28](#)\]. At baseline, 82% of patients were female, with
mean age 52 years, 77% rheumatoid factor positive, mean disease duration
6.2 years, and having failed a mean of 1.4 disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; excluding MTX). The burden of RA at
baseline was significant, as evidenced by patient-reported global
assessment of disease activity, pain, physical function, and fatigue
scores (Table [1](#)). In particular, SF-36 domain scores at baseline
were markedly lower than age- and gender-matched US population norms,
and SF-36 MCS and PCS scores reflected a significant psychological
burden as well as physical impairments.

## Health-related quality of life and fatigue

RA patients receiving CZP plus MTX reported statistically significant
improvements in HRQoL compared with PBO plus MTX by the first
post-baseline assessment (week 12; *P* \< 0.001); improvements in all
eight SF-36 domains (Table [2](#)), PCS (Figure [1a](#)), and MCS
(Figure [1b](#)) were sustained to week 52. In particular, mean changes
from baseline at week 12 for the CZP 200 mg plus MTX, CZP 400 mg plus
MTX, and PBO plus MTX groups were 5.6, 5.5 and 2.0 for the SF-36 MCS,
respectively (Table [2](#); *P* \< 0.001). Significantly more patients
treated with CZP plus MTX than PBO plus MTX also reported improvements
in SF-36 MCS equal to or greater than the MCID from weeks 12 to 52
(Table [2](#); *P* \< 0.05).

Figure [2](#) shows the SF-36 domain scores for the CZP 200 mg and PBO
groups compared with normative values from an age/gender-matched US
population. Baseline domain scores reflect the largest decrements in the
Role Emotional mental domain, and the physical domains of Role Physical
and Physical Function (Figure [2](#)). Improvements exceeding MCID were
evident in all domains at week 12 and were sustained through week 52,
with the Mental Health and Vitality domains approaching US population
normative values.

Statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in

PBO plus MTX throughout the study (*P* \< 0.001; Figure [3a](#)). At
week 1, mean changes from baseline in FAS were -1.3 and -1.2 for CZP 200

plus MTX group (*P* \< 0.001), and by the end of the study (week 52),
mean changes from baseline were -2.6, -2.5 and -0.8, respectively (*P*

reductions in fatigue equal to or greater than the MCID compared with
PBO plus MTX (*P* \< 0.001; Figure [4a](#)). At week 52, 48.9% and 48.6%
of CZP 200 mg- and 400 mg-treated patients reported fatigue reductions
equal to or greater than the MCID compared with only 12.6% of

## Patient-reported physical function, pain and global assessment of disease activity

Rapid, statistically significant improvements in physical function, as
assessed by HAQ-DI, were reported by patients treated with CZP plus MTX
compared with PBO plus MTX (Figure [3b](#); *P* \< 0.001). By the end of
the study at week 52, mean scores were 1.1 for both CZP plus MTX
treatment groups, respectively, compared with baseline scores of 1.7.
Significantly more CZP plus MTX-treated patients than PBO plus
MTX-treated patients reported HAQ-DI improvements equal to or greater
than the MCID throughout the trial (*P* \< 0.001). CZP-treated patients
also reported statistically significant improvements in physical
function that met or exceeded MCID as reported above for SF-36 PCS
(Figure [1a](#)) and Physical Functioning domain scores (Table [2](#)).

CZP-treated patients reported significant improvements from baseline in
pain VAS (Figure [3c](#)) and patient\'s global assessment of disease
activity (Figure [3d](#); *P* \< 0.001), evident at week 1 and sustained
through week 52. Significantly more CZP plus MTX-treated patients than
PBO plus MTX-treated patients also reported clinically meaningful
reductions in pain (Figure [4c](#)) and improvements in global
assessment of disease activity (Figure [4d](#)) throughout the trial
(*P* \< 0.001). Results were similar regardless of CZP dose (200 mg or
400 mg).

Sensitivity analyses showed that improvements in all PROs were
consistent with the LOCF results.

## Comparison of patient-reported outcomes with DAS28 and ACR20 response rates

To explore the relation between the patient-reported outcomes and the
physician-reported assessments of disease, PRO responses (as defined by
improvements in physical function, pain, fatigue and SF-36 scores equal
to or greater than the MCIDs) were compared with DAS28 responses
(defined as a decrease from baseline of ≥ 1.2) and ACR20 response rates
at week 52. In general, PRO responses were in agreement with clinical
responses as determined by either improvements in RA signs and symptoms
(ACR20 response rates) or decrease in disease activity (DAS28 scores;
Table [3](#)). As expected, classification of response according to
physical function and pain was highly correlated with ACR20 response
rates, with 88.8% and 93.6% of patients treated with CZP 200 mg plus MTX
being classified the same by physical function/ACR20 and pain/ACR20,
respectively. Correlations between fatigue and ACR20 responses were also
high (90.0%) as were those between patient\'s global assessment of
disease activity (98.0%), while changes in HRQoL (SF-36 PCS and MCS
scores) had the lowest correlation with ACR20 responses (84.3% and
77.4%, respectively).
