Abstract

## Objective

To determine abnormal MRI findings in adults hospitalized with acute
severe axial LBP.

## Method

Sixty patients with back pain were divided into 3 groups consisting
of 1) 23 adults with acute axial severe LBP who could not sit up or
stand up for several days, but had not experienced previous back-related
diseases or trauma (group A), 2) 19 adults who had been involved in a
minor traffic accident, and had mild symptoms but not limited mobility
(group B), and 3) 18 adults with LBP with radicular pain (group C).,
Various MRI findings were assessed among the above 3 groups and compared
as follows: disc herniation (protrusion, extrusion), lumbar disc
degeneration (LDD), annular tear, high intensity zone (HIZ), and
endplate changes.

## Results

The MRI findings of A group were as follows: disc herniation (87%), LDD
(100%), annular tear (100%), HIZ (61%), and end plate changes (4.4%).
The findings of disc herniation, annular tear, HIZ, and LDD were more
prevalent in A group than in B group (p\<0.01). HIZ findings were more
prevalent in A group than in group B or group C (p\<0.05).

## Conclusion

Patients with acute severe axial LBP were more likely to have disc
herniation, LDD, annular tear, HIZ. Among LBP groups, there was a
significant association of HIZ on MRI with acute severe axial LBP.

# RESULTS

The frequencies of the MRI findings were as follows: In patients with
acute lower back pain (group A), disc herniation (87%), LDD (100%),
annular tear (100%), HIZ (61%), and Modic change (4.4%); in patients
with mild lower back pain caused by a simple vehicle accident (control
group B), disc herniation (31.6%), LDD (47.4%), annulus tear (26.3%),
HIZ (21.1%), and Modic change (10.5%); and in patients with severe
radiating lower back pain (control group C), disc herniation (100%), LDD
(100%), annulus tear (94.4%), HIZ (16.7%), and Modic changes (27.7%)
([Table 1](#)).

In all groups, (80%) of the disc changes were in L4-5 and L5-S1 ([Table
2](#)). There were significant differences in the disc herniation, HDD,
annulus tear, and HIZ between the patients with acute severe lower back
pain (group A) and the control group B (p\<0.05) ([Table 3](#)). The
proportion of HIZ incidence was significantly higher in group A than in
control group B, and in the patients with severe radiating pain (control
group C) (p\<0.05) ([Table 3](#)). It was difficult to give clinical
meaning to the Modic change, as its frequency was low.
