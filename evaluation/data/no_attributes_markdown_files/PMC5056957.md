Abstract

## BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:

Obesity prevention during adolescence is a health priority. The
'Physical Activity 4 Everyone\' (PA4E1) study tested a multi-component
physical activity intervention in 10 secondary schools from
socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This paper aimed to report
the secondary outcomes of the study; to determine whether the
intervention impacted on adiposity outcomes (weight, body mass index
(BMI), BMI *z*-score), and whether any effect was moderated by sex,
baseline BMI and baseline physical activity level, at 12 and 24 months.

## SUBJECTS/METHODS:

A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in New South Wales,
Australia. The school-based intervention included seven physical
activity strategies targeting the following: curriculum (strategies to
maximise physical activity in physical education, student physical
activity plans, an enhanced school sport programme); school environment
(physical activity during school breaks, modification of school policy);
and parents and the community (parent engagement, links with community
physical activity providers). Students\' weight (kg), BMI and BMI
*z*-score, were collected at baseline (Grade 7), 12 and 24 months.
Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between-group mean difference
from baseline to 12 and 24 months. Exploratory sub-analyses were
undertaken according to three moderators of energy balance.

## RESULTS:

A total of 1150 students (mean age=12 years) provided outcome data at
baseline, 1051 (91%) at 12 months and 985 (86%) at 24 months. At 12
months, there were group-by-time effects for weight (mean
difference=--0.90 kg (95% confidence interval (CI)=--1.50, −0.30),
*P*\<0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.50, −0.06), *P*=0.01) in favour
of the intervention group, but not for BMI *z*-score (−0.05 (−0.11;
0.01), *P*=0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (−0.62 kg
(−1.21, 0.03), *P*=0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.49, −0.06),
*P*=0.01) at 24 months, with group-by-time effects also found for BMI
*z*-score (−0.08 (−0.14; −0.02), *P*=0.02) favouring the intervention
group.

## CONCLUSION:

The PA4E1 school-based intervention achieved moderate reductions in
adiposity among adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged
communities. Multi-component interventions that increase adolescents\'
engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) may assist
in preventing unhealthy weight gain.

# Results

## Sample

Of the 22 eligible schools, 13 were approached to participate in the
study. Ten schools consented to participate (77%) and parental consent
was obtained for 1233 of the 1468 Grade-7 students in the 10 schools
(84%). A total of 1150 students provided adiposity outcome data at
baseline, 1051 (91%) at mid-point (12 months) and 985 (86%) at 24
months. Demographic characteristics of the sample at baseline, 12 and 24
months are outlined in [Table 1](#). At baseline, the mean age of
participants was 12 years, 51% were female, 17% were overweight and 5%
were obese, and 64% did not meet the physical activity recommendation of
⩾60 min of MVPA per day. Participants who were lost to follow-up were
more likely to be older in age (*P*=0.03) and did not speak English as a
primary language (*P*=0.02) compared with those who provided outcome
data at all time points.

At 24 months, all 5 intervention schools had implemented 6 of the 7
physical activity strategies. The exception was strategy 5 (school
policy); 4 of the 5 schools had developed a school policy. All
intervention implementation strategies were delivered as planned. The
majority of intervention group PE teachers (*n*=35) reported using
pedometers to increase activity levels in PE (88.9%), and 58.8% reported
including student physical activity plans each term. All schools were
represented by at least one PE teacher (range 1--5) at each professional
learning workshop. More information on intervention delivery can be
found in the 24-month physical activity outcome paper.^[16](#)^

## Indicators of adiposity

The results for the 12- and 24-month adiposity outcomes are presented in
[Table 2](#). At 12 months, there were group-by-time effects for weight
(mean difference (95% CI) =−0.90 kg (−1.50; −0.30), *P*\<0.01) and BMI
(−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.50; −0.06), *P*=0.01) in favour of the intervention
group, but not for BMI *z*-score (−0.05 (−0.11; 0.01), *P*=0.13). These
findings were consistent for weight (−0.62 kg (−1.21; −0.03), *P*=0.01)
and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.49; −0.06), *P*=0.01) at 24 months, with
group-by-time effects also found for BMI *z*-score (−0.08 (−0.14;
−0.02), *P*=0.02) favouring the intervention group. Intervention effects
were significant for all adiposity outcomes at 12 and 24 months in both
the complete cases and multiple imputation analyses ([Supplementary
Appendix 1 and 2](#)).

## Subgroup analyses

The results of the subgroup analyses are presented in [Supplementary
Appendix 3](#).

### Sex

There was weak evidence of a differential treatment on effect on weight
in males compared with females (three-way interaction *P*=0.22). Among
males there was a statistically significant treatment effect at 24
months in favour of the intervention group (−1.26 kg (−2.11; −0.41),
*P*=0.01). There were no significant effects on weight, BMI and BMI
*z*-score at either 12 or 24 months for females.

### Weight status at baseline

We found very little evidence of differential treatment effects
depending on baseline weight for weight (*P*=0.50), BMI (*P*=0.57) or
BMI *z*-score (*P*=0.64). Nevertheless, we did observe the following
results.

Among underweight and normal weight participants combined, there were
significant effects for weight (−0.71 kg (−1.28; −0.14), *P*=0.04), BMI
(−0.33 kg m^−2^ (−0.55; −0.10), *P*=0.01) and BMI *z*-score (−0.08
(−0.15; −0.01), *P*=0.01) in favour of the intervention group at
12-month follow-up. Similar findings for weight (−0.71 kg (−1.28;
−0.14), *P*=0.04), BMI (−0.33 kg m^−2^ (−0.55; −0.10), *P*=0.01) and BMI
*z*-score (−0.08 (−0.15; −0.01), *P*=0.01) in underweight/normal weight
participants were found at 24 months in favour of the intervention
group.

Among overweight and obese students, no significant effects were found
at 12 or 24 months for weight (12 months=−1.29 kg (−3.12; 0.53),
*P*=0.16; 24 months=−1.16 kg (−2.98; 0.67), *P*=0.30), BMI (12
months=−0.39 kg m^−2^ (−1.01; 0.22), *P*=0.21; 24 months=−0.18 kg m^−2^
(−0.80; 0.44), *P*=0.45) and BMI *z*-score (12 months=−0.07 (−0.21;
0.07), *P*=0.31; 24 months=−0.00 (−0.14; 0.14), *P*=0.54).

### Physical activity level at baseline

We found no evidence of differential treatment effects depending on
activity status at baseline for weight (*P*=0.94), BMI (*P*=0.95) or BMI
*z*-score (*P*=0.31).There was no significant effect on weight, BMI or
BMI *z*-score for either active or inactive students at 12 or 24 months.
