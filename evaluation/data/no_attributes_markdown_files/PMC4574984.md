Abstract

## Purpose

This randomized controlled, clinical prospective interventional trial
was aimed at exploring the effect of patient empowerment on short- and
long-term outcomes after major oncologic surgery in elderly cancer
patients.

## Methods

This trial was performed from February 2011 to January 2014 at two
tertiary medical centers in Germany. The study included patients aged 65
years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal,
genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned
to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information
booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received
standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks
of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative
length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed
using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed
postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the
identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.

## Results

Overall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 ± 4.9 years, and
the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The \^median of
postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7--14 day). There were no
significant differences between the intervention and the control groups
in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p
= 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major
complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively,
frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly
between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported
significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group.
Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery,
length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional
state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the
Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions.

## Conclusion

Patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did
not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but
improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative
length of stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state,
pre-operative functional impairment, severity of surgery, and length of
anesthesia.

## Trial Registration

Clinicaltrials.gov. Identifier [NCT01278537](#)

# Results

## Patient recruitment

The outline of patient recruitment and follow-up is shown in [Fig 1](#).
The final sample consisted of 652 patients. Of these, 326 patients were
assigned to the intervention-group and 326 patients were assigned to the
control-group. After 12 months, questionnaires were sent to the
patients. 103 patients (15.8%) had died. We received 450 questionnaires
out of 549 (79%). Loss to follow-up was 15.2% (n = 99) after 12 months.
Follow-up after 3 months was of no concern for the primary endpoints and
is not considered in this analysis.

## Baseline characteristics

The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are
listed in Tables [1](#) and [2](#). The mean age of all patients was 72
± 4.9 years. There were more men (68.6%) than women (31.4%).
Distribution of tumor site is also shown in [Table 1](#). There were no
differences regarding age, gender and tumor distribution between both
groups (p = 0.5; p = 0.24 and p = 0.74 respectively). All other
demographic and clinical data were comparable in intervention and
control group ([Table 1](#)).

Furthermore, there were no differences regarding functional and
cognitive tests assessed by the geriatric assessment ([Table 2](#)).

In the intervention group, 193 (59%) patients rated the empowerment
package as helpful or very helpful. A narrow majority of 186 (57%) kept
the diary for at least 50% of the planned days, whereas 82 (25%)
patients kept the diary for less than 50% of the planned days. In 58
cases (17.8%) information about diary keeping is entirely missing.

### Postoperative in-hospital stay

[Fig 2](#) shows the postoperative in-hospital stay: Duration ranged
from 0 to 139 days, with a median of 9 days (Interquartile Range, IQR:
7) for all patients. There was no significant difference between both
groups (p = 0.99).

## Primary long-term outcome

### Health-Related Quality of Life at 12 month

At baseline mean global health-related quality of life in the
intervention group was 53.95 (95% CI 49.12--58.77) in women and 68.79
(95% CI 65.90--71.69) in men. In the control group, the global HRQoL was
50.41 (95% CI 44.88--55.93) in women and 65.37 (95% CI 62.23--68.52) in
men. There were no statistical differences between the groups (woman: p
= 0.294; men: p = 0.196).

After 12 months, questionnaires were sent to the patients. In the
intervention group, 229 questionnaires were sent back, versus 221
questionnaires in the control group. The EORTC QLQ_C30 questionnaire was
completed in n = 227 in the intervention group and n = 216 in the
control group. Mean global HRQoL after 12 months was 69.27 (95% CI
66.45--72.14) in the intervention group and 69.79 (95% CI 66.84--72.74)
in the control group (p = 0.74) ([Fig 3](#)). The global HRQoL after 12
months of women in the intervention group was 61.07 (95% CI
55.42--66.71) compared to 63.27 (95% CI 58.28--68.25) in the control
group (p = 0.54). Males in the intervention group had a mean global
HRQoL after 12 months of 72.49 (CI95% 69.34--75.65) compared to 71.71
(95% CI 68.21--75.20) in the control group (p = 0.94). There was no
significant difference between the global HRQoL 12 months after surgery
in the intervention and in the control group (all patients: p = 0.74;
women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94).

Compared to age and gender-adjusted reference values for the German
population \[[18](#)\], men showed better global health-related quality
of life than the reference population. In contrast, women quoted a lower
score of global HRQoL without clinical relevance (\< 5 points) ([Fig

<figcaption>Course of HRQoL.<br />
Comparing the baseline and follow-up values for health-related quality
of life only for patients who survived and answered the 12 months
questionnaire (n = 418), there were neither clinical relevant nor
statistical significant differences between baseline and 12 months for
HRQoL (intervention women: p = 0.58; men: p = 0.49; control women: p =
0.16; men = 0.29). Compared to age and gender-adjusted reference values
for the German population [<a href="#">18</a>], men showed better global
health-related quality of life than the reference population with
clinical relevance. In contrast, women quoted a lower score of global
HRQoL but without clinical relevance.</figcaption>

## Secondary outcomes

### Postoperative morbidity

In total, 479 (74%) patients had at least one complication within
postoperative hospital stay ([Fig 5](#) and [Table 3](#)). Of these, 157
(24%) were classified as major complications according to the Clavien
Scale ([Fig 5](#)).

<figcaption>Perioperative complications.<br />
Overall complications occurred in 74% of the patients. There was no
difference between intervention and control group (p = 0.79). Major
(Clavien Grade III and higher) perioperative complications occurred in
24% of the patients. There was no difference between the groups (p =
0.41).</figcaption>

::::

The most frequent complications were cardiopulmonary complications
(30.8%), followed by anemia (15.2%) and infections (14.9%) ([Table
3](#)). Occurrence and severity of complications were comparable in both
groups, although severe hemorrhage occurred significantly more often in
the intervention group (6.7% vs. 2.5%; p = 0.01). Delirium screening was
positive in 66 (10.1%) patients with no difference between the
intervention and control group (p = 0.52). Due to postoperative
complications, 75 (11.5%) patients had to return to the operating
theatre.

### Postoperative stress: Mobilization, PONV and postoperative pain

Patients in the intervention group reported less pain on the first
postoperative day (75.2% vs. 82.3%, p = 0.03) ([Table 3](#)). There were
no differences regarding mobilization within the first 24 hours (69.2%
vs. 70.4%, p = 0.73), or PONV within the first five days (52.8% vs.
56.4%, p = 0.39). Further, there was no difference in the GDS between
intervention and control groups at discharge (p = 0.86).

### Readmission

The readmission rate within 90 days was slightly higher for patients in
the intervention group (62/245 = 25.3% vs. 59/248 = 23.8%, p = 0.70).
In-hospital length of stay at readmission was shorter than in the
standard of care group without reaching statistical significance (Median
LOS 6.5; IQR: 11 days vs. 10; IQR: 10 days; p = 0.22).

### Mortality

Ten patients (1.5%) died before hospital discharge. Seven of these
(1.1%) died within 30 days after surgery. In the intervention group, 6
(1.8%) patients died compared to 4 (1.2%) in the control group ([Fig
6](#)). At follow-up one year after surgery, 103 patients had died
(15.8%).

Within 30 days after surgery, 4 patients in the intervention and 3
patients in the control group had died (p = 0.75). One year after
surgery, 45 patients in the intervention group compared to 58 patients
in the control group had died (p = 0.19).</figcaption>

The overall mortality did not differ significantly between the two
groups (Log-Rank-test p = 0.197) ([Fig 7](#)).

### Predictors for length of in-hospital stay

The intervention was not significant in robust regression analysis for
primary endpoint LOS (-0.15; 95% CI -10.5--0.76; p = 0.75), whereas the
pre-operative malnutrition,a delayed Time Up and Go test, increased
length of anesthesia, severity of surgery, as well as postoperative
major complications had a significant influence on postoperative LOS
([S1 Table](#)).

### Predictors for HRQoL at 12 month

The intervention was not significant in multivariate analysis for
primary endpoint global HRQoL (EORTC QLQ C30), whereas the pre-operative
global HRQoL, CCS, ASA, MMSE, severity of surgery, as well as
postoperative major complications had the most significant influence on
the one-year HRQoL ([S2 Table](#)).

### Course of HRQoL

Completed baseline and 12 months follow-up EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaires
were available for 418 patients. In women, the mean difference from
baseline global HRQoL to global HRoL 12 months after surgery was -2.63 ±
27 in the intervention group, and -- 6,16 ± 25 in the control group (p =
0.37). In men, the mean difference score was -0.48 ± 24 in the
intervention group compared to -1.62 ± 25 in the control group (p =
0.71). Between the groups, there were no clinical or statistical
significant changes. Merely the women in the control group showed a
small clinical decline (5--9 points difference) \[[16](#)\]. Detailed
information of clinical changes (small, moderate, large) is provided in
[S1 Fig](#).
