Abstract

## Objective:

The objective of this study is to examine the impact of vary doses of
buprenorphine on anxiety symptoms in opioid-dependent inpatients over a
7 days period, using a randomized controlled trial design.

## Design:

Patients were randomized to three groups.

## Patients and Methods:

Fourteen men who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria for both opioid use disorder and
generalized anxiety disorder and were seeking for treatment.

## Intervention:

Patients obtain dosages of 32 mg or 64 mg or 96 mg of buprenorphine as a
single dose only and were treated in a psychiatric inpatient unit. Of 14
subjects; 5 (35.7%) obtained 32 mg, 4 (28.6%) obtained 64 mg, and 5
(35.7%) obtained 96 mg of buprenorphine.

## Measurements:

Administering daily Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and interview.

## Results:

All the patients ended the 7-day treatment time. The results showed a
significant reduction in anxiety symptoms within each of the three
groups ( *P* = 0.00), but no difference in outcome between the groups (
*P* = 0.605).

## Conclusions:

The outcome suggests a single high dose of buprenorphine can supply a
speedy, safe, simple, and suitable means of anxiety treatment. The
single high dose of buprenorphine could be a novel mechanism medication
that provides a rapid and sustained improvement for generalized anxiety
disorder in opioid dependent patients. Placebo-controlled trials of
longer duration are needed to evaluate ability, safety, and
psychological and physiological influence of extended exposure to this
medication.

# RESULTS

All the 14 inpatients completed the 7-day period study. Hence, the data
were gathered from 14 male opioid dependents whose mean age was 31.87 Â±
8.15 year; with age range of 17--48 years.

Out of 14 patients; 5 (35.7%) obtained 32 mg, 4 (28.6%) obtained 64 mg
and also 5 (35.7%) obtained 96 mg of buprenorphine.

Regarding marital status, age, education, and employment, we could not
find any statistically significant differences in groups.

[Table 1](#)demonstrates demographic features of the patients. As we
note, there are not any significant differences in their demographic
features.

[Table 2](#)represents anxiety scores of the groups during 7 days of
treatment time. As we look in 32-mg group, we note that there are
significant statistical differences in anxiety scores between day 1 and
day 7 ( *P* = 0.001). Similarly, there are significant differences in
anxiety scores between day 1 and day 7 both in 64-mg group ( *P* =
0.000) and 96-mg group ( *P* = 0.00).

Comparing the mean anxiety scores in three groups, we cannot see any
significant differences.
