# Abstract ## Background Poor sanitation is thought to be a major cause of enteric infections among young children. However, there are no previously published randomized trials to measure the health impacts of large-scale sanitation programs. India's Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) is one such program that seeks to end the practice of open defecation by changing social norms and behaviors, and providing technical support and financial subsidies. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of the TSC implemented with capacity building support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program in Madhya Pradesh on availability of individual household latrines (IHLs), defecation behaviors, and child health (diarrhea, highly credible gastrointestinal illness [HCGI], parasitic infections, anemia, growth). ## Methods and Findings We conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in 80 rural villages. Field staff collected baseline measures of sanitation conditions, behaviors, and child health (May--July 2009), and revisited households 21 months later (February--April 2011) after the program was delivered. The study enrolled a random sample of 5,209 children <5 years old from 3,039 households that had at least one child <24 months at the beginning of the study. A random subsample of 1,150 children <24 months at enrollment were tested for soil transmitted helminth and protozoan infections in stool. The randomization successfully balanced intervention and control groups, and we estimated differences between groups in an intention to treat analysis. The intervention increased percentage of households in a village with improved sanitation facilities as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme by an average of 19% (95% CI for difference: 12%--26%; group means: 22% control versus 41% intervention), decreased open defecation among adults by an average of 10% (95% CI for difference: 4%--15%; group means: 73% intervention versus 84% control). However, the intervention did not improve child health measured in terms of multiple health outcomes (diarrhea, HCGI, helminth infections, anemia, growth). Limitations of the study included a relatively short follow-up period following implementation, evidence for contamination in ten of the 40 control villages, and bias possible in self-reported outcomes for diarrhea, HCGI, and open defecation behaviors. ## Conclusions The intervention led to modest increases in availability of IHLs and even more modest reductions in open defecation. These improvements were insufficient to improve child health outcomes (diarrhea, HCGI, parasite infection, anemia, growth). The results underscore the difficulty of achieving adequately large improvements in sanitation levels to deliver expected health benefits within large-scale rural sanitation programs. ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01465204](#) *Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary* # Results ## Enrolment, Baseline Balance, and Attrition [Figure 2](#) depicts the study participants flow. The baseline survey enrolled a sample of 3,390 children <5 years from 1,954 households from 80 villages. In the follow-up survey the sample size was increased to 5,209 children <5 years from 3,039 households. As reported in [Table 2](#), baseline covariates in intervention and control groups were well balanced with four exceptions. First, 89% of the households in the intervention group had access to improved water sources---tap/piped water, tube well and protected dug wells---compared to 80% of households in the control group. In contrast, a larger proportion of control households (54%) were observed to have soap and water at hand-washing locations used after defecation than in intervention households (44%). On average, more children were found to be anemic in the control group (93%) than in the intervention group (88%). Finally, average height-for-age Z-scores were also slightly imbalanced (−1.38 intervention versus −1.81 control). ::::table-wrap

*N* is the base number of observations (the denominator) for the
reported percentages or the sample size used to estimate the reported
means. *N* is the number of households except for the variables measured
at the child level (as indicated by **^b^** and **^c^**) where *N* is
the number of children. *N* varies across different variables because of
measurements in only a subset of the sample by design,
non-response/refusal, and the loss due to measurement errors.

Of the 1,954 households enrolled at the baseline, 1,655 were located at the 21-month follow-up survey (15% attrition) without any significant difference between the intervention (16%) and the control (15%) groups. Characteristics remained balanced between intervention and control groups in remaining households. ## Compliance to Randomization The study measured intervention implementation in multiple ways because of the complexity of the TSC program. These measures included: reported implementation by Block coordinators, expenditure of funds documented by official program records, and interviews with local village officials. Out of 40 intervention villages, staff collected administrative information on 39 villages from the TSC Block coordinators (government officers). The coordinators reported that 15/39 intervention villages received some CLTS activities, 33/39 villages applied for a NGP award prior to the follow-up survey. According to Block coordinators' records, 25/39 villages had 100% households with IHLs, 11/39 villages had 80%--99% households with IHLs, and three of 39 villages with 37%--68% households with IHLs. Block coordinators also reported that 21/39 villages received 100% of the funds allocated under the TSC program, 12/39 villages received between 50% and 99%, and six of 39 villages received <50% of their allocated funds. The latest disbursement of the TSC funds was given to 36/39 intervention villages at least 4 to 5 months before the follow-up survey, which would offer sufficient time for IHLs to be constructed and used for 3 or more months. The study review meetings with Block coordinators also identified that some control villages were contaminated during the study period: TSC activities were initiated in eight control villages within a few months of baseline survey and possibly in two additional control villages a few months prior to the follow-up survey; official records were not available for control villages to ascertain this information objectively. As per the follow-up survey in these ten contaminated villages, the household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities increased from 17.4% at baseline to 41.4% at the follow-up, which is similar to the program effect we observed in the intervention group. The household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities in uncontaminated control villages increased from 10.7% to 16.2% in the same period. The study's long follow-up period (21 months) and the highly publicized and politicized nature of the TSC program may have contributed to this contamination. Information from additional sources (village secretaries, school teachers, *Anganwadi* [pre-school] workers in the village, and the rapid assessment from random sample of households) confirmed that TSC activities translated into a higher recollection and knowledge of the TSC program in the intervention villages compared to the control villages. We also found that households in intervention villages were more aware of CLTS activities, had higher knowledge of TSC, and experienced more personal visits to convince them to build and use IHLs ([Table 3](#)). ::::table-wrap

The number of observations used to estimate means of the intervention
and the control groups is the same as the number of observations used in
ITT-unadjusted analysis.

Explanatory variables in the unadjusted model include the treatment
assignment and indicator variables for Blocks. Therefore, the ITT
effects for outcomes may not be exactly the difference between the
listed mean in intervention and control groups in previous columns.

Because of missing adjustment variables data, the observations used in
adjusted analysis are fewer than those used in unadjusted analysis. The
number of observations used is seven to 113 less than that in unadjusted
analysis.

Following the commonplace norms, statistical significance is indicated
as:

Total Sanitation Campaign/*Nirmal Gram Puraskar*; WASH, water,
sanitation and hygiene.:::: ## IHL Coverage and Sanitation-Related Behaviors [Table 3](#) reports the intervention's effect on IHL availability (JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and any type of IHLs) and open defecation behaviors by household members. The intervention increased the coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facility by average 19 percentage points (95% CI 12%--26%; *p*-value<0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (41.4% intervention versus 22.6% control). The intervention increased the coverage of any type of IHL facility by 20 percentage points (95% CI 13%--27%; *p*-value<0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (44.1% intervention versus 24.2% control). These results indicate that available IHLs were predominantly JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and very few rudimentary latrines or latrines defined as unimproved by the JMP were built. These results are consistent with the TSC design that promoted latrine models that can safely contain the feces. Although on average fewer households in intervention villages were likely to report daily open defecation compared to control villages for adult men (75% intervention versus 84% control; mean difference: 9.5%; *p*-value = 0.001), adult women (73% intervention versus 83% control; mean difference: 10%; *p*-value<0.001), and children <5 years (84% intervention versus 89% control; mean difference: 5%; *p*-value = 0.014), these reductions in reported open defecation behaviors were smaller than the gains in IHL availability. Amongst the 630 households in intervention villages that had JMP defined improved sanitation facilities at follow-up, 41% reported that adult men or women still practiced daily open defecation; this same figure was 28% among the 339 control village households at follow-up (not reported in results table). A follow-up debriefing question to households who had IHL identified that the main reasons for daily open defecation in spite of having IHL were culture, habit, or preference for defecating in open followed by inadequate water availability. ## Drinking Water Quality In control villages, 82% (331/403) of household drinking water samples tested positive for *E. coli* compared to 77% (310/404) of samples in intervention villages (mean difference: 5.5%; *p*-value = 0.050) ([Table 3](#)). [Table S2](#) lists the distribution of positive household samples by different *E. coli* contamination level categories. Of 511 water source samples tested, 74% (208/280) of the sources in control villages and 70% (162/231) in intervention villages tested positive for *E. coli* but the difference was not statistically significant (*p*-value = 0.143). ## Caregiver Reported Illness Diarrhea prevalence did not differ between groups (7.4% intervention versus 7.7% control; *p*-value = 0.687) ([Table 4](#)). HCGI prevalence also did not differ between groups (11.5% intervention versus 12.0% control; *p*-value = 0.692) ([Table 4](#)). We observed no significant differences between groups in negative control caregiver-reported outcomes including bruising/abrasions (1.4% intervention versus 1.3% control) and itchy skin/scalp (2.5% intervention versus 2.2% control) suggesting that differential outcome reporting bias for diarrhea and HCGI was unlikely. ::::table-wrap

defecation.:::: ## Enteric Parasite Infections In the subsample of 1,150 children with stool collection, 5.7% (66/1150) had helminth infections and the majority (50/66) were *Ascaris* infections. All remaining infections were tapeworms; no children were infected with *T. trichiura* or hookworm. We observed no difference in helminth prevalence between intervention and control groups. *Giardia* infection was common, and consistent with slightly improved water quality in the intervention group, we found lower *Giardia* prevalence among children in intervention villages (18%) compared to children in control villages (23%) (mean difference: 4.8%; *p*-value = 0.047). We detected no *Cryptosporidium* infections in the study children, and a low prevalence of *E. histolytica* (33 out of 1,150; 2.9%). ## Anemia and Anthropometry Anemia was prevalent in the study children (54%) and children were small according to international growth standards ([Table 4](#)). However, we found no differences between the randomized groups in anemia prevalence or growth outcomes. ## Subgroup Results [Table 5](#) presents the results of subgroup analyses of the effect of the intervention on households with or without any type of IHL at baseline and BPL or non-BPL households. As expected, the program had the largest improvements on JMP defined improved sanitation facilities, IHL use as assessed by enumerators, and reduced reported open defecation by household members in households that did not have IHL (any type) at baseline and in BPL households. This finding is consistent with the TSC design that targeted households without IHLs and offered larger IHL construction subsidies for BPL households. Among BPL households, the intervention increased JMP defined improved sanitation facilities coverage by 30 percentage points (48% intervention versus 18% control; *p*-value<0.001) and it reduced open defecation among women by 17 percentage points (73% intervention versus 90% control; *p*-value<0.001). Despite larger improvements in these intermediate outcomes among BPL households or households without IHL at baseline, we did not observe consistent improvement in health outcomes in these subgroups ([Table 5](#)). ::::table-wrap

The number of observations used to estimate means of the intervention
and the control groups is the same as the number of observations used in
ITT-unadjusted analysis.

Explanatory variables in the unadjusted model include the treatment
assignment and indicator variables for Blocks. Therefore, the ITT
effects for outcomes may not be exactly the difference between the
listed mean in intervention and control groups in previous columns.

Because of missing adjustment variables data, the observations used in
adjusted analysis are fewer than those used in unadjusted analysis.

Following the commonplace norms, statistical significance is indicated
as:

***significant at α = 0.01;

**significant at α = 0.05;

*significant at α = 0.10.

Please note that *p*-values are not adjusted for multiple comparisons
following guidance from Schulz and Grimes [[43]](#).
