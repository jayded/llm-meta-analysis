Abstract

## Background

Concern that mild iodine deficiency in pregnancy may adversely affect
neurodevelopment of offspring has led to recommendations for iodine
supplementation in the absence of evidence from randomised controlled
trials. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the effect
of iodine supplementation during pregnancy on childhood
neurodevelopment. Secondary outcomes included pregnancy outcomes,
maternal thyroid function and general health.

## Methods

Women with a singleton pregnancy of fewer than 20 weeks were randomly
assigned to iodine (150 μg/d) or placebo from trial entry to birth.
Childhood neurodevelopment was assessed at 18 months by using Bayley
Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III). Iodine status and
thyroid function were assessed at baseline and at 36 weeks' gestation.
Pregnancy outcomes were collected from medical records.

## Results

The trial was stopped after 59 women were randomly assigned following
withdrawal of support by the funding body. There were no differences in
childhood neurodevelopmental scores between the iodine treated and
placebo groups. The mean cognitive, language and motor scores on the
Bayley-III (iodine versus placebo, respectively) were 99.4 ± 12.2 versus
101.7 ± 8.2 (mean difference (MD) −2.3, 95 % confidence interval (CI)
−7.8, 3.2; *P* = 0.42), 97.2 ± 12.2 versus 97.9 ± 11.5 (MD −0.7, 95 % CI
−7.0, 5.6; *P* = 0.83) and 93.9 ± 10.8 versus 92.4 ± 9.7 (MD 1.4, 95 %
CI −4.0, 6.9; *P* = 0.61), respectively. No differences were identified
between groups in any secondary outcomes.

## Conclusions

Iodine supplementation in pregnancy did not result in better childhood
neurodevelopment in this small trial. Adequately powered randomised
controlled trials are needed to provide conclusive evidence regarding
the effect of iodine supplementation in pregnancy.

## Trials registration

The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials
Registry at [http://www.anzctr.org.au](#). The registration number of
this trial is [ACTRN12610000411044](#). The trial was registered on 21
May 2010.

# Results

Of the 645 women approached, 205 met the eligibility criteria. A total
of 59 out of 205 (29 %) women were enrolled in the study from the
Women's & Children's Hospital and the Flinders Medical Centre in
Adelaide, Australia, between June 2010 and October 2010 (Fig. [1](#)).
Twenty-nine were randomly allocated to iodine and 30 to placebo
(Fig. [1](#)). The baseline demographic characteristics of the
participants are listed in Table [1](#). The trial was stopped early,
before recruitment began in other Australian centres and New Zealand,
because the funding body (NHMRC) withdrew its support for the trial. The
NHMRC considered a placebo-controlled trial inconsistent with its
recommendation for iodine supplementation in pregnancy. The ethics
committees did not withdraw approval for the trial, but in view of the
funding body's position it supported the trial management committee's
decision to unblind the study and to follow all randomly assigned women
as planned to monitor safety. Women were informed of their treatment
group allocation and were provided with a copy of the NHMRC
recommendation for iodine supplementation in pregnancy \[[9](#)\]. All
women except two (one from each group) consented to continue with the
follow-up after unblinding. The mean gestational age at unblinding was
33 ± 7 weeks. The mean duration of intervention before unblinding was
16 weeks (range 2--23 weeks). Nine (31 %) women in the iodine group and
4 (13 %) in the placebo group gave birth before unblinding. The decision
regarding whether to continue taking trial supplements or to take
commercially available iodine supplements was at the women's discretion.
Five women in the iodine group and 18 in the placebo group stopped
taking trial supplements. Only one woman in the placebo group commenced
iodine supplements after unblinding.

## Neurodevelopment of children

The mean composite score of the children did not differ between the
iodine and the placebo groups in cognitive (99.4 ± 12.2 versus
101.7 ± 8.2, mean difference (MD): −2.3; 95 % confidence interval (CI)

## Iodine status and thyroid function of mothers and infants

The median (interquartile range) UICs of women at baseline (15 weeks'
gestation) and at 36 weeks' gestation are shown in Fig. [2](#). The UIC
increased from baseline to 36 weeks in the iodine group (median change
(interquartile range) from baseline was 87 (−1 to 134) μg/l,
*P* = 0.001) but not the placebo group (−2 (−76 to 37) μg/l,
*P* = 0.71). The median (interquartile range) breast milk iodine
concentration at 6 weeks after birth was 107 (79--147) μg/l overall, and
there was no difference in breast milk concentration between the iodine
and the placebo group (Table [3](#)). Similarly there were no
differences in cord blood fT3, fT4, TSH and Tg concentration between the
groups (Table [3](#)). Mean TSH of newborn or percentage of newborn with
TSH of more than 5 mU/l from the routine newborn screen test also did
not differ between the groups.

## Pregnancy and other clinical outcomes

The mean birth weight, length, head circumference and gestational age at
birth did not differ between the groups (Table [4](#)). Adjustment for
infant sex did not change the outcome (data not shown). The percentage
of infants classified as low birth weight (\<2500 g) or small for
gestational age or large for gestational age, or with a neonatal
complication or major congenital abnormality, did not differ between the
treatment and placebo groups (Table [4](#)). Other pregnancy outcomes,
including rate of preterm birth, miscarriage, still birth and antenatal
hospital admission, were also not different between the groups
(Table [4](#)).
