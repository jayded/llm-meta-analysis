# Abstract ## Objectives Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of peer-led self-management education in improving glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in a low-income country (Mali). ## Methods We conducted an open-label randomised controlled trial. A total of 151 adults (76% women, mean age 52.5) with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c≥8%), treated in the diabetes consultation units of two secondary health centres in Bamako, were allocated to peer-led structured patient education (n = 76) or conventional care alone (n = 75). The intervention group received 1 year of culturally tailored structured patient education (3 courses of 4 sessions) delivered in the community by five trained peer educators. Both groups underwent conventional diabetes monitoring and follow-up. Primary outcome was the mean absolute change in HbA1c from baseline to 12 months. ## Results 177 education sessions were delivered to the intervention group. Patient attrition was 8%. From baseline to 12 months, the decrease in HbA1c levels was 1.05% (SD = 2.0; CI95%: 1.54;-0.56) in the intervention group compared with 0.15% (SD = 1.7; CI95%: -0.56; 0.26) in the control group, p = 0.006. Mean BMI change was -1.65 kg/m2 (SD = 2.5; CI95%: -2.25; -1.06) in the intervention group and +0.05 kg/m2 (SD = 3.2; CI95%: -0.71; 0.81) in the control group, p = 0.0005. Mean waist circumference decreased by 3.34 cm (SD = 9.3; CI95%: -5.56;-1.13) in the intervention group and increased by 2.65 cm (SD = 10.3; CI95%: 0.20; 5.09) in the control group, p = 0.0003. ## Conclusions Peer-led structured patient education delivered over 1 year to patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in Mali yielded substantial improvements in glycaemic control and anthropometric parameters. This is of importance for the scaling up of efficient interventions in low-resource settings in the future. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01485913](#) # Results From July, 21st to September, 30^th^, 2011, we included 151 patients in the study: 76 in the intervention group and 75 in the control group ([Fig 1](#)). Study participants were mostly female (n = 115, 76.2%) and the majority were overweight (BMI> = 25: n = 110, 72.9%). A third of the sample presented high blood pressure (n = 51, 33.8%). The mean HbA1c level was 10.6% (standard deviation (sd = 1.8) and 10.8% (sd = 1.9) in the intervention arm and the control arm, respectively. At baseline, patients' characteristics in the 2 groups were similar ([Table 1](#)). Educational courses took place between October and December 2011, April and July 2012, August-December 2012. The follow-up of participants from both groups took place between 1^st^ October 2011 and 20 ^th^ February 2013. The reasons for this slight delay in scheduled courses and follow-ups were that due to political events in Mali during 2012 we had to post pone the second and third education session courses in the intervention arm, and the corresponding follow-ups (February 2012, July 2012, January 2013). The patterns of withdrawal are documented in [Fig 1](#). Overall, the 5 PEs facilitated 177 educational sessions with a mean of 6.4 patients per group session in the intervention group. Among intervention patients, 70 attended the 3 courses. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0191262.g001 <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Flow chart of participants.<br /> ST2EP trial.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap

**Combination of 2 OAD: Combination of metformin and sulfonylurea:::: The evolution of HbA1c levels between baseline and 12 months is presented in [Fig 2](#). The decrease in HbA1c levels was more important in the intervention group, especially after month 6. Similarly, the evolution of BMI and WC was more favourable in the intervention group than in the control group (p = 0.001 for BMI and WC; [Fig 3](#)). Patients' knowledge scores improved slightly, mostly due to their increased knowledge of symptoms, treatment and hypoglycaemia management ([Table 4](#)). No positive change in the diet diversity score as a crude index of diet quality was recorded in intervention patients. The number of meals remained the same. However, qualitative changes in the diet were noted from dietary recalls at baseline and at the end of follow-up in the various meals and snacks eaten during the day: meat and fish, as well as peanut and onion sauce, consumption was more abundant at baseline, the number of patients who mentioned having a morning snack decreased by more than half at follow-up, <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0191262.g002 <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Evolution of HbA1c levels between baseline and 12 months–levels in % and 95% confidence interval.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0191262.g003 <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Evolution of body mass index, waist circumference and blood pressure between baseline and 12 months– 95% confidence interval.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap
