Abstract

## Background

Duloxetine, Etoricoxib and opioid are of the commonly administered drugs
in Lumbar laminectomy. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of
perioperative use of Duloxetine in combination with Etoricoxib on
postoperative pain and opioid requirements.

## Methods

One hundred twenty patients with ASA physical status were enrolled with
age between 18 and 70 years. Patients were divided randomly into four
groups of 30 patients: group P received placebo, group E received
etoricoxib 120 mg, group D received duloxetine 60 mg and group D/E
received duloxetine 60 mg capsules and etoricoxib 120 mg; 1 h before
surgery and 24 h after.

## Results

Neither Duloxetine nor etoricoxib individually had effect on pain with
movement, while their combination revealed a significant reduction in
pain scores over the entire postoperative period at rest and on
movement. Etoricoxib showed a significant decrease in pain at all times
at rest when compared with group P, while it showed significant pain
decrease only at 0, 2 and 4 h when compared with group D. On the other
hand duloxetine alone showed significant decrease in pain at rest at
24 h and 48 h when compared with group P. ConcerningMorphine requirement
after 24 h.; it wassignificantly lower in the D/E group in comparison
with groups P, E and D. It should be noted also that there was a
significant decrease morphine requirement in both groups E and D.

## Conclusion

The perioperative administration of the combination of etoricoxib and
duloxetine improved analgesia and reduced opioid consumption without
significant side effects.

## Trial registration

[ ISRCTN48329522](#). 17 June 2017

# Results

From November 1, 2015 to March 1, 2017, 131 consecutive patients who met
the inclusion criteria were allocated for the study (Fig. [1](#)).
Eleven patients refused to participate. Therefore, 120 patients were
randomized and included in the study. Characteristics of patients and
surgical procedures for each group (Table [ 1](#)) showed no significant
differences between the groups.

## The morphine requirement

The time to first rescue analgesic was significantly prolonged in
(D/E)when compared with group D, group E and group P.There was a
significant prolongation when groups E and D were compared with group P
respectively with no significant difference between group E and group D
(Fig. [2](#)).

The morphine requirement at 24 h was statistically different between the
four groups.

. There were significantly increased morphine requirements in the P
group compared with E, D and D/E groups and significantly increased in E
and D groups respectively when compared with D/E group with no
significant difference between group E and group D (Fig. [3](#)). At
48 h, total morphine requirement were still significantly increased in
the P group compared with all groups with significant increases in both
E and D groups when compared with D/E group with no significant
difference between group E and group D (Fig. [4](#)). But it was still
significantly lower in the three groups at 48 h post-surgery when
compared with those required at24 h.

## The pain score

With regard to pain scores at rest all time points, the
duloxetine/etoricoxib (D/E) group had significantly lower pain scores
when compared to placebo group P, while when it compared to etoricoxib
group E, also when compared D/E with duloxetine group D (Table [2](#)).
