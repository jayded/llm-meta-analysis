# Abstract ## Objectives Administering outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in the community setting (CoPAT) is becoming more common with the increasing emphasis on controlling costs. However, few controlled trials have evaluated this treatment modality. ## Methods Using data from a recent randomized trial comparing daptomycin with standard therapy (semi-synthetic penicillin or vancomycin, each with initial low-dose gentamicin) for *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteraemia and infective endocarditis (SAB/IE), patient characteristics and outcomes were evaluated. Patients receiving their full course of therapy in the hospital setting were compared with those who received some portion outside of the hospital (CoPAT). ## Results Among the 200 patients, 51.5% received CoPAT. These patients were generally younger (median age 50 versus 54 years, *P* = 0.028). In the CoPAT group, there tended to be fewer patients with endocardial involvement (8.7% versus 18.6%, *P* = 0.061) and pre-existing valvular heart disease (7.8% versus 15.5%, *P* = 0.120). CoPAT patients received longer therapy courses (mean 25.4 versus 13.5 days, *P* < 0.001) and had higher rates of therapy completion (90.3% versus 45.4%, *P* < 0.001) and clinical success (86.4% versus 55.7%, *P* < 0.001). Persisting or relapsing *S*. *aureus* was less frequent in the CoPAT group (3.9% versus 15.5%, *P* = 0.007) and there were fewer deaths (3.9% versus 18.6%, *P* = 0.001) 6 weeks after the end of therapy. Hospital readmission occurred for 18 of the 103 (17.5%) CoPAT patients. Clinical success rates were similar for CoPAT patients receiving daptomycin (90.0%) or standard therapy (83.0%). ## Conclusions With proper monitoring, stable patients can complete treatment for SAB/IE as outpatients in the community setting. Daptomycin is an appropriate option for this setting. # Results ## Patient characteristics Two hundred US patients were included in this analysis, with 103 (51.5%) receiving part of their treatment outside of the hospital setting (CoPAT). The majority of CoPAT patients (69/103, 67.0%) were discharged home without assistance and two others (1.9%) went home with assistance. Nineteen of the 103 CoPAT patients (18.4%) were discharged to a skilled nursing facility, while 13/103 (12.6%) were treated in an assisted-living setting, nursing home or rehabilitation centre. The study database did not systematically record the types of venous access devices used to deliver CoPAT. In general, peripherally inserted central catheters were the preferred means of securing venous access. Compared with patients who received all care in the hospital, CoPAT patients were younger (median age 50 versus 54 years, *P* = 0.028) and tended to have fewer cases of endocardial involvement (8.7% versus 18.6%; *P* = 0.061) as well as less pre-existing valvular heart disease (7.8% versus 15.5%, *P* = 0.120). The two groups had a similar distribution of diagnoses (Figure [1](#)) and a similar distribution of study medications. Baseline demographic, diagnostic and treatment characteristics are shown in Table [1](#). ::::table-wrap

^a^Comparator treatment was semi-synthetic penicillin/gentamicin or
vancomycin/gentamicin.

^b^No. (%), unless otherwise specified.:::: ## Patient outcomes Among CoPAT patients, clinical success rates were similar regardless of study medication, with 45/50 (90.0%) daptomycin patients and 44/53 (83.0%) comparator patients experiencing clinical success. For IPAT patients, clinical success was observed in 26/50 (52.0%) daptomycin patients and 28/47 (59.6%) comparator patients. Thus, it is justified to combine the treatment groups for analysis of outcomes. CoPAT patients received longer courses of study antibiotics with a mean of 25.4 days (range 9--74 days) compared with 13.5 days (range 1--43) in the IPAT group (*P* < 0.001), and a higher proportion of CoPAT patients completed therapy as part of the study (90.3% versus 45.4%, *P* < 0.001). CoPAT patients received a mean of 14.9 days of therapy outside the hospital setting (Table [1](#)). The shorter duration of study treatment for IPAT patients was influenced by early discontinuations: there were 53 (54.6%) versus 10 (9.7%) in the CoPAT group. The most common reason for discontinuation was adverse events, which accounted for 25/53 (47.2%) IPAT and 8/10 (80.0%) CoPAT patient discontinuations. The adverse events responsible for discontinuation, including rash, infection, renal failure and creatine phosphokinase elevation, are listed in Table [3](#). IPAT patients whose study participation was terminated prior to the end of therapy received subsequent antibiotic therapy as appropriate, but specific information regarding types and duration of additional therapy was not part of the study database. ::::table-wrap

hospital setting.

^a^Inpatients who were partly treated outside a hospital.

^b^Fisher's exact test.

^c^No. (%).:::: ## Escalation of care Twice as many CoPAT patients (22/103, 21.4%) were transferred to a higher level of care during their course of treatment compared with those transferred among IPAT patients (10/97, 10.3%), a difference that reached statistical significance (*P* = 0.036) (Table [5](#)). Hospital readmission was required for 18 of the 103 (17.5%) CoPAT patients. As shown in Table [6](#), the reasons for hospital readmission were diverse. Four patients (22.2% of the readmissions and 3.9% of CoPAT patients) were readmitted for reasons related to their initial infection, including osteomyelitis or relapsed SAB. Problems related to provision of treatment in the post-acute care setting led to the readmission of three patients, two of whom relapsed with iv drug use (IVDU) and one of whom developed *Clostridium difficile* colitis. Other medical conditions leading to readmission included pneumonia in three patients and a myriad of other conditions, including unknown reasons, which were each experienced by a single patient. Of the 18 CoPAT patients readmitted to the hospital during the study, half subsequently returned to treatment in the CoPAT setting. ::::table-wrap

^a^One patient was readmitted twice for reasons relating to treatment at
home.

^b^No. (%).:::: IVDU was associated with an increased risk of hospital readmission for CoPAT patients, with 7/26 (26.9%) IVDU patients requiring readmission, compared with 11/77 (14.3%) non-IVDU patients requiring readmission. The use of iv drugs during therapy was documented in two of the seven readmitted IVDU patients. Also of note was the fact that a higher proportion of patients with right-sided IE (6/19, 31.6%), though not statistically significant, required hospital readmission compared with those with other final diagnoses (Table [6](#)). Five of the six readmitted patients with right-sided IE were iv drug users (four complicated right-sided IE and one uncomplicated right-sided IE).
