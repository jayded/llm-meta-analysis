Abstract

# ABSTRACT

## Objective

The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel- arm
randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of *Lactobacillus
rhamnosus* SP1-containing probiotic sachet and azithromycin tablets as
an adjunct to nonsurgical therapy in clinical parameters and in presence
and levels of *Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis* and
*Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.*

## Material and Methods

Forty-seven systemically healthy volunteers with chronic periodontitis
were recruited and monitored clinically and microbiologically at
baseline for 3, 6 and 9 months after therapy. Subgingival plaque samples
were collected from four periodontal sites with clinical attachment
level ≥1 mm, probing pocket depth ≥4 mm and bleeding on probing, one
site in each quadrant. Samples were cultivated and processed using the
PCR technique. Patients received nonsurgical therapy including scaling
and root planing (SRP) and were randomly assigned to a probiotic (n=16),
antibiotic (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15) group. *L. rhamnosus* SP1 was
taken once a day for 3 months. Azithromycin 500mg was taken once a day
for 5 days.

## Results

All groups showed improvements in clinical and microbiological
parameters at all time points evaluated. Probiotic and antibiotic groups
showed greater reductions in cultivable microbiota compared with
baseline. The placebo group showed greater reduction in number of
subjects with *P. gingivalis* compared with baseline. However, there
were no significant differences between groups.

## Conclusions

The adjunctive use of *L. rhamnosus* SP1 sachets and azithromycin during
initial therapy resulted in similar clinical and microbiological
improvements compared with the placebo group.

# Results

The flow chart of the study is shown in [Figure 1](#). Forty-seven
patients, 16 in the probiotic group, 16 in the antibiotic group and 15
in the placebo group were analyzed. All patients entering the study also
completed it. No compliance problems were noted, all patients followed
the protocol of the study. Only one subject from the antibiotic group
reported an adverse event (nausea).

## Intergroup analysis

At baseline, no significant differences in demographic, medical and
clinical characteristics were found between groups (p\>0.05, [Table
1](#)). Also, there were no intergroup differences in CAL, PPD, BOP,
plaque accumulation, total cultivable microbiota and percentages of *P.
gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans* and *T. forsythia* at 3, 6, and 9
months follow-up ([Table 2](#) and [3](#)).

## Intragroup analysis

The comparison of CAL, PPD, BOP, plaque accumulation values for the
baseline and 3-, 6-, and 9-month time points for all groups are
presented in [Table 2](#). In the probiotic group we observed a
significant reduction of the clinical attachment loss at 3 and 9 months
and of the PPD and plaque accumulation at all times of the follow-up. In
the antibiotic group, we perceived a significant reduction of the CAL
and BOP at 3 and 6 months, as well as a significant reduction of the PPD
and plaque accumulation at all times of the follow-up. Finally, in the
placebo group, the CAL, PPD and plaque accumulation decreased
significantly at all times and the BOP at 3 and 6 months.

Also, we observed a variation of the total cultivable microbiota, as
seen in [Table 2](#). Compared with baseline, there was a significant
reduction in the probiotic group at 6-month follow-up, while for the
antibiotic group it occurred at all times (p\<0.017).

In [Table 3](#), we analyzed the variation of the microbiological
variables between the basal time and the 9-month follow-up. Percentage
of *T. forsythia* and *A. actinomycetemcomitans* is not reported,
because the development of these microorganisms was not observed at any
time of the analysis. The percentage of *P. gingivalis* (p\<0.05)
decreased in all the groups, compared with baseline. The reduction of
the number of subjects with *P. gingivalis* was significant only in the
placebo group (p\<0.05).
