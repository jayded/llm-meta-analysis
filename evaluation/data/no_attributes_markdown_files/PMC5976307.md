# Abstract

## Background and aims:

Recent studies have shown that etomidate is associated with fewer
serious adverse events than propofol and has a noninferior sedative
effect. We investigated whether etomidate--midazolam is associated with
fewer cardiopulmonary adverse events and has noninferior efficacy
compared to propofol--midazolam for screening colonoscopy in the
elderly.

## Methods:

A prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled
trial was performed. Patients aged over 65 years who were scheduled to
undergo screening colonoscopy were randomized to receive either
etomidate or propofol based on midazolam. The primary outcome was all
cardiopulmonary adverse events. The secondary outcomes were vital sign
fluctuation (VSF), adverse events disturbing the procedure, and
sedation-related outcomes.

## Results:

The incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events was higher in the
propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate group (54.8%) (
*P = *.040). VSF was detected in 17 (27.4%) and 31 (50.0%) patients in
the etomidate and propofol groups, respectively ( *P = *.010). The
incidence rate of adverse events disturbing the procedure was
significantly higher in the etomidate group (25.8%) than in the propofol
group (8.1%) (*P = *.008). Moreover, the incidence rate of myoclonus was
significantly higher in the etomidate group (16.1%) than in the propofol
group (1.6%) ( *P = *.004). There was no statistical significance
between the 2 groups with respect to sedation times and sedation-related
outcomes including patients' and endoscopist\'s satisfaction. In the
multivariate analysis, the etomidate group had significantly low odds
ratio (OR) associated with VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval:
0.179--0.926, *P = *.032).

## Conclusions:

We recommend using etomidate--midazolam in patients with high ASA score
or vulnerable to risk factors; propofol--midazolam may be used as a
guideline in patients with low ASA score.

# Results

## Demographic and baseline characteristics

Initially, 130 patients aged over 65 years were assessed. Among them,
six patients were excluded because of adrenocortical insufficiency
(n = 1), desire to undergo endoscopy without sedation (n = 3),
hypersensitivity to the drug (n = 1), or previous history of adverse
events with sedation (n = 1) (Fig. [1](#)). Finally, a total of 124
patients aged over 65 years were enrolled, analyzed, and randomly
assigned to 2 groups: propofol group (n = 62) and etomidate group
(n = 62). The baseline characteristics including age, sex, procedure
type, body mass index, smoking and alcohol history, outpatient status,
anticoagulant use, ASA score, modified Mallampati score, and underlying
diseases were not significantly different in the 2 groups (Table
[1](#)). Additionally, there was no difference in interventional
procedures such as polypectomy (*P* = .773), biopsy ( *P* = .930), and
epinephrine injection ( *P = *.934). Sedation-related outcomes such as
induction time ( *P = *.833), total procedure time ( *P = *.111) and
awake time (*P = *.070) were not different (Table [2](#)).

## Safety-related outcomes

The incidence rate of all cardiopulmonary adverse events was
significantly higher in the propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate
group (54.8%) ( *P = *.040) (Fig. [2](#)). In both groups, there were no
major adverse events including endotracheal intubation, permanent
neurological impairment, and death. The incidence rate of VSF was
significantly higher in the propofol group (50.0%) than in the etomidate
group (27.4%) ( *P = *.010). In addition, the incidence rate of
transient hypotension was significantly higher in the propofol group
(41.9%) than in the etomidate group (24.2%) (*P = *.036). In contrast,
the incidence rate of adverse events disturbing the procedure was
significantly higher in the etomidate group (25.8%) than in the propofol
group (8.1%) (*P = *.008). The incidence rate of myoclonus was
significantly higher in the etomidate group (16.1%) than in the propofol
group (1.6%) (*P = *.004) (Table [3](#)).

When vital sign changes over time were diagrammed on a scatter plot up
to 35 minutes, there was a significant difference in change in median
SBP with passing time between the 2 groups (*P = *.020) (Fig. [3](#)A).
Median HR significantly increased over time, but there was no
significant difference between the 2 groups (Fig. [3](#)B). Median SpO2
was sustained above 98% on 2 L/min oxygen during the procedure. There
was no significant difference over time between the 2 groups (Fig.
[3](#)C).

Multivariate analysis of VSF with logistic regression showed that the
etomidate group had significantly low odds ratio (OR) associated with
VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval: 0.179--0.926, *P = *.032) (Table
[4](#)).

## Efficacy-related outcomes

Outcomes related to the efficacy of sedation including patients'
satisfaction, endoscopist\'s satisfaction, postprocedural abdominal
pain, and postprocedural nausea or vomiting are shown in Table [2](#).
There was no significant difference in patients' satisfaction
(*P = *.130) and endoscopist\'s satisfaction (*P = *.743) between the 2
groups. In addition, differences in patients' postprocedural abdominal
pain ( *P = *.763) and nausea or vomiting ( *P = *.075) between the 2
groups were not statistically significant. Moreover, the frequency of
recall was not significantly different in both the groups (propofol
group: 2/62 \[3.2%\], etomidate group: 5/62 \[8.1%\], *P = *.439).
