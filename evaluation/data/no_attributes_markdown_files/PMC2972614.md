Abstract

## OBJECTIVES:

Conflicting results were reported about the effectiveness of Low level
laser therapy on musculoskeletal disorders. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effectiveness of 850‐nm gallium arsenide aluminum
(Ga‐As‐Al) laser therapy on pain, range of motion and disability in
subacromial impingement syndrome.

## METHODS:

A total of 52 patients (33 females and 19 males with a mean age of
53.59±11.34 years) with subacromial impingement syndrome were included.
The patients were randomly assigned into two groups. Group I (n = 30,
laser group) received laser therapy (5 joule/cm^2^ at each point over
maximum 5‐6 painful points for 1 minute). Group II (n = 22, placebo
laser group) received placebo laser therapy. Initially cold pack
(10 minutes) was applied to all of the patients. Also patients were
given an exercise program including range of motion, stretching and
progressive resistive exercises. The therapy program was applied 5 times
a week for 14 sessions. Pain severity was assessed by using visual
analogue scale. Range of motion was measured by goniometer. Disability
was evaluated by using Shoulder Pain and Disability Index.

## RESULTS:

In group I, statistically significant improvements in pain severity,
range of motion except internal and external rotation and SPADI scores
were observed compared to baseline scores after the therapy (p\<0.05).
In Group II, all parameters except range of motion of external rotation
were improved (p\<0.05). However, no significant differences were
recorded between the groups (p\>0.05).

## CONCLUSIONS:

The Low level laser therapy seems to have no superiority over placebo
laser therapy in reducing pain severity, range of motion and functional
disability.

# RESULTS

Fifty two patients (33 females, 19 males) with a mean age of
53.59±11.34 years with SAIS were included in the study. All patients
were able to complete the therapy program without any adverse effects.
The results of complete blood count, biochemical markers, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate and C‐reactive protein of the patients were found to
be normal.

The sociodemographic and clinic characteristics of the patients were
given in [Table 1](#). No statistically significant differences were
detected between the groups in initial values (p\>0.05).

In group I, after the therapy statistically significant improvements in
pain severity, ROM except internal and external rotation and SPADI
scores were observed compared to baseline scores (p\<0.05).

In Group II, all parameters except ROM of external rotation were
improved (p\<0.05). However, no significant differences were recorded
between the groups (p\>0.05) ([Table 2](#)).
