Abstract

## Background

Increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) is observed in
psoriasis. Metformin has shown improvement in cardiovascular risk
factors while pioglitazone demonstrated anti proliferative,
anti-inflammatory and anti angiogenic effects. Study objective is to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of Insulin sensitizers (metformin and
pioglitazone) in psoriasis patients with metabolic syndrome (MS).

## Methods

Single centre, parallel group, randomized, study of metformin,
pioglitazone and placebo in psoriasis patients with MS.

## Results

Statistically significant improvement was observed in Psoriasis Area and
Severity Index (PASI), Erythema, Scaling and Induration (ESI) and
Physician global assessment (PGA) scores in pioglitazone (*p* values --
PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.002, PGA = 0.008) and metformin groups (*p* values
-- PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.016, PGA = 0.012) as compared to placebo. There
was statistically significant difference in percentage of patients
achieving 75 % reduction in PASI and ESI scores in metformin (*p* value
-- PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.001) and pioglitazone groups (*p* vaue --
PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.001). Significant improvement was observed in
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and triglycerides levels in metformin and
pioglitazone arms. Significant improvement was noted in weight, BMI,
waist circumference, FPG, triglycerides and total cholesterol after
12 weeks of treatment with metformin while pioglitazone showed
improvement in FPG, triglyceride levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP),
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol
levels. There was no difference in pattern of adverse drug reaction in
three groups.

## Conclusion

Insulin sensitizers have shown improvement in the parameters of MS as
well as disease severity in psoriasis patients.

## Trial registration

CTRI Registration Number: [ CTRI/2011/12/002252](#). Registered on
19/12/2011.

# Results

A total of 83 consecutive adult psoriasis patients with MS were screened
from June 2010 to April 2011 (Fig. [1](#)). Out of 83 patients, 23 were
excluded from the study. 23, 16 and 21 patients were randomized to
placebo, pioglitazone and metformin treatment groups respectively.
Disposition of patients and reasons for withdrawal were summarized in
Fig. [1](#). Hence, 21 patients in placebo arm, 16 in pioglitazone and
18 patients in metformin arm completed the study. As Intention to treat
analysis with last observation carry forward (LOCF) was done, so all the
subjects as randomized were included for final analysis.

No significant difference was observed in baseline demographics and MS
characteristics among three treatment groups except past history of
remission (Table [1](#)).

## ESI and PGA scores and parameters of Metabolic Syndrome (MS)

Statistically significant improvement was observed in PASI, ESI and PGA
scores in pioglitazone (*P* values -- PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.002,
PGA = 0.008) and metformin groups ( *P* values -- PASI = 0.001,
ESI = 0.016, PGA = 0.012) as compared to placebo (Fig. [2](#)). There
was statistically significant difference in percentage of parameters of
MS improved following 12 weeks of treatment in pioglitazone (15 %) and
metformin (16.2 %) groups as compared to placebo (3.5 %) (Fig. [3](#)).
Statistically significant difference in percentage of patients achieving
75 % reduction in PASI and ESI scores in metformin (*p* value --
PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.001) and pioglitazone groups (*p* value --
PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.001) (Fig. [4](#)). Statistically significant
improvement is observed in FPG, total cholesterol and triglycerides
levels (Table [2](#)) in metformin and pioglitazone arms as compared to
placebo. Significant improvement was also observed in percentage of
patients achieving 75 % reduction in PGA scores (Fig. [4](#)) and change
in weight and waist circumference in metformin group as compared to
placebo (Table [2](#)). Significant improvement was observed in weight,
BMI, waist circumference, FPG, triglycerides and total cholesterol after
treatment with metformin (Table [2](#)). Similarly improvement was seen
in FPG, triglyceride levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels after
treatment with pioglitazone for 12 weeks (Table [2](#)). No significant
change in the IL-6 and TNF-α levels among three groups (Fig. [5](#)).
