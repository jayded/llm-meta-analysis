Abstract

## Background

During laparoscopy, insufflation of an inert gas in the peritoneal
cavity creates a working space to facilitate surgery. The space should
be large enough to facilitate surgery without increasing intra-abdominal
pressure (IAP) over a threshold limit (usually 15 mm Hg).

## Objectives

This experimental study was performed to evaluate the effects of
increasing in intra-abdominal pressure on internal organs.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty female mixed breed dogs (20 ± 3 kg, 18 ± 1.2 months) were
selected. They were randomly divided to two groups (n = 10). The
intra-abdominal pressure was maintained 12 mm Hg and 20 mm Hg during the
operation in control group and in test group respectively.

## Results

Histopathologic evaluations revealed more pathological changes at the
kidney of all the dogs in test group in comparison to control group.

## Conclusions

Our findings revealed that organs that their blood supplies are related
to one single or two arteries and their blood drainage are related to
one or two veins are more sensitive to increased intra-abdominal
pressure.

# 4. Results

There were no differences between dogs in body weight, age and the
procedure of general anesthesia. In heart rate evaluation at equal
intervals, no significant differences were observed over time between
the two groups. Also in respiratory rate, there were no significant
differences (P\>0.05). Results of end tidal CO ~2~ measurements did not
show severe hypoventilation during anesthesia in both groups. Comparison
of this data between groups did not show any significant difference (P
\> 0.05). The mean of hemoglobin saturation measurements in the two
groups did not show any significant difference (P \> 0.05).

Histopathologic evaluations revealed pathological changes at the kidney
of all the dogs in test group (intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg) (
[Figure 1](#) ) in comparison to control group (intra-abdominal
pressure: 12 mm Hg) ( [Figure 2](#) ). These pathological changes
included: coagulation necrosis, glomerulonephritis and fatty changes.
Fatty changes were stronger at distal tubules in comparison with
proximal tubules.

The pathologic changes at the liver were similar in both groups and were
mild. These changes included mild coagulation necrosis in the
parenchyma, hyperplasia at the smooth muscles and congestion. The
differences between two groups were not significant. The pathologic
change that was significant in test group at the pancreases was acinar
necrosis. This change was observed only in samples of test group. Any
pathologic change at the spleen was not detected in two groups.
