<abstract><sec><title>OBJECTIVE</title><p>After intensive insulin treatment, many obese African American patients with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hyperglycemia are able to achieve near-normoglycemia remission. The optimal treatment to prevent hyperglycemic relapses after remission is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, 4-year, placebo-controlled study randomly assigned 48 African American subjects with DKA and severe hyperglycemia to metformin 1,000 mg daily (<italic>n</italic> = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg daily (<italic>n</italic> = 16), or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 15) after normoglycemia remission. Hyperglycemic relapse was defined as fasting glucose &gt;130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &gt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at randomization and at 3 months and then every 6 months for a median of 331 days. Oral minimal model and incremental area under the curve for insulin (AUCi) were used to calculate insulin sensitivity (Si) and β-cell function, respectively. Disposition index (DI) was calculated as a product of Si and incremental AUCi.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Relapse-free survival was higher in sitagliptin and metformin (<italic>P</italic> = 0.015) compared with placebo, and mean time to relapse was significantly prolonged in the metformin and sitagliptin groups compared with the placebo group (480 vs. 305 days, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004). The probability of relapse was significantly lower for metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10–0.81]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10–0.98]) than for placebo. Subjects who remained in remission had a higher DI (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) than those with hyperglycemia relapse without significant changes in Si.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study shows that near-normoglycemia remission was similarly prolonged by treatment with sitagliptin and metformin. The prolongation of remission was due to improvement in β-cell function.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>Forty-eight African American subjects with DKA (<italic>n</italic> = 22) and severe hyperglycemia (<italic>n</italic> = 26) were included in the study. Seventeen subjects were randomly assigned to metformin 1,000 mg daily, 16 to sitagliptin 100 mg daily, and 15 to placebo. Four subjects in the metformin group, 6 in the sitagliptin group, and 1 in the placebo group were lost to follow-up. One subject in the sitagliptin group and one subject in the placebo group withdrew from the study. The overall median follow-up after insulin discontinuation was 331 days (interquartile range 102, 612 days) with no differences between randomized groups (<xref>Table 1</xref>). The subjects lost to follow-up or who withdrew from the study were in near-normoglycemia remission during their last documented study visit. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics at presentation between subjects who withdrew and those who stayed in the study, except for HbA<sub>1c</sub>. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was lower at presentation of DKA/hyperglycemia in subjects who withdrew compared with those who stayed (12.0 ± 2.3% [107 ± 25 mmol/mol] vs. 13.5 ± 2.0% [124 ± 22 mmol/mol],

Because only a small number of subjects experienced relapse in the medication groups (metformin [<italic>n</italic> = 5], sitagliptin [<italic>n</italic> = 4]) compared with placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 11), we combined the metformin and sitagliptin groups. There were no significant differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (8.0 ± 0.8% [64 ± 9 mmol/mol] vs. 8.2 ± 1.5% [66 ± 16 mmol/mol], <italic>P</italic> = 0.79) or blood glucose (152 ± 18 mg/dL [8.4 ± 1 mmol/L] vs. 160 ± 68 mg/dL [8.9 ± 3.8 mmol/L], <italic>P</italic> = 0.65) levels at the time of hyperglycemia relapse between the placebo group and the combined metformin and sitagliptin group.
