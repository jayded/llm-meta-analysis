<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Spinal fusion surgery is associated with significant blood loss, which may result in potential clinical complications, it is necessary to take safe and effective measures to reduce blood loss in surgery. We perform this study to assess the impact of three different hemostatic materials on perioperative blood loss.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a Randomized Controlled Trial research and recruited patients with lumbar disease into the study between November 2013 and March 2015. All the participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups using a simple equal probability randomization scheme: Group A (Stypro hemostatic sponge), Group B (Collagen hemostatic sponge) and Group C (gelatin sponge). We compared postoperative blood loss between these 3 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In our study, drainage volume in the first 24 h of patients in Group A and B is significantly smaller, as well as total postoperative volumes of drainage (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) during their hospital stay. The drainage volumes in the second 24 h were similar in the 3 groups. We also found that the average drainage Hematocrit (HCT) reduced over time, the average HCT of drainage is 18.04% and 11.72% on the first day and on the second day respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hemostatic collagen sponge demonstrated better hemostasis effects than gelatin sponge with lower volume of postoperative drainage volume and blood loss in posterior spinal fusion surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial registration number (TRN) of the study is <ext-link>ISRCTN29254316</ext-link> and date of registration is 25/10/2016.

No significant difference in age, height, weight, BMI, surgical level, intraoperative blood loss, operative durations, the mean length of hospital stay and coagulation indices were identified between the 3 groups, as presented in Table <xref>1</xref>.<table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic date</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Group A</th><th>Group B</th><th>Group C</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>N</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Age (year)</td><td>56.1 ± 12.9</td><td>55.6 ± 12.3</td><td>56.7 ± 13.4</td></tr><tr><td>Sex</td></tr><tr><td> Males</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td> Females</td><td>18</td><td>17</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>BMI (kg/cm2)</td><td>24.83 ± 3.6</td><td>24.93 ± 3.3</td><td>24.81 ± 3.4</td></tr><tr><td>Preoperative HGB (g/L)</td><td>123.2 ± 10.5</td><td>125.1 ± 9</td><td>126.4 ± 8.4</td></tr><tr><td>Surgical level</td><td>2.31 ± 0.09</td><td>2.76 ± 0.12</td><td>2.40 ± 0.10</td></tr><tr><td>Operative time (min)</td><td>118.0 ± 24</td><td>150.6 ± 47</td><td>135.6 ± 39</td></tr><tr><td>Blood loss (ml)</td><td>202.5 ± 25</td><td>292.7 ± 39</td><td>259.8 ± 37</td></tr><tr><td>Mean duration of hospital stay (days)</td><td>6.82 ± 1.2</td><td>6.89 ± 1.3</td><td>7.3 ± 1.3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The detailed information of drainage at various time points is presented in Table <xref>2</xref> and Fig. <xref>2</xref>.
