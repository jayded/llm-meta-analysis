<abstract><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To determine abnormal MRI findings in adults hospitalized with acute severe axial LBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Sixty patients with back pain were divided into 3 groups consisting of 1) 23 adults with acute axial severe LBP who could not sit up or stand up for several days, but had not experienced previous back-related diseases or trauma (group A), 2) 19 adults who had been involved in a minor traffic accident, and had mild symptoms but not limited mobility (group B), and 3) 18 adults with LBP with radicular pain (group C)., Various MRI findings were assessed among the above 3 groups and compared as follows: disc herniation (protrusion, extrusion), lumbar disc degeneration (LDD), annular tear, high intensity zone (HIZ), and endplate changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The MRI findings of A group were as follows: disc herniation (87%), LDD (100%), annular tear (100%), HIZ (61%), and end plate changes (4.4%). The findings of disc herniation, annular tear, HIZ, and LDD were more prevalent in A group than in B group (p&lt;0.01). HIZ findings were more prevalent in A group than in group B or group C (p&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with acute severe axial LBP were more likely to have disc herniation, LDD, annular tear, HIZ. Among LBP groups, there was a significant association of HIZ on MRI with acute severe axial LBP.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The frequencies of the MRI findings were as follows: In patients with acute lower back pain (group A), disc herniation (87%), LDD (100%), annular tear (100%), HIZ (61%), and Modic change (4.4%); in patients with mild lower back pain caused by a simple vehicle accident (control group B), disc herniation (31.6%), LDD (47.4%), annulus tear (26.3%), HIZ (21.1%), and Modic change (10.5%); and in patients with severe radiating lower back pain (control group C), disc herniation (100%), LDD (100%), annulus tear (94.4%), HIZ (16.7%), and Modic changes (27.7%) (<xref>Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In all groups, (80%) of the disc changes were in L4-5 and L5-S1 (<xref>Table 2</xref>). There were significant differences in the disc herniation, HDD, annulus tear, and HIZ between the patients with acute severe lower back pain (group A) and the control group B (p&lt;0.05) (<xref>Table 3</xref>). The proportion of HIZ incidence was significantly higher in group A than in control group B, and in the patients with severe radiating pain (control group C) (p&lt;0.05) (<xref>Table 3</xref>). It was difficult to give clinical meaning to the Modic change, as its frequency was low.</p></sec><fig><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Magnetic resonance images of high intensity zone (HIZ), (A) The sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance image showing a HIZ (arrow) within the posterior annulus at L5-S1, (B) The axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance image shows a HIZ (arrow) within the posterior annulus at L5-S1.</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><fig><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Magnetic resonance images of lumbar disc degeneration (LDD).
