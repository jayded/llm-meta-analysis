<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic work-related stress is an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases and associated mortality, particularly when compounded by a sedentary work environment. The purpose of this study was to determine if an office worksite-based <italic>hatha</italic> yoga program could improve physiological stress, evaluated <italic>via</italic> heart rate variability (HRV), and associated health-related outcomes in a cohort of office workers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-seven adults employed in university-based office positions were randomized upon the completion of baseline testing to an experimental or control group. The experimental group completed a 10-week yoga program prescribed three sessions per week during lunch hour (50 min per session). An experienced instructor led the sessions, which emphasized <italic>asanas</italic> (postures) and <italic>vinyasa</italic> (exercises). The primary outcome was the high frequency (HF) power component of HRV. Secondary outcomes included additional HRV parameters, musculoskeletal fitness (i.e. push-up, side-bridge, and sit &amp; reach tests) and psychological indices (i.e. state and trait anxiety, quality of life and job satisfaction).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All measures of HRV failed to change in the experimental group versus the control group, except that the experimental group significantly increased LF:HF (p = 0.04) and reduced pNN50 (p = 0.04) versus control, contrary to our hypotheses. Flexibility, evaluated <italic>via</italic> sit &amp; reach test increased in the experimental group versus the control group (p &lt; 0.001). No other adaptations were noted. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analysis comparing participants who completed ≥70% of yoga sessions (n = 11) to control (n = 19) yielded the same findings, except that the high adherers also reduced state anxiety (p = 0.02) and RMSSD (p = 0.05), and tended to improve the push-up test (p = 0.07) versus control.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A 10-week <italic>hatha</italic> yoga intervention delivered at the office worksite during lunch hour did not improve HF power or other HRV parameters. However, improvements in flexibility, state anxiety and musculoskeletal fitness were noted with high adherence. Future investigations should incorporate strategies to promote adherence, involve more frequent and longer durations of yoga training, and enrol cohorts who suffer from higher levels of work-related stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link>ACTRN12611000536965</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Flow of participants</title><p>Forty-two individuals (n = 42) expressed an interest in the study, and were deemed eligible; five withdrew prior to baseline testing with reasons presented in Figure <xref>1</xref>. Thirty-seven individuals provided written informed consent, completed baseline testing, and were randomized to the yoga (n = 18) or control group (n = 19). One participant in the yoga group withdrew in week 2 for personal reasons, while two in the control group failed to complete follow-up testing.

No statistically significant differences were observed between groups at baseline on the descriptive characteristics presented. However, due to potentially clinically important differences in BMI (p = 0.09), this variable was included as a covariate in all ANCOVA models. The cohort ranged in age from 21 to 58 years. BMI ranged from 18.3 to 39.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and seven participants fulfilled the clinical criteria for obesity (i.e. BMI ≥30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Two participants were current smokers, while one had a history of tobacco use but did not currently smoke. Other than obesity, the most common chronic conditions were asthma (n = 4), hypercholesterolemia (n = 4) and hypertension (n = 5). None of the participants were presently engaged in regular yoga practice but nearly half had prior experience at a beginner level (17/37, 46%). The majority of participants were administrative staff, technical support staff, or post-graduate students.</p><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the total cohort and groups</p></caption><table><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th><bold>Characteristic</bold></th><th><bold>Total cohort (n = 37)</bold></th><th><bold>Yoga group (n = 18)</bold></th><th><bold>Control group (n = 19)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age (y) <hr/></td><td>38 ± 12 <hr/></td><td>37 ± 12 <hr/></td><td>39 ± 13 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Women:Men <hr/></td><td>30:7 <hr/></td><td>14:4 <hr/></td><td>16:3 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Body weight (kg) <hr/></td><td>68.6 ± 11.8 <hr/></td><td>68.1 ± 10.7 <hr/></td><td>69.1 ± 13.0 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Height (cm) <hr/></td><td>165 ± 9 <hr/></td><td>167 ± 9 <hr/></td><td>163 ± 7 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Body Mass Index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) <hr/></td><td>25.3 ± 4.8 <hr/></td><td>24.4 ± 4.0 <hr/></td><td>26.1 ± 5.6 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) <hr/></td><td>121 ± 12 <hr/></td><td>122 ± 14 <hr/></td><td>121 ± 9 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) <hr/></td><td>79 ± 10 <hr/></td><td>79 ± 11 <hr/></td><td>80 ± 8 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Occupation (n): <hr/></td><td>  <hr/></td><td>  <hr/></td><td>  <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>• Administrative staff <hr/></td><td>13 <hr/></td><td>7 <hr/></td><td>6 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>• Technical support <hr/></td><td>10 <hr/></td><td>4 <hr/></td><td>6 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>• Post-graduate student <hr/></td><td>8 <hr/></td><td>3 <hr/></td><td>5 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>• Academic staff <hr/></td><td>5 <hr/></td><td>3 <hr/></td><td>2 <hr/></td></tr><tr><td>• Research staff</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data presented as mean ± standard deviation.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Correlations between measures of HRV at baseline</title><p>Correlation coefficients relating to measures of HRV in the total cohort at baseline, after normalization of data, are presented in Table <xref>2</xref>.
