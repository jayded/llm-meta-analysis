<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Limited information has been published regarding how specific processes for event adjudication can affect event rates in trials. We reviewed nonfatal myocardial infarctions (MIs) reported by site investigators in the international Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin (Eptifibatide) Therapy (PURSUIT) trial and those adjudicated by a central clinical events committee (CEC) to determine the reasons for differences in event rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The PURSUIT trial randomised 10,948 patients with acute coronary syndromes to receive eptifibatide or placebo. The primary end-point was death or post-enrolment MI at 30 days as assessed by the CEC; this end-point was also constructed using site-reported events. The CEC identified suspected MIs by systematic review of clinical, cardiac enzyme, and electrocardiographic data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The CEC identified 5005 (46%) suspected events, of which 1415 (28%) were adjudicated as MI. The site investigator and CEC assessments of whether a MI had occurred disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients with suspected MI, mostly reflecting site misclassification of post-enrolment MIs (as enrolment MIs) or underreported periprocedural MIs. Patients for whom the CEC and site investigator agreed that no end-point MI had occurred had the lowest mortality at 30 days and between 30 days and 6 months, and those with agreement that a MI had occurred had the highest mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CEC adjudication provides a standard, systematic, independent, and unbiased assessment of end-points, particularly for trials that span geographic regions and clinical practice settings. Understanding the review process and reasons for disagreement between CEC and site investigator assessments of MI is important to design future trials and interpret event rates between trials.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Incidence of disagreement</title><p>Overall, 5005 (46%) patients with possible or suspected MI were identified and adjudicated by the CEC. The CEC identified more patients with end-point events than did the site investigators (13.6% versus 7.7% for placebo, 12.6% versus 6.2% for eptifibatide). The CEC and site investigator assessments of MI disagreed for 9% of all patients enrolled in the PURSUIT trial. The CEC identified MIs in 1415 of the 5005 patients with suspected MI. The site investigator and the CEC assessments disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients. Of these 983 patients with disagreements, 816 patients had a MI identified by the CEC but not the site investigator, and 167 patients had a MI identified by site investigator but not the CEC. The proportion of patients with disagreement was similar among regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Reasons for disagreement</title><p>Most often, when the site investigator had identified a MI and the CEC had not, the investigator had misclassified a MI at enrolment as an end-point MI, although by protocol these were not end-point events (Table <xref>1</xref>). Recurrent ischemic events without elevated cardiac enzymes or ECG evidence of MI were also incorrectly identified by site investigators as MIs (Table <xref>1</xref>). In cases where the CEC had identified a MI and the site investigators had not, one-third of those identified were MIs defined by enzyme elevations without clinical or ECG evidence of ischemia or infarction (Table <xref>2</xref>). Enzyme elevations after bypass surgery accounted for 25% of these cases. Patients with clinically evident ischemia reported by the site investigator and associated with cardiac enzyme elevations were not reported as MIs by investigators in 27% of the cases of disagreement (Table <xref>2</xref>). Few infarctions based on new Q waves without clinical evidence of reinfarction were identified by the CEC and not by site investigators.</p><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Myocardial infarctions identified by site investigators but not confirmed by the clinical events committee</p></caption><table><thead><tr><td></td><td>Eastern Europe</td><td>Latin America</td><td>North America</td><td>Western Europe</td><td>Overall</td></tr><tr><td>Clinical scenario</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 24)</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 8)</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 57)</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 78)</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 167)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Enrolment myocardial infarction<sup>*</sup></td><td>8 (33)</td><td>4 (50)</td><td>24 (42)</td><td>28 (36)</td><td>64 (38)</td></tr><tr><td>Ischemic event without infarction<sup>†</sup></td><td>7 (29)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>8 (14)</td><td>19 (24)</td><td>34 (20)</td></tr><tr><td>Peri-death infarction<sup>‡</sup></td><td>6 (25)</td><td>2 (25)</td><td>13 (23)</td><td>8 (10)</td><td>29 (17)</td></tr><tr><td>Percutaneous coronary intervention related</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (12.5)</td><td>6 (11)</td><td>10 (13)</td><td>17 (10)</td></tr><tr><td>Coronary artery bypass surgery related</td><td>2 (8)</td><td>1 (12.5)</td><td>5 (9)</td><td>7 (9)</td><td>15 (9)</td></tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous</td><td>1 (4)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>6 (8)</td><td>8 (5)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data presented as <italic>n</italic> (%). <sup>*</sup> Not an end-point event per protocol. <sup>†</sup> Clinical evidence of ischemia without electrocardiography (ECG) or cardiac enzyme evidence of infarction. <sup>‡</sup> Infarction suspected at the time of death without supporting clinical, ECG, or cardiac enzyme data.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Myocardial infarctions identified by the clinical events committee but not the site investigator</p></caption><table><thead><tr><td></td><td>Eastern Europe</td><td>Latin America</td><td>North America</td><td>Western Europe</td><td>Overall</td></tr><tr><td>Clinical scenario</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 182)</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 44)</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 299)</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 291)</td><td>(<italic>n</italic> = 816)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Asymptomatic CK-MB elevation<sup>*</sup></td><td>83 (46)</td><td>23 (52)</td><td>37 (12)</td><td>128 (44)</td><td>271 (33)</td></tr><tr><td>Ischemic event<sup>†</sup></td><td>89 (49)</td><td>12 (27)</td><td>48 (16)</td><td>68 (23)</td><td>217 (27)</td></tr><tr><td>Coronary artery bypass graft-related</td><td>6 (3)</td><td>6 (14)</td><td>138 (46)</td><td>52 (18)</td><td>202 (25)</td></tr><tr><td>PCI-related</td><td>2 (1)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>62 (21)</td><td>22 (8)</td><td>87 (11)</td></tr><tr><td>Early myocardial infarction<sup>‡</sup></td><td>1 (1)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>3 (1)</td><td>3 (1)</td><td>7 (1)</td></tr><tr><td>Isolated electrocardiogram (Q waves)<sup>§</sup></td><td>1 (1)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>5 (2)</td><td>4 (1)</td><td>11 (1)</td></tr><tr><td>Peri-death<sup>¶</sup></td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>1 (0.3)</td><td>4 (1)</td><td>6 (1)</td></tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>5 (2)</td><td>10 (3)</td><td>15 (2)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data presented as <italic>n</italic> (%).
