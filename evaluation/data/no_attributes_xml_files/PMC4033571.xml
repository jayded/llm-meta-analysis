<abstract><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of once-daily 1200 mg and 2400 mg SPN-804 (Oxtellar XR™, Supernus Pharmaceuticals), an extended-release tablet formulation of oxcarbazepine (OXC), added to 1-3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in adults with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Prospective, Randomized Study of OXC XR in Subjects with Partial Epilepsy Refractory (PROSPER) study was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 3 study. The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly (28-day) seizure frequency for the 16-week double-blind treatment period in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with analyzable seizure data. Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50% seizure reduction, proportion of patients seizure free, and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, −38.2% (<italic>P </italic>=<italic> </italic>0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and −42.9% (<italic>P </italic>=<italic> </italic>0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg. Responder rates were 28.1%, 36.1% (<italic>P </italic>=<italic> </italic>0.08), and 40.7% (<italic>P </italic>=<italic> </italic>0.02); 16-week seizure-free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3%, 4.9% (<italic>P </italic>=<italic> </italic>0.59), and 11.4% (<italic>P </italic>=<italic> </italic>0.008), respectively. When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters, a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: −13.3%; 1200 mg: −34.5%, <italic>P </italic>=<italic> </italic>0.02; 2400 mg: −52.7%, <italic>P </italic>=<italic> </italic>0.006) in the North American study site cluster. A concentration–response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg. Adverse event types reflected the drug's established profile. Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate-release OXC. Once-daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adjunctive once-daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures. Adverse event occurrence and discontinuations due to adverse events suggest improved tolerability vs previously published data with immediate-release OXC.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient disposition and characteristics</title><p>Of 440 patients screened, 366 patients were randomized to once-daily placebo (<italic>n </italic>=<italic> </italic>121), SPN-804 1200 mg (<italic>n </italic>=<italic> </italic>122), and SPN-804 2400 mg (<italic>n </italic>= 123). Analyzable seizure data for the primary efficacy analysis were available for 96.7% (<italic>n </italic>=<italic> </italic>117), 89.3% (<italic>n </italic>=<italic> </italic>109), and 90.3% (<italic>n </italic>=<italic> </italic>111), respectively (Fig. <xref>1</xref>). Of the 111 patients in the 2400-mg group with analyzable seizure data, 26 were patients in whom SPN-804 was down-titrated to 1800 mg/day. Overall, 67.8% of patients completed 16 weeks, with 21.5% of placebo patients discontinuing prematurely compared with 32.8% and 42.3% in the 1200-mg and 2400-mg SPN-804 groups, respectively. The most common reason for study withdrawal was adverse events, accounting for the higher discontinuation rates in the active treatment groups. Based on pill counts, 96.0% (placebo), 93.2% (1200 mg), and 95.1% (2400 mg) of patients were adherent with once-daily dosing.</p><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study disposition for patients assigned to placebo or Oxtellar XR (SPN-804).</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><p>Treatment groups were generally well balanced in terms of baseline demographics and disease characteristics (Table <xref>1</xref>).
