<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>The effect of dietary calcium on fecal fat excretion in lactose maldigestion is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To investigate the effect of dairy and nondairy dietary calcium on fecal fat excretion in lactose digesters and maldigesters during moderate energy restriction.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A randomized cross-over trial comparing the effect of 500 mg vs. 1500 mg dairy and nondairy calcium on fecal fat excretion in 34 healthy adults during moderate (− 30%) energy restriction diet-induced weight loss for 12 weeks.

One participant was dropped due to noncompliance, and five withdrew between week 1 and week 8. Baseline and end of the study characteristics of participants who completed the study are shown in <xref>Table 1</xref>. There was no difference in initial weight and body composition between lactose maldigesters and digesters and between dairy and nondairy diets (all <italic> P</italic> &gt;0.05).</p><sec><title>Dietary intake and compliance with the study diets</title><p>The participants had an average energy intake of 7.5 ± 1.5 MJ (<xref>Table 2</xref>). The average intake of energy from carbohydrates, fat, and protein was 54.5 ± 3.0%, 28.9 ± 2.6%, and 18.4 ± 1.85%, respectively. There were no differences between macronutrient and fiber content between the diets (dairy vs. nondairy). Average amount of calcium in low-Ca and high-Ca diets was 503 ± 73 and 1491 ± 131 mg/day, respectively and the level was not different between dairy and nondairy diets. There were no significant differences between the intake of protein, sodium, and potassium and their respective biological markers in weekly urine collections. Ratio of nitrogen in urine and corresponding protein intake were not significantly different between the dairy and nondairy diets (1.13 ± 0.41 and 1.01 ± 0.14, <italic>P</italic> = 0.105). There were also no differences between the ratios of reported intake and excretion between dairy and nondairy diets for sodium (0.96 ± 0.20 and 0.95 ± 0.19, <italic>P</italic> = 0.917) and potassium (1.15 ± 0.23 and 1.12 ± 0.16, <italic>P</italic> = 0.684).</p></sec><sec><title>Fecal fat excretion</title><p>The average fecal fat loss (<xref>Table 3</xref>) over 6 weeks was significantly higher with high-Ca diet than that with low-Ca diet after adjusting for gender, lactose digestion status, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 3.0%; the 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3 to 3.7%; <italic> P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The fecal fat loss increased correspondingly with cross-over to high-Ca diet and vice versa (<xref>Figure 1</xref>). It was also significantly higher in females than that in males after adjusting for calcium intake level, lactose digestion status, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 2.0%; the 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.9%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in fecal fat loss between lactose digesters and maldigesters (<xref>Figure 2</xref>) after adjusting for gender, calcium intake level, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 0.2%; the 95% CI: −0.5 to 1.0%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.544). There was a significant positive correlation between calcium intake and fecal fat excretion in dairy (r = 0.460) and nondairy (r = 0.555) diets and in lactose digesters (r = 0.562) and maldigesters (r = 0.463, all <italic>P</italic> &gt;0.05). Although not statistically significant, the average fecal fat loss over 12 weeks was higher in nondairy than that in dairy diet group (<xref>Figure 1</xref>) after adjusting for calcium intake level, lactose digestion status and gender (mean: 0.5%; the 95% CI: −0.2 to 1.2%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.150). In females, the average fecal fat loss over 6 weeks tended to be higher with the non-dairy than that with the dairy diet after adjusting for calcium intake level and lactose digestion status (mean: 0.8%; the 95% CI: −0.1 to 1.6%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.067).</p></sec><sec><title>Urinary calcium excretion</title><p>Urinary calcium excretion (<xref>Table 4</xref>) was significantly higher in high-Ca than low-Ca (128.3± 57.9 and 146.4 ± 77.9 mg/day<sup>−1</sup>; the 95% CI for difference: 3.8 to 31.1 mg/day; <italic>P</italic> = 0.014).

However, there were significant differences in weight changes in lactose digesters vs. maldigesters (9.2 ± 2.2 and 6.6 ± 2.4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003). There was also significant differences between first and second 6-week study periods (5.6± 1.8 and 2.8 ± 1.7 kg, <italic>P</italic>= 0.001).

There were also no significant differences in body fat changes across groups, dairy vs. nondairy (5.4 ± 1.5 and 4.1 ± 1.5; <italic>P</italic> = 0.393) or lactose digesters vs. maldigesters (5.5 ± 1.3 vs. 4.8 ± 1.7; <italic>P</italic> = 0.206). There were also no differences in the amount of total body water between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Resting energy expenditure (REE) and physical activity</title><p>There was a difference in REE between the baseline and the end of the study (7.31±1.31 vs. 6.74 ± 1.32 MJ) which became insignificant when REE was adjusted for fat free mass and fat mass (data not shown). There were not REE differences between digesters and maldigesters (<xref>Table 6</xref>). The differences in the amount of physical activity measured using RT3 accelerometers during the entire study were also not significant.
