<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>BTH1677, a beta-glucan pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule, drives an anti-cancer immune response in combination with oncology antibody therapies. This phase II study explored the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of BTH1677 combined with bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were randomized to the BTH1677 arm (<italic>N</italic> = 61; intravenous [IV] BTH1677, 4 mg/kg, weekly; IV bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg, once each 3-week cycle [Q3W]; IV carboplatin, 6 mg/mL/min Calvert formula area-under-the-curve, Q3W; and IV paclitaxel, 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, Q3W) or Control arm (<italic>N</italic> = 31; bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel as above). Carboplatin/paclitaxel was discontinued after 4-6 cycles and patients who responded or remained stable received maintenance therapy with BTH1677/bevacizumab (BTH1677 arm) or bevacizumab (Control arm). Efficacy assessments, based on blinded central radiology review, included objective response rate (ORR; primary endpoint), disease control rate, duration of objective response, and progression-free survival. Overall survival and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>ORR was higher in the BTH1677 vs Control arm but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (60.4% vs 43.5%; <italic>P</italic> = .2096). All other clinical endpoints also favored the BTH1677 arm but none statistically differed between arms. PK was consistent with previous studies. Although a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in the BTH1677 vs Control arm (93.2% vs 66.7%), no unexpected AEs were observed. Serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were lower in the BTH1677 vs Control arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Improvements in tumor assessments and survival were observed with BTH1677/bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel compared with control treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov registration ID: <ext-link> NCT00874107</ext-link>.

As shown in Fig. <xref>1</xref>, 59 patients in the BTH1677 arm and 30 patients in the Control arm were treated and included in the safety and survival analyses. The blinded central radiology review primary efficacy population included 50 patients (48 patients response evaluable) in the BTH1677 arm and 23 patients in the Control arm. The primary reason for patient exclusion from the primary efficacy population was that an evaluable baseline or post-baseline CT scan was not available or acceptable to the central radiology reviewers. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation in each arm was disease progression (BTH1677, 45.9%; Control, 41.9%).</p><p>Patient demographics and disease characteristics at baseline are shown in Table <xref>1</xref>. The BTH1677 and Control arms were similar with respect to age, sex, race, as well as time from initial tumor diagnosis to diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to randomization. The percentage of patients with ECOG PS status of 1 vs 0 was higher in the BTH1677 arm (47.5%) than in the Control arm (33.3%). The percentage of patients who received prior cancer treatments (radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal, or other) was also higher in the BTH1677 arm compared with the Control arm.<table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient demographics and disease characteristics at baseline (Safety population)</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>BTH1677/<break></break>Bevacizumab/Carboplatin/<break></break>Paclitaxel<break></break> (<italic>N</italic> = 59)</th><th>Bevacizumab/<break></break>Carboplatin/<break></break>Paclitaxel<break></break> (<italic> N</italic> = 30)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age (years)</td></tr><tr><td> Median (range)<sup>a</sup></td><td>59 (43, 76)</td><td>58 (28, 75)</td></tr><tr><td>Sex, n (%)</td></tr><tr><td> Male</td><td>26 (44.1)</td><td>14 (46.7)</td></tr><tr><td> Female</td><td>33 (55.9)</td><td>16 (53.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Race, n (%)</td></tr><tr><td> White</td><td>57 (96.6)</td><td>30 (100.0)</td></tr><tr><td> Black</td><td>1 (1.7)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td> Asian or Pacific Islander</td><td>1 (1.7)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>ECOG Performance Status, n (%)</td></tr><tr><td> 0</td><td>31 (52.5)</td><td>20 (66.7)</td></tr><tr><td> 1</td><td>28 (47.5)</td><td>10 (33.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Disease stage at randomization</td></tr><tr><td> Stage IIIB</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td> Stage IV</td><td>59 (100.0)</td><td>30 (100.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Time from initial tumor diagnosis to diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC (days)<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td> Median (range)</td><td>0 (0, 3158)</td><td>0 (0, 0)</td></tr><tr><td>Time from diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to randomization (days)<sup>c</sup></td></tr><tr><td> Median (range)</td><td>18 (1, 168)</td><td>17.5 (7, 77)</td></tr><tr><td>Time from initial tumor diagnosis to randomization (days)<sup>d</sup></td></tr><tr><td> Median (range)</td><td>20 (1, 3171)</td><td>17.5 (7, 77)</td></tr><tr><td>Prior cancer treatment, n (%)</td></tr><tr><td> Radiotherapy</td><td>2 (3.4)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td> Surgery</td><td>8 (13.6)</td><td>2 (6.7)</td></tr><tr><td> Chemotherapy, hormonal, or other<sup>e</sup></td><td>2 (3.4)</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>Abbreviations: ECOG</italic> Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, <italic> N</italic> overall sample size, <italic>n</italic> number of patients, <italic>NSCLC</italic> non-small cell lung cancer</p><p><sup>a</sup>Inclusion criteria restricted patients to 18 to 75 years of age but one 76-year-old patient was inadvertently enrolled in the study</p><p><sup>b</sup>Time from initial tumor diagnosis to diagnosis of Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC = Stage IIIB/IV diagnosis date - initial tumor diagnosis date</p><p><sup>c</sup>Time from diagnosis of Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to randomization = Date of randomization - Stage IIIB/IV diagnosis date</p><p><sup>d</sup>Time from initial tumor diagnosis to randomization = Date of randomization –initial tumor diagnosis date</p><p><sup>e</sup>Two patients in the BTH1677 arm received prior chemotherapy for lung cancer.

For purposes of comparison here, Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs that occurred in ≥5% of patients in either treatment arm included neutropenia (39.0% BTH1677 vs 26.7% Control), thrombocytopenia (18.6% BTH1677 vs 16.7% Control), leukopenia (5.1% BTH1677 vs 3.3% Control), nausea (8.5% BTH1677 vs 0% Control), hemoglobin decreased (1.7% BTH1677 vs 6.7% Control), polyneuropathy (5.1% BTH1677 vs 0% Control), dyspnea (5.1% BTH1677 vs 0% Control), and hypertension (5.1% BTH1677 vs 3.3% Control).</p><p>Eight deaths (7 in the BTH1677 arm; 1 in the Control arm) were reported in the treatment phase of within 30 days of the last dose of study medication. Six of the 7 deaths in the BTH1677 arm were due to disease progression or complications of disease progression (e.g., pneumonia due to lung cancer, pneumothorax); the other death was due to intracranial hemorrhage that occurred subsequent to administration of anticoagulant for a blood clot in the lung. The 1 death in the Control arm was due to complications of disease progression (pneumonia due to lung cancer).</p></sec><sec><title>BTH1677 pharmacokinetics</title><p>BTH1677 serum concentrations in both cycles were above the limit of quantitation (4.7 ng/mL) for all but 1 patient. Individual t<sub>max</sub> values generally coincided with the end of infusion or shortly thereafter. Mean serum trough levels of BTH1677 appeared to plateau as of Day 15 of Cycle 1, suggesting that steady state was achieved as of Day 15. Table <xref>6</xref> summarizes the PK parameters of BTH1677 from Cycle 1/Day 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 53) and Cycle 3/Day 1 (<italic> n</italic> = 42). Geometric mean C<sub>max</sub> of serum BTH1677 was similar in Cycle 1 (49.77 μg/mL) and Cycle 3 (60.50 μg/mL). AUC<sub>0-24</sub> of BTH1677 was also similar in Cycle 1 (399.8 μg•hr./mL) and Cycle 3 (464.4 μg•hr./mL), with little to no accumulation of BTH1677 being observed. No notable difference in other PK parameters (CL, t<sub> max</sub>, and V<sub>ss</sub>) between Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 were observed. A longer elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was observed in Cycle 1 (17.56 h) than Cycle 3 (7.17 h); however, these results should be interpreted with caution given the difference in sampling periods between Cycle 1 (up to 168 h post dosing) and Cycle 3 (only up to 24 h post dosing).<table-wrap><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Summary of BTH1677 pharmacokinetics parameters</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Parameters</th><th>Geometric Mean (CV%)</th></tr><tr><th>BTH1677/Bevacizumab/<break></break> Carboplatin/Paclitaxel</th></tr><tr><th>Cycle 1/Day 1</th><th>Cycle 3/Day 1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>N</td><td>53<sup>b</sup></td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>AUC<sub>0–last</sub> (μg•hr./mL)</td><td>614.6 (52.0)</td><td>423.5 (48.1)</td></tr><tr><td>AUC<sub>0–24</sub> (μg•hr./mL)</td><td>399.8 (37.3)</td><td>464.4 (38.9)<sup>d</sup></td></tr><tr><td>AUC<sub>0–∞</sub> (μg•hr./mL)</td><td>635.9 (49.5)<sup>c</sup></td><td>518.6 (42.2)<sup>e</sup></td></tr><tr><td>C<sub>max</sub> (μg/mL)</td><td>49.77 (36.1)</td><td>60.50 (49.2)</td></tr><tr><td>CL (L/h)</td><td>0.441 (47.3)<sup>c</sup></td><td>0.548 (41.6)<sup>e</sup></td></tr><tr><td>t<sub>1/2</sub> (hr)</td><td>17.56 (36.9)<sup>c</sup></td><td>7.17 (35.3)<sup>e</sup></td></tr><tr><td>t<sub>max</sub> (hr)<sup>a</sup></td><td>2.48 (1.52, 5.90)</td><td>2.37 (1.92, 6.88)</td></tr><tr><td>V<sub>ss</sub> (L)</td><td>5.37 (42.4)<sup>c</sup></td><td>4.13 (51.5)<sup>e</sup></td></tr><tr><td>R (AUC)</td><td>NA</td><td>1.10 (27.3)<sup>d</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>Abbreviations: AUC</italic><sub><italic>(0-last)</italic></sub> area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration, <italic>AUC</italic><sub><italic>0–24</italic></sub> area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 h, <italic> AUC</italic><sub><italic>0–∞</italic></sub> area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> maximum serum concentration, <italic>CL</italic> systemic clearance, <italic>CV</italic> coefficient of variation, <italic>hr.</italic> hour, <italic>L</italic> liter, <italic> mL</italic> milliliter, <italic>N</italic> overall sample size, <italic> NA</italic> not applicable, <italic>R (AUC)</italic> accumulation ratio calculated as AUC<sub> 0-24</sub> (Cycle 3)/AUC<sub>0-24</sub> (Cycle 1), <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub> elimination half-life, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> time of maximum concentration, μg microgram, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>ss</italic></sub> volume of distribution at steady-state</p><p><sup>a</sup>Median (range)</p><p><sup>b</sup>Although 2 other patients met the basic criteria for inclusion in the PK population (ie, having at least 75% of the PK measurements available for any particular treatment cycle data set), 2 patients were subsequently excluded from analysis.
