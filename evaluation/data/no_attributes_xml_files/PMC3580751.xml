<abstract><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The preventive impact of hospital-acquired infection (HAI) surveillance is difficult to assess. Our objective was to investigate the effect of HAI surveillance disruption on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A quasi-experimental study with an intervention group and a control group was conducted between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2010 in two intensive care units (ICUs) of a university hospital that participated in a national HAI surveillance network. Surveillance was interrupted during the year 2007 in unit A (intervention group) and was continuous in unit B (control group). Period 1 (pre-test period) comprised patients hospitalized during 2004 to 2006, and period 2 (post-test period) involved patients hospitalized during 2008 to 2010. Patients hospitalized ≥48 hours and intubated during their stay were included. Multivariate Poisson regression was fitted to ascertain the influence of surveillance disruption.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2,771 patients, accounting for 19,848 intubation-days at risk, were studied; 307 had VAP. The VAP attack rate increased in unit A from 7.8% during period 1 to 17.1% during period 2 (<italic>P </italic>&lt;0.001); in unit B, it was 7.2% and 11.2% for the two periods respectively (<italic>P </italic>= 0.17). Adjusted VAP incidence rose in unit A after surveillance disruption (incidence rate ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.47, <italic>P </italic>= 0.036), independently of VAP trend; no change was observed in unit B. All-cause mortality and length of stay increased (<italic>P </italic>= 0.028 and <italic>P </italic>= 0.038, respectively) in unit A between periods 1 and 2. In unit B, no change in mortality was observed (<italic>P </italic>= 0.22), while length of stay decreased between periods 1 and 2 (<italic>P </italic>= 0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>VAP incidence, length of stay and all-cause mortality rose after HAI surveillance disruption in ICU, which suggests a specific effect of HAI surveillance on VAP prevention and reinforces the role of data feedback and counselling as a mechanism to facilitate performance improvement.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Of the 4,411 patients included in the surveillance of both units during the study period, 2,915 (61.1%) were exposed to mechanical ventilation during their hospital stay. Data were missing for 4.9% (n = 144) of intubated patients and were, therefore, excluded.</p><p>Totally, 2,771 patients, accounting for 37,330 hospitalisation days, 26,768 intubation-days and 19,848 intubation-days at risk, were analysed. Among them, 940 (34%) were hospitalised in unit A, and 1,831 (66%) in unit B. Overall, 62% (n = 1,724) were men, and mean ± SD age was 60 ± 16 years. Totally, 61% (n = 1,694) received antibiotics at admission, 41% (n = 1,142) came from home, and 26% (n = 721) were immunosuppressed. Mean ± SD SAPSII score was 53 ± 20. All-cause in-hospital mortality was 26% (n = 712).</p><p>Overall, 307 patients had VAP. The VAP attack rate was 11.1 per 100 intubated patients and the VAP incidence rate was 15.5 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 13.8 to 17.3) per 1,000 intubation-days at risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics by group and period</title><p>Table <xref>1</xref> reports the characteristics of hospitalised patients by group and period. In the intervention group with surveillance interrupted in 2007, patients hospitalised during period 2 compared to period 1 more often came from home (<italic>P </italic>= 0.004), were more immunosuppressed (<italic>P </italic>&lt;0.001), more often had surgery as diagnosis category (<italic>P </italic>&lt;0.001), received antibiotics less frequently at admission (<italic>P </italic>&lt;.001), were older (<italic>P </italic>= 0.022), and presented lower mean SAPSII (<italic>P </italic>&lt;0.001). In the control group with continuous surveillance, patients hospitalised during period 2 compared to period 1 were less likely to come from home (<italic>P </italic>&lt;0.001), were more immunosuppressed (<italic>P </italic>&lt;0.001), and received antibiotics more frequently at admission (<italic>P </italic>&lt;0.001).</p><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Description of the study population by period and ICU, Edouard Herriot Hospital, Lyon (France), 2004-2010.</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Characteristics</th><th>Intervention group: <break></break>Interrupted surveillance, unit A</th><th>Control group: <break></break>Continuous surveillance, unit B</th></tr><tr><th></th><th><hr/></th></tr><tr><th></th><th>Period 1 2004 to 2006 (n = 448)</th><th>Period 2 2007 to 2010 (n = 492)</th><th><italic>P</italic></th><th>Period 1 2004 to 2006 (n = 743)</th><th>Period 2 2007 to 2010 (n = 881)</th><th><italic>P</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Categorical variable, <break></break>n (%)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Gender, male</td><td>308 (68.8)</td><td>320 (65.0)</td><td>0.23</td><td>439 (59.1)</td><td>531 (60.3)</td><td>0.63</td></tr><tr><td> Patient origin</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.004</td><td></td><td></td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td> Home</td><td>70 (15.6)</td><td>114 (23.2)</td><td></td><td>421 (56.7)</td><td>421 (47.8)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Other unit/hospital</td><td>378 (84.4)</td><td>378 (76.8)</td><td></td><td>322 (43.3)</td><td>460 (52.2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Immunosuppressed<sup>a</sup></td><td>153 (34)</td><td>263 (53)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>98 (13.2)</td><td>175 (19.9)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td> Diagnosis category<sup>a</sup></td><td></td><td></td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.060</td></tr><tr><td> Medical</td><td>265 (59.2)</td><td>161 (32.7)</td><td></td><td>660 (88.8)</td><td>807 (91.6)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Surgery</td><td>183 (40.9)</td><td>331 (67.3)</td><td></td><td>83 (11.2)</td><td>74 (8.4)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Antibiotics<sup>a</sup></td><td>284 (63.4)</td><td>230 (46.8)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>397 (53.4)</td><td>629 (71.4)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td> Deceased in-hospital</td><td>60 (13.5)</td><td>91 (18.8)</td><td>0.028</td><td>236 (31.9)</td><td>256 (29.1)</td><td>0.22</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Continuous variable, <break></break>mean (SD)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Age, years<sup>a</sup></td><td>56.3 (14.9)</td><td>58.5 (15.5)</td><td>0.022</td><td>61.1 (16.4)</td><td>60.7 (59.6)</td><td>0.61</td></tr><tr><td> SAPSII<sup>a</sup></td><td>51.7 (17.9)</td><td>45.4 (21.0)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>55.6 (19.8)</td><td>55.5 (18.8)</td><td>0.95</td></tr><tr><td> Length of hospital stay, days</td><td>12.2 (18.6)</td><td>15.3 (25.7)</td><td>0.038</td><td>14.8 (20.3)</td><td>12.0 (17.0)</td><td>0.0023</td></tr><tr><td> Length of invasive mechanical ventilation, days</td><td>7.7 (14.5)</td><td>11.3 (24.7)</td><td>0.007</td><td>11.1 (19.0)</td><td>8.5 (14.5)</td><td>0.0015</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Incidence of VAP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Number of VAP</td><td>35</td><td>84</td><td></td><td>68</td><td>99</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Attack rate<sup>b</sup></td><td>7.8</td><td>17.1</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>9.2</td><td>11.2</td><td>0.17</td></tr><tr><td> Incidence<sup>c </sup>(95% CI)</td><td>13.4 <break></break>(9.5-18.4)</td><td>22.9 <break></break>(18.4-28.2)</td><td></td><td>11.2 <break></break>(8.7-14.1)</td><td>17.1 <break></break>(14.0-20.8)</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>NOTE: CI, confidence interval; SD, standard deviation; SAPSII, simplified acute physiological score II; VAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia. <sup>a </sup>At ICU admission. <sup>b </sup>Number of VAP per 100 intubated patients. <sup>c </sup>Number of VAP per 1,000 intubation-days.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Duration of exposure by group and period</title><p>In the intervention group with surveillance interrupted in 2007, mean length of ICU stay and of invasive mechanical ventilation was longer during period 2 compared to period 1 (<italic>P </italic>= 0.038 and <italic>P </italic>= 0.007, respectively).
