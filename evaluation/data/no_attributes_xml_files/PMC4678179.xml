Gemcitabine undergoes intracellular conversion, from 2′,2′-difluoro 2′-deoxycytidine (dFdC) to the active triphosphate form 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP), responsible for inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. To directly measure drug delivery, dFdCTP levels were analyzed in PC tumors of KPP mice after continuous 10-day HhAntag treatment and a single dose of gemcitabine. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that dFdCTP concentrations were similar in both vehicle- and HhAntag-treated KPP mice (<xref>Fig 4</xref>C; Mann-Whitney <italic>P</italic> = 1.00). Intracellular gemcitabine is also converted to an inactivated form, diflurodeoxyuridine (dFdU). The ratio of the unprocessed form (dFdC) to inactive form (dFdU) estimates intratumoral gemcitabine exposure. The average ratio of dFdC to dFdU in KPP tumors of HhAntag-treated mice was not significantly different between vehicle and SMO inhibitor groups (<xref>Fig 4</xref>D; <italic>P</italic> = .48). Together, these results indicated that HhAntag did not increase gemcitabine delivery in this genetically engineered PC mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Pancreatic tumor progression and OS remain unaltered by Hh pathway inhibition.</title><p>Next, we investigated the therapeutic impact of HhAntag in KPP mice.
