<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Extending contact with participants after initial, intensive intervention may support maintenance of weight loss and related behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>This community-wide trial evaluated a text message (short message service, SMS)-delivered, extended contact intervention (‘Get Healthy, Stay Healthy’ (GHSH)), which followed on from a population-level, behavioral telephone coaching program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study employed a parallel, randomized controlled trial: GHSH compared with no continued contact (standard practice). Participants (n=228) were recruited after completing a 6-month lifestyle telephone coaching program: mean age = 53.4 (standard deviation (SD)=12.3) years; 66.7% (152/228) female; mean body mass index (BMI) upon entering GHSH=29.5 kg/m2 (SD = 6.0). Participants received tailored text messages over a 6-month period. The message frequency, timing, and content of the messages was based on participant preference, ascertained during two tailoring telephone calls. Primary outcomes of body weight, waist circumference, physical activity (walking, moderate, and vigorous sessions/week), and dietary behaviors (fruit and vegetable serves/day, cups of sweetened drinks per day, takeaway meals per week; fat, fiber and total indices from the Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire) were assessed via self-report before (baseline) and after (6-months) extended contact (with moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) also assessed via accelerometry).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Significant intervention effects, all favoring the intervention group, were observed at 6-months for change in weight (-1.35 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.24, -0.46, <italic>P</italic>=.003), weekly moderate physical activity sessions (0.56 sessions/week, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.96, <italic>P</italic>=.008) and accelerometer-assessed MVPA (24.16 minutes/week, 95% CI: 5.07, 43.25, <italic>P</italic>=.007). Waist circumference, other physical activity outcomes and dietary outcomes, did not differ significantly between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The GHSH extended care intervention led to significantly better anthropometric and physical activity outcomes than standard practice (no contact). This evidence is useful for scaling up the delivery of GHSH as standard practice following the population-level telephone coaching program.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>There were 1071 clients invited to participate in this study, of whom 300 expressed verbal interest in participating in the trial, and 228 participants consented and were randomized (228/300, 76%; <xref>Figure 1</xref>). <xref>Table 1</xref> shows the demographic characteristics of GHSH participants (intervention, n=114; control, n=114). Upon entering the GHSH trial, participants (152/228, 67% female) had a mean age of 53.4 (standard deviation (SD) = 12.3) years and BMI of 29.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>(SD = 6.0), 34% (78/228) were overweight and 38% (87/228) were obese, 40% (91/228) did not meet physical activity guidelines [<xref>28</xref>] (ie, &lt;150 minutes MVPA per week), and 80% (182/228) did not consume the recommended serves of fruit (ie, two) and/or vegetables (ie, five) per day [<xref>29</xref>].The GHSH sample was not representative of all participants completing the final GHS coaching call. Odds of being in the GHSH trial were significantly higher than their respective counterparts for those: aged &lt;60 years; not working; without a post school qualification; self-reported diagnosis of hypertension; self-reported diagnosis of high cholesterol; doing no vigorous activity; and, who consume &lt;1 takeaway meal per week (<xref>Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>).</p><p>The overall retention rate from baseline to 6 months was 95% (216/228) (103/114, 90% in intervention and 113/114, 99% in controls, <italic>P</italic>=.005).

The control group changed significantly in moderate activity and MVPA, which both declined (−0.68, 95% CI: −1.11, -0.26 sessions/week, and −16.10, 95% CI −28.60, −3.61 min/week; <xref>Table 2</xref>). The intervention group did significantly better than the control group in moderate activity (0.56, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.96 sessions/week) and in accelerometer-assessed MVPA (24.16, 95% CI: 5.07, 43.25 min/week; <xref>Table 3</xref>). Intervention effects for walking and vigorous activity were not significant (<xref>Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dietary Behaviors</title><p>In the intervention group, small, but statistically significant improvements in dietary outcomes were observed for the FFBQ Fiber and Total Indices, while remaining dietary outcomes, except takeaway meals per week, were all maintained (<xref>Table 2</xref>). By contrast, in the control group, there were no statistically significant improvements, only statistically significant declines in vegetable intake and fruit intake (<xref>Table 2</xref>). Other dietary outcomes were maintained. No significant or meaningful intervention effect for dietary outcomes was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity Analyses</title><p>Results from analyses using multiple imputation mostly supported the interpretations from the main analyses (<xref>Multimedia Appendix 4</xref>), except that due to slightly narrower CIs in the multiple imputation analysis, the intervention group maintained takeaway meals/week (rather than being ‘inconclusive’) and the intervention effect for vegetable serves/day was ‘similar’ (rather than ‘inconclusive’). Conclusions using the alternative models mostly supported the main findings (<xref>Multimedia Appendix 5</xref>) and revealed significant differences in walking ( <italic>P</italic>=.018). The intervention group showed a greater tendency to walk than controls (odds ratio = 2.17, 95% CI: 0.45, 10.43, <italic>P</italic>=.334), but also to report fewer walking sessions when they did walk than controls (relative rate = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.92, <italic>P</italic>=.005).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Feasibility Results</title><p>The mean (±SD) call duration was 34 ±8 minutes for the initial tailoring call and 18 ±8 minutes for the 12-week tailoring call. The median number of text messages requested during the initial tailoring call and at the 12-week tailoring call were both five per fortnight (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup>percentiles =3-7 texts). During the initial tailoring call, 40% (46/111) of participants requested fortnightly goal checks for both behavioral goals; 35% (40/111) weekly for both goals; and, 22%(25/111) weekly for one goal and fortnightly for the other goal. Approximately one-half the participants (58/111, 52%) did not request any real-time behavioral prompts and 35% (39/111) requested between 2-4 prompts per fortnight. Almost all (89/95, 94%) intervention participants still enrolled at 12-weeks completed the 12-week tailoring interview. During the 12-week tailoring call, almost all (82/89, 92%) participants changed their preference for text message content, and 40% (36/89) changed their preferred text message schedule. Outside of the 12-week tailoring call, only 3% (3/90) of participants changed either of these preferences via text. The weight goal reset text received replies from 30% (33/111) of participants at week 6 and 26% (25/95) at week 18. At week 6, 40% (44/111) of participants reset at least one behavioral goal; 29% (28/95) did so in week 18. Intervention completers (n=90) replied to 84% of goal check texts sent in week 1 (152/180) and 69% (125/180) of goal check texts sent in the last week.</p></sec><sec><title>Acceptability Results</title><p>Most (69/99, 70%) participants rated GHSH as “useful” or “extremely useful” in supporting their weight goal, and 75% (74/99) reported that they were “satisfied” or “extremely satisfied” with the intervention. Follow-up interviews with 62 intervention participants revealed that: experience with text messaging prior to GHSH impacted on participants’ experience during the intervention; the GHSH program often exceeded participants’ expectations; and participants generally perceived the GHS and GHSH intervention to be one program. Reasons for liking GHSH focused on: the reminders provided by the text messages to reinforce what participants wanted to do; maintaining accountability; and increased awareness of behaviors in real time. The few participants who did not like aspects of the GHSH nominated text messages being too repetitive or automated as key reasons.</p></sec><sec><title>Costs of Intervention Delivery Results</title><p>Health coach staff spent, on average, 35 minutes per participant conducting and preparing for the initial tailoring interview and 30 minutes for the 12-week tailoring interview. Research staff spent on average 31 minutes per participant entering tailoring data into the software following the initial tailoring call and 15 minutes per participant after the 12-week tailoring call. Research staff had to manually trigger responses to 813 goal check replies not recognized by the software (813/2071, 39%) of responses received), which took approximately 1 minute per response. During the intervention, 8518 text messages were sent to participants (at AU$0.15 each) totaling AU$1278 (averaging AU$11.21 per participant). Overall, it cost approximately AU$80.00 per participant to deliver the GHSH extended contact intervention.</p></sec><sec><title></title><table-wrap><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Mean changes
