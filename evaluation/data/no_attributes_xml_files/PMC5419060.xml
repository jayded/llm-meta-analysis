<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>There is an increasing amount of blood sample rejection at primary health care facilities (PHCFs), impacting negatively the staff, facility, patient and laboratory costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>The primary objective was to determine the rejection rate and reasons for blood sample rejection at four PHCFs before and after a phlebotomy training programme. The secondary objective was to determine whether phlebotomy training improved knowledge among primary health care providers (HCPs) and to develop a tool for blood sample acceptability.</p></sec><sec><title>Study setting</title><p>Two community health centres (CHCs) and two community day centres (CDCs) in Cape Town.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A quasi-experimental study design (before and after a phlebotomy training programme).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The sample rejection rate was 0.79% (<italic>n</italic> = 60) at CHC A, 1.13% (<italic>n</italic> = 45) at CHC B, 1.64% (<italic>n</italic> = 38) at CDC C and 1.36% (<italic>n</italic> = 8) at CDC D pre-training.

There were 23 study participants (<xref>Table 1</xref>) who attended the phlebotomy training session across all the facilities. The age, sex and level of phlebotomy experience of each HCP who attended the training were recorded. There were no exclusion criteria for the above variables of age, sex and level of experience. Most of the HCPs were aged between 30 and 50 years. There was only 1 male participant and 22 females. There were 3 student nurses, 17 nurses and only 3 doctors. The phlebotomy experience across participants varied, with nine participants having less than 5 years’ experience, five having 5–10 years’ experience and nine having more than 30 years’ experience.</p><table-wrap><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data of study participants across all four clinics.</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Participants <italic>n</italic> (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rank</td></tr><tr><td> Student nurse</td><td>3 (13)</td></tr><tr><td> Nurse</td><td>17 (74)</td></tr><tr><td> Doctor</td><td>3 (13)</td></tr><tr><td>Sex</td></tr><tr><td> Male</td><td>1 (5)</td></tr><tr><td> Female</td><td>22 (95)</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td></tr><tr><td> &lt; 30 years</td><td>7 (30)</td></tr><tr><td> 30–50 years</td><td>9 (39)</td></tr><tr><td> &gt; 50 years</td><td>5 (22)</td></tr><tr><td> Unknown</td><td>2 (9)</td></tr><tr><td>Phlebotomy experience</td></tr><tr><td> &lt; 5 years</td><td>9 (39)</td></tr><tr><td> 5–10 years</td><td>5 (22)</td></tr><tr><td> &gt; 10 years</td><td>9 (39)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p><xref>Box 1</xref> describes the tool that was developed to facilitate the phlebotomy training, listing all the criteria for laboratory blood sample acceptability. </p><boxed-text><label>Box 1</label><caption><p>ABBAS tool<sup>©</sup>.</p></caption><list><list-item><p><bold>REQUEST FORM</bold><list><list-item><p>Name of facility</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnosis</p></list-item><list-item><p>Name of requesting doctor</p></list-item><list-item><p>Date and time of sample collection</p></list-item><list-item><p>HCP who took sample</p></list-item><list-item><p>Test specified on request form</p></list-item><list-item><p>Legible request</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient’s details (first name &amp; surname, folder no, age/DOB, sex)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Correct sample type for test requested</p></list-item><list-item><p>Doctor’s signature</p></list-item><list-item><p>INR sample – working contact number of patient or doctor</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>SAMPLE</bold><list><list-item><p>Tube not expired (check expiry date on tube)/cracked</p></list-item><list-item><p>Correct colour tube</p></list-item><list-item><p>Labelled sample (sticker placed lengthwise, NOT covering cap):</p><p>First name and surname, folder number OR sticker if available</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do not pre-label before drawing blood</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient’s name on form and sample matching</p></list-item><list-item><p>Correct volume of blood (check volume required on tube)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gentle mixing of sample 8–10 times</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sample tubes kept at room temperature, NO direct sunlight</p></list-item><list-item><p>Samples kept at room temperature, IN FRIDGE if after hours</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>SAMPLE TRANSPORT</bold><list><list-item><p>Sealed packet</p></list-item><list-item><p>Blood sample/s and request form of index patient in one packet</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list><p>ABBAS tool<sup>©</sup> compiled by: Drs Abbas, Namane and Mukinda.</p></boxed-text><p>The total number of blood samples included in the study during May 2014 (pre-training): 7557 from CHC A, 3973 from CHC B, 2321 from CDC C and 589 from CDC D.

Technique-related errors include samples that were clotted or haemolysed. Knowledge related errors include errors because of incorrect blood volume or the incorrect blood sample tube used. Request form errors include any error in the completion of the request form such as no patient details indicated, illegible requests, name on sample tube and request form unmatched, no test requested or an unlabelled sample. Unaccountable preanalytical errors include all errors that are not accounted for by the above but that occur in the preanalytical phase of laboratory testing of blood samples. These include samples with missing reasons for rejection, samples older than 3 days, samples that leaked in transit as well as samples that were not received by the laboratory.</p><p><xref>Table 3</xref> shows a detailed summary of rejection rates and related reasons by facility. At CHC A, many samples were rejected because of clotting, 20 (0.26%) were rejected pre-training and 16 (0.16%) post-training (<xref>Table 3</xref>). Request form errors improved post-training from 11 (0.15%) pre-training to 8 (0.08%) post-training.
