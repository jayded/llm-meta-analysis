<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Negative attentional biases are thought to increase the risk of recurrence in  depression, suggesting that reduction of such biases may be a plausible  strategy in the secondary prevention of the illness. However, no previous  study has tested whether reducing negative attentional bias causally affects  risk factors for depressive recurrence. The current experimental medicine  study reports the effects of a computerized attentional bias modification  (ABM) procedure on intermediate measures of the risk of depressive  recurrence (residual depressive symptoms and the cortisol awakening  response) in patients with recurrent depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty-one patients with at least two previous episodes of depression who were  currently in remission were randomized to receive either an active  (positive) or placebo computer-based ABM regime. The ABM regime presented  either pictures of faces or words. Residual depressive symptoms, measured  using the Beck Depression Inventory and the cortisol awakening response were  measured immediately before and after completion of the bias modification  and then again after 4 weeks' follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Positive, face-based ABM reduced both measures of recurrence risk (Beck  Depression Inventory and cortisol awakening response). This effect occurred  during the month following completion of bias modification. Word-based  modification did not influence the outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Positive face-based ABM was able to reduce intermediate measures of  recurrence risk in previously depressed patients. These results suggest that  ABM may provide a “cognitive vaccine” against depression and  offer a useful strategy in the secondary prevention of the illness.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Group Demographics, Baseline Measures, and Compliance</title><p>As can be seen from <xref>Table 1</xref>, the groups were  well matched on baseline demographics, IQ, and measures of illness severity. Patients  had been depressed on an average of three previous occasions. Compliance was generally  high with only eight patients completing fewer than 25 sessions of ABM and no difference  in compliance between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>The Effect of ABM on Residual Symptoms</title><p>Positive, relative to placebo, ABM influenced the residual depressive symptoms reported  by patients using the BDI, but this effect depended on whether the ABM used faces or  words [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; <italic>F</italic>(2,112) = 3.7, <italic>  p</italic> = .03]. There was no general ABM type × time effect [<italic>F</italic>(2,112)  = 1.1, <italic>p</italic> = .35]. As can be seen from <xref>Figure  2</xref> positive, face-based ABM lead to a reduction of symptoms compared with placebo  ABM [<xref>Figure 2</xref>A; <italic>F</italic>(2,56) = 3.7, <italic>p</italic>  = .03], whereas word based ABM had no significant effect [<xref>Figure 2</xref>B; <italic>F</italic>(2,56) &lt; 1, <italic>  p</italic> = .4]. Interestingly, the beneficial effect of positive face ABM  displayed a time lag; symptoms did not change across the 2 weeks of ABM [<italic>  F</italic>(1,28) &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .5]; rather, they reduced during  the follow-up period [<italic>F</italic>(1,28) = 5.9, <italic>p</italic> = .02] with  this change resulting from a significant drop in symptoms reported by the positive face  ABM group [<italic>t</italic>(15) = 2.4, <italic>p</italic> = .03] and no significant  change seen in the placebo face ABM group [<italic>t</italic>(13) &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic>  = .4].</p><p>Observer reported depressive symptoms, measured using the HRSD, revealed an identical ABM  type × ABM stimuli × time interaction [<xref>Figure 2</xref>C and <xref>2</xref>D; <italic>F</italic>(2,112) = 3.4, <italic>p</italic> =  .04]; however, in this case, the post hoc tests of the interaction for face training was  significant only at a trend level [<italic>F</italic>(1,28) = 2.9, <italic>  p</italic> = .09].</p><p>Symptoms of anxiety, measured using the trait subscale of the STAI displayed the same  specific effect of positive face ABM as that seen for the BDI [<xref>Figures 2</xref>E, F; <italic>F</italic>(2,112) = 3.3, <italic>  p</italic> = .05] with the beneficial effect again occurring during follow-up [<italic>  F</italic>(1,28) = 5.2, <italic>p</italic> = .03] and being driven by a significant  reduction of anxious symptoms in the positive face ABM group [<italic>t</italic>(15) =  2.4, <italic>p</italic> = .03].</p></sec><sec><title>The Effect of ABM on the CAR</title><p>Analysis of the CAR response revealed a significant ABM type × ABM stimuli  interaction [<italic>F</italic>(1,53) = 4.3, <italic>p</italic> = .04], which was  present across the three time points [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; <italic>  F</italic>(2,106)&lt;1, <italic>p</italic> = .4]. In keeping with the effects on  residual symptoms, face-based ABM influenced the CAR [<xref>Figure 3</xref>A; <italic>F</italic>(2,54) = 4, <italic>p</italic> =  .02], whereas word-based ABM did not [<xref>Figure 3</xref>B; <italic>F</italic>(2,52) &lt; 1, <italic>  p</italic> = .8]. Specifically, positive relative to placebo face ABM caused a  reduction of the CAR across the follow-up period [<italic>F</italic>(1,27) = 5, <italic>  p</italic> = .03] with no change being seen during ABM [<italic>F</italic>(1,27)  &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .9]. This relative reduction was produced by a  nonsignificant decrease in the positive ABM group during follow-up [<italic>t</italic>(14)  = 1.7, <italic>p</italic> = .1] and a nonsignificant increase in the placebo group [<italic>  t</italic>(13) = 1.5, <italic>p</italic> = .2].</p></sec><sec><title>The Effect of ABM on Attentional Function</title><p>Positive relative to placebo bias modification produced a differential effect on  attentional bias (<xref>Figure 4</xref>), as measured by the  word based visual-probe task [ABM type × time; <italic>F</italic>(2,112) = 3.1, <italic>  p</italic> = .05]. However, unlike the previous results, this effect did not  significantly differ between the face- and word-trained groups [ABM type × ABM  stimuli × time; <italic>F</italic>(2,112) &lt; 1, <italic>  p</italic> = .9]. The effect of ABM was seen across the bias modification period [<italic>  F</italic>(1,57) = 8.3, <italic>p</italic> = .006] with no significant change occurring  across follow-up [<italic>F</italic>(1,56) &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .4]. When  considering the within group effects produced, positive-face ABM led to a significant  increase in positive bias across the modification period [<italic>t</italic>(15) = 3.7, <italic>  p</italic> = .002], whereas face placebo ABM did not change the bias [<italic>t</italic>(13)  &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .9]. Interestingly, the effect of word ABM was driven  by a trend level decrease in bias in the placebo word group [<italic>t</italic>(14) =  2.1, <italic>p</italic> = .051] with no effect seen for positive word ABM [<italic>  t</italic>(15)&lt;1, <italic>p</italic> = .5]. The correlation between change  in attentional bias across the bias modification period and reduction in BDI or CAR  across the follow-up period in the positive face-ABM group was not significant [<italic>  r</italic>(16) = .37, not significant, and <italic>r</italic>(15) = .34, not  significant, respectively]. Additional analysis is provide in <xref>Supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Attentional bias, assessed using face stimuli, was insensitive to the effect of the ABM  interventions [<italic>F</italic>(2,112)&lt;1, <italic>p</italic> = 1]. This  remained the case when analysis was restricted to those who had completed face based ABM  [<italic>F</italic>(2,56) &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .7].</p></sec></sec><floats-group><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design and attentional bias modification (ABM) task used. <bold>(A)</bold>  Patients completed three assessment sessions, immediately before and after 2 weeks  of ABM and then again a month later.
