<abstract><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The objective of this study was to assess the impact of certolizumab pegol (CZP) treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), fatigue and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with active RA (N = 982) were randomized 2:2:1 to subcutaneous CZP (400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4; followed by CZP 200 mg or 400 mg) plus methotrexate (MTX) every other week, or placebo (PBO) plus MTX. PRO assessments included HRQoL, fatigue, physical function, arthritis pain and disease activity. Adjusted mean changes from baseline in all PROs were obtained using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) applying last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation. The proportion of patients achieving clinically meaningful improvements in each PRO was obtained using logistic regression and by applying non-responder imputation to missing values after rescue medication or withdrawal. The correlations between PRO responses and clinical responses were also assessed by tetrachoric correlation using non-responder imputation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients treated with CZP plus MTX reported significant (<italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.001), clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL at the first assessment (week 12); reductions in fatigue, disease activity and pain and improvements in physical function were reported at week 1. In particular, CZP-treated patients reported improvements in mental health. Mean changes from baseline in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) at week 52 for CZP 200 mg and 400 mg plus MTX, and PBO plus MTX were 6.4, 6.4 and 2.1, respectively (<italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.001). In addition, mental health and vitality scores in CZP-treated patients approached age- and gender-adjusted US population norms. Improvements in all PROs were sustained. Similar benefits were reported with both CZP doses. Changes in SF-36 MCS scores had the lowest correlation with disease activity scores (DAS28) and American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement (ACR20) response rates, while improvements in pain showed the highest correlation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with CZP plus MTX resulted in rapid and sustained improvements in all PROs, indicating that the benefits of CZP extend beyond clinical efficacy endpoints into areas that are more relevant and meaningful for patients on a daily basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00152386.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 982 patients were randomized in RAPID 1: 393 to CZP 200 mg plus MTX, 390 to CZP 400 mg plus MTX, and 199 to PBO plus MTX. Of these, 255 (64.9%), 274 (70.3%) and 43 (21.6%) completed 52 weeks of treatment, respectively [<xref>28</xref>]. At baseline, 82% of patients were female, with mean age 52 years, 77% rheumatoid factor positive, mean disease duration 6.2 years, and having failed a mean of 1.4 disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; excluding MTX). The burden of RA at baseline was significant, as evidenced by patient-reported global assessment of disease activity, pain, physical function, and fatigue scores (Table <xref>1</xref>). In particular, SF-36 domain scores at baseline were markedly lower than age- and gender-matched US population norms, and SF-36 MCS and PCS scores reflected a significant psychological burden as well as physical impairments.</p><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline disease activity and PRO scores (ITT population)</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Characteristic, mean (SD)</th><th>CZP 200 mg + MTX <break></break>(n = 393)</th><th>CZP 400 mg + MTX <break></break>(n = 390)</th><th>PBO + MTX <break></break>(n = 199)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>DAS28, range 0-10</td><td>6.9 (0.8)</td><td>6.9 (0.8)</td><td>7.0 (0.9)</td></tr><tr><td>PtGA VAS, range 0-100 mm</td><td>63.1 (20.3)</td><td>64.1 (18.3)</td><td>64.2 (19.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Pain VAS, range 0-100 mm</td><td>62.1 (20.0)</td><td>63.8 (17.2)</td><td>63.6 (19.9)</td></tr><tr><td>HAQ-DI, range 0-3</td><td>1.7 (0.6)</td><td>1.7 (0.6)</td><td>1.7 (0.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Fatigue NRS, range 0-10</td><td>6.4 (2.0)</td><td>6.5 (1.9)</td><td>6.7 (2.0)</td></tr><tr><td>SF-36</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> PCS, range 0-100*</td><td>30.9 (6.5)</td><td>30.8 (6.8)</td><td>30.5 (5.8)</td></tr><tr><td> MCS, range 0-100*</td><td>40.0 (11.2)</td><td>39.3 (11.1)</td><td>38.6 (11.4)</td></tr><tr><td> Domains, range 0-100</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Physical Functioning</td><td>33.4 (21.4)</td><td>32.9 (21.2)</td><td>32.0 (20.1)</td></tr><tr><td>  Role Physical</td><td>13.3 (23.7)</td><td>12.9 (25.4)</td><td>11.2 (20.8)</td></tr><tr><td>  Bodily Pain</td><td>30.6 (15.3)</td><td>28.9 (15.9)</td><td>28.5 (14.7)</td></tr><tr><td>  General Health</td><td>35.3 (16.5)</td><td>35.9 (17.5)</td><td>34.9 (15.6)</td></tr><tr><td>  Vitality</td><td>35.8 (18.0)</td><td>36.1 (18.6)</td><td>32.9 (17.4)</td></tr><tr><td>  Social Functioning</td><td>50.9 (23.8)</td><td>48.1 (24.0)</td><td>46.6 (25.2)</td></tr><tr><td>  Role Emotional</td><td>32.4 (39.1)</td><td>28.9 (38.1)</td><td>30.9 (38.7)</td></tr><tr><td>  Mental Health</td><td>53.8 (20.1)</td><td>53.5 (20.7)</td><td>52.2 (21.2)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* mean US population normative value equals 50</p><p>CZP = certolizumab pegol; DAS28 = disease activity score; HAQ-DI = health assessment questionnaire-disability index; ITT = intent to treat; MCS = mental component summary; MTX = methotrexate; NRS = numeric rating scale; PBO = placebo; PCS = physical component summary; PRO = patient-reported outcomes; PtGA = patient's global assessment of disease activity; SD = standard deviation; SF-36 = short-form 36-item health survey; VAS = visual analog scale.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Health-related quality of life and fatigue</title><p>RA patients receiving CZP plus MTX reported statistically significant improvements in HRQoL compared with PBO plus MTX by the first post-baseline assessment (week 12; <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.001); improvements in all eight SF-36 domains (Table <xref>2</xref>), PCS (Figure <xref>1a</xref>), and MCS (Figure <xref>1b</xref>) were sustained to week 52.

In general, PRO responses were in agreement with clinical responses as determined by either improvements in RA signs and symptoms (ACR20 response rates) or decrease in disease activity (DAS28 scores; Table <xref>3</xref>). As expected, classification of response according to physical function and pain was highly correlated with ACR20 response rates, with 88.8% and 93.6% of patients treated with CZP 200 mg plus MTX being classified the same by physical function/ACR20 and pain/ACR20, respectively. Correlations between fatigue and ACR20 responses were also high (90.0%) as were those between patient's global assessment of disease activity (98.0%), while changes in HRQoL (SF-36 PCS and MCS scores) had the lowest correlation with ACR20 responses (84.3% and 77.4%, respectively).</p><table-wrap><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>PRO response by clinical response* at week 52 (CZP 200 mg plus MTX group, ITT population)</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>ACR20 response by (%)</th></tr><tr><th></th><th></th><th><hr/></th></tr><tr><th></th><th></th><th>SF-36 PCS</th><th>SF-36 MCS</th><th>HAQ-DI</th><th>Pain</th><th>FAS</th><th>PtGA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td><bold>Clinical response</bold></td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><bold>PRO response</bold></td><td>No</td><td>45.5</td><td>14.7</td><td>43.4</td><td>19.5</td><td>44.4</td><td>8.7</td><td>44.4</td><td>3.8</td><td>44.1</td><td>7.1</td><td>86.9</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Yes</td><td>1.0</td><td>38.8</td><td>3.1</td><td>33.9</td><td>2.6</td><td>44.4</td><td>1.0</td><td>38.2</td><td>2.8</td><td>45.9</td><td>0</td><td>11.1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tetrachoric correlation (ASE)</td><td>0.9450 (0.0178)</td><td>0.8389 (0.0356)</td><td>0.9504 (0.0152)</td><td>0.9804 (0.0076)</td><td>0.9574 (0.0135)</td><td>0.9996 (0.0053)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><bold>DAS response by (%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><hr/></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><bold>SF-36 PCS</bold></td><td><bold>SF-36 MCS</bold></td><td><bold>HAQ-DI</bold></td><td><bold>Pain</bold></td><td><bold>FAS</bold></td><td><bold>PtGA</bold></td></tr><tr><td><hr/></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><bold>Clinical response</bold></td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><bold>PRO response</bold></td><td>No</td><td>44.2</td><td>16.5</td><td>43.2</td><td>20.4</td><td>43.6</td><td>10.0</td><td>43.6</td><td>5.1</td><td>43.9</td><td>7.7</td><td>44.1</td><td>4.9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Yes</td><td>1.0</td><td>38.2</td><td>2.1</td><td>34.4</td><td>2.1</td><td>44.4</td><td>2.1</td><td>49.2</td><td>1.8</td><td>46.7</td><td>1.5</td><td>49.5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tetrachoric correlation (ASE)</td><td>0.9344 (0.0204)</td><td>0.8674 (0.0322)</td><td>0.9496 (0.0156)</td><td>0.9776 (0.0085)</td><td>0.9672 (0.0114)</td><td>0.9833 (0.0069)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Clinical response = DAS or ACR20 response.</p><p>ACR20 = American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement; ASE = asymptomatic standard error; CZP = certolizumab pegol; DAS = disease activity score; FAS = fatigue assessment scale; HAQ-DI = health assessment questionnaire-disability index; ITT = intent to treat; MCS = mental component summary; MTX = methotrexate; PtGA = patient's global assessment; PCS = physical component summary; PRO = patient-reported outcomes; SF-36 = short-form 36-item health survey</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Results were similar for correlations between PRO responses and DAS28 responses, with SF-36 PCS and MCS scores showing the lowest correlations with DAS28 responses (82.4% and 77.6%, respectively) and physical function, fatigue, pain and global assessment of disease activity showing the highest correlations (88.0%, 90.6%, 92.8% and 93.6%, respectively).</p></sec></sec>
