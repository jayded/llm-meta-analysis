<abstract><p>We evaluated the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents (6–17 years) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week study in Japan. Patients received flexibly dosed aripiprazole (1–15 mg/day) or placebo. Ninety-two patients were randomized to placebo (n = 45) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8. Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8. All patients randomized to aripiprazole completed the study, and no serious adverse events were reported. Three patients in placebo group discontinued. Aripiprazole was effective and generally safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of irritability associated with ASD in Japanese children and adolescents.</p></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subject Disposition and Demographics</title><p>In total, 99 patients were enrolled and 92 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 45) or aripiprazole (n = 47).

At week 8, the least square mean decrease from baseline in the parent/caregiver-rated ABC-J irritability subscale score was significantly greater for patients who received aripiprazole (Table  <xref>2</xref> ; Fig.  <xref>3</xref> ). The TD was −3.94 showing statistical significance (Table  <xref>2</xref> ). Significant TDs in favor of aripiprazole were detected from week 3 through week 8 (Fig.  <xref>3</xref> ). At week 8, aripiprazole group showed a statistically significant improvement in mean clinician-rated CGI-I scores greater than the placebo group [2.7 (0.1) vs 3.4 (0.1); TD: −0.62 (95% CI: −1.02 to − 0.22); p = 0.003]. Significant TDs in favor of aripiprazole were observed from week 2 through week 8 (Fig.  <xref>4</xref> ). Response rates were significantly greater for patients who received aripiprazole from week 3 through week 8 (Table  <xref>2</xref> ; Fig.  <xref>5</xref> ). Patients who received aripiprazole demonstrated significant improvement versus placebo on the mean ABC-J hyperactivity subscale score. Subjects treated with aripiprazole demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in the mean CGI-S score from week 2 through week 8 and the CGAS score at weeks 4 and 8.

One patient in the aripiprazole group experienced salivary hypersecretion, gait disturbance, bradykinesia, lisp and tremor.

Mean serum prolactin concentrations at baseline were 16.7 ng/mL for placebo and 14.3 ng/mL for aripiprazole. Aripiprazole was associated with a significant decrease in serum prolactin concentrations compared with placebo from baseline to week 8 (−13.8 vs −2.0 ng/mL; p &lt; 0.001). No patient in the aripiprazole group experienced increase in serum prolactin concentrations.

No marked abnormalities were observed in the other clinical laboratory tests along with vital sign assessments and the 12-lead ECG, except for the decrease in serum prolactin concentrations in the aripiprazole group as described above.
