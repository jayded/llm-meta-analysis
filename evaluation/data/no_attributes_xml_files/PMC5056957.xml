<abstract><sec><title>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:</title><p>Obesity prevention during adolescence is a health priority. The ‘Physical Activity 4 Everyone' (PA4E1) study tested a multi-component physical activity intervention in 10 secondary schools from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This paper aimed to report the secondary outcomes of the study; to determine whether the intervention impacted on adiposity outcomes (weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI <italic>z</italic>-score), and whether any effect was moderated by sex, baseline BMI and baseline physical activity level, at 12 and 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>SUBJECTS/METHODS:</title><p>A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. The school-based intervention included seven physical activity strategies targeting the following: curriculum (strategies to maximise physical activity in physical education, student physical activity plans, an enhanced school sport programme); school environment (physical activity during school breaks, modification of school policy); and parents and the community (parent engagement, links with community physical activity providers). Students' weight (kg), BMI and BMI <italic>z</italic>-score, were collected at baseline (Grade 7), 12 and 24 months. Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between-group mean difference from baseline to 12 and 24 months. Exploratory sub-analyses were undertaken according to three moderators of energy balance.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 1150 students (mean age=12 years) provided outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91%) at 12 months and 985 (86%) at 24 months. At 12 months, there were group-by-time effects for weight (mean difference=–0.90 kg (95% confidence interval (CI)=–1.50, −0.30), <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m<sup>−2</sup> (−0.50, −0.06), <italic>P</italic>=0.01) in favour of the intervention group, but not for BMI <italic>z</italic>-score (−0.05 (−0.11; 0.01), <italic>P</italic>=0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (−0.62 kg (−1.21, 0.03), <italic>P</italic>=0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m<sup>−2</sup> (−0.49, −0.06), <italic>P</italic>=0.01) at 24 months, with group-by-time effects also found for BMI <italic>z</italic>-score (−0.08 (−0.14; −0.02), <italic>P</italic>=0.02) favouring the intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p>The PA4E1 school-based intervention achieved moderate reductions in adiposity among adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Multi-component interventions that increase adolescents' engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) may assist in preventing unhealthy weight gain.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sample</title><p>Of the 22 eligible schools, 13 were approached to participate in the study. Ten schools consented to participate (77%) and parental consent was obtained for 1233 of the 1468 Grade-7 students in the 10 schools (84%). A total of 1150 students provided adiposity outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91%) at mid-point (12 months) and 985 (86%) at 24 months. Demographic characteristics of the sample at baseline, 12 and 24 months are outlined in <xref>Table 1</xref>. At baseline, the mean age of participants was 12 years, 51% were female, 17% were overweight and 5% were obese, and 64% did not meet the physical activity recommendation of ⩾60 min of MVPA per day. Participants who were lost to follow-up were more likely to be older in age (<italic>P</italic>=0.03) and did not speak English as a primary language (<italic>P</italic>=0.02) compared with those who provided outcome data at all time points.</p><p>At 24 months, all 5 intervention schools had implemented 6 of the 7 physical activity strategies. The exception was strategy 5 (school policy); 4 of the 5 schools had developed a school policy. All intervention implementation strategies were delivered as planned. The majority of intervention group PE teachers (<italic>n</italic>=35) reported using pedometers to increase activity levels in PE (88.9%), and 58.8% reported including student physical activity plans each term. All schools were represented by at least one PE teacher (range 1–5) at each professional learning workshop. More information on intervention delivery can be found in the 24-month physical activity outcome paper.<sup><xref>16</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Indicators of adiposity</title><p>The results for the 12- and 24-month adiposity outcomes are presented in <xref>Table 2</xref>.
