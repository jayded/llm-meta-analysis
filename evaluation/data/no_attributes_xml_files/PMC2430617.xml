<abstract><title>Background</title><p>The safety of the immune complexes composed of yeast-derived hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies (abbreviated as YIC) among healthy adults and chronic hepatitis B patients has been proved in phase I and phase IIa trial. A larger number of patients for study of dosage and efficacy are therefore needed.</p><sec><title>Methods and Principal Findings</title><p>Two hundred forty two HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients were immunized with six injections of either 30 µg YIC, 60 µg of YIC or alum adjuvant as placebo at four-week intervals under code. HBV markers and HBV DNA were monitored during immunization and 24 weeks after the completion of immunization. The primary endpoint was defined as loss of HBeAg, or presence of anti-HBe antibody or suppression of HBV DNA, while the secondary endpoint was both HBeAg seroconversion and suppression of HBV DNA. Statistical significance was not reached in primary endpoints four weeks after the end of treatment among three groups, however, at the end of follow-up, HBeAg sero-conversion rate was 21.8%(17/78) and 9% (7/78) in the 60 µg YIC and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.03), with 95% confidence intervals at 1.5% to 24.1%. Using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) model, a significant difference of group effects was found between 60 µg YIC and the placebo groups in terms of the primary endpoint. Eleven serious adverse events occurred, which were 5.1%, 3.6%, and 5.0% in the placebo, 30 µg YIC and 60 µg YIC groups respectively (p&gt;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Though statistical differences in the preset primary and secondary endpoints among the three groups were not reached, a late and promising HBeAg seroconversion effect was shown in the 60 µg YIC immunized regimen. By increasing the number of patients and injections, the therapeutic efficacy of YIC in chronic hepatitis B patients will be further evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ChiCTR.org <ext-link>ChiCTR-TRC-00000022</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients</title><p>Three hundred and fifty four hepatitis B patients were evaluated for the inclusion criteria. Of these, 242 patients were eligible and assigned randomly to placebo, 30 µg YIC and 60 µg YIC groups in a three-month period. Five patients were found ineligible during the batch assay at the end of treatment (week 24) at the central laboratory, and therefore were excluded from the intent-to-treat analysis. Of 237 patients included in the analysis , 8 receiving placebo, 5 receiving 30ug YIC, and 10 receiving 60ug YIC either did not complete the treatment, did not complete the follow-up or violated the protocol ( <xref>Figure 1</xref> ). No significant difference was found in baseline characteristics among three groups ( <xref>Table 1</xref> ).</p><fig><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0002565.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Summary of participants.</title><p>Footnote: The numbers of SAE patients are those who discontinued treatment, while other SAE patients are not included in this figure.</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><table-wrap><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0002565.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Characteristics of participants.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic></graphic><table><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><td>Characteristics</td><td>Placebo group (N = 78)</td><td>30 µg YIC group (N = 81)</td><td>60 µg YIC group (N = 78)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age (yr; SD)</td><td>27.9±7.6</td><td>28.6±8.6</td><td>28.8±8.0</td></tr><tr><td>Female sex (no. ; %)</td><td>19 (24.4)</td><td>22 (27.2)</td><td>17 (21.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (kg; SD)</td><td>61.7±11.1</td><td>62.3±10.0</td><td>63.7±9.3</td></tr><tr><td>Course of illness, hepatitis B (yr; SD)</td><td>6.3±5.2</td><td>6.0±5.8</td><td>6.1±5.4</td></tr><tr><td>Family history, hepatitis B (no.;%)</td><td>46 (59.0)</td><td>46 (56.8)</td><td>46 (59.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Alanine aminotransferase (IU/liter; SD)</td><td>169.6±80.0</td><td>162.5±74.7</td><td>171.8±93.4</td></tr><tr><td>HBV DNA (log copies/mL; SD)</td><td>7.1±0.9</td><td>7.1±0.9</td><td>7.2±0.8</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn><label></label><p>SD: Standard deviation.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Kinetics of responses in patients</title><p>As shown in <xref>Table 2</xref> , a delayed response to YIC was observed between 24 weeks and the end of follow-up.

Interestingly, rebound of viral load and reversion to serum HBeAg were all from responders who only reached the primary endpoint at the end of immunization, while none occurred in those who reached the secondary endpoint, suggesting that patients who achieved the secondary response at the endpoint of treatment were unlikely to develop reversion.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events and severe adverse events</title><p>Overall, the most common systematic symptoms were similar for the three groups.
