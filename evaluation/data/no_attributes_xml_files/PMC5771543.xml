<abstract><title>Abstract</title><p><bold><italic>Objectives:</italic></bold> To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of desvenlafaxine (25–50 mg/d) compared with placebo in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD).</p><p><bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> Outpatient children (7–11 years) and adolescents (12–17 years) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD and had screening and baseline Children's Depression Rating Scale–Revised (CDRS-R) total scores &gt;40 were randomly assigned to 8-week treatment with placebo, desvenlafaxine (25, 35, or 50 mg/d based on baseline weight), or fluoxetine (20 mg/d). The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Secondary efficacy endpoints included week 8 Clinical Global Impressions–Severity, Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement (CGI-I), and response (CGI-I ≤ 2). Safety assessments included adverse events, physical and vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.</p><p><bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> The safety population included 339 patients (children, <italic>n</italic> = 130; adolescents, <italic>n</italic> = 209). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, did not statistically separate from placebo, for either desvenlafaxine (adjusted mean [standard error] change, −22.6 [1.17]) or fluoxetine (−24.8 [1.17]; placebo, −23.1 [1.18]). Week 8 CGI-I response rates were significantly greater for fluoxetine (78.2%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.017) than for placebo (62.6%); desvenlafaxine (68.7%) did not differ from placebo. Other secondary outcomes were consistent with those obtained with CDRS-R. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable among treatment groups (desvenlafaxine, 60.0%; placebo, 70.5%; and fluoxetine, 64.3%). </p><p><bold><italic>Conclusion:</italic></bold> Desvenlafaxine did not demonstrate efficacy for treating MDD in children and adolescents in this trial. Because neither desvenlafaxine nor the reference medication, fluoxetine, demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo on the primary endpoint, this was considered a failed trial and no efficacy conclusions can be drawn. Desvenlafaxine 25–50 mg/d was generally safe and well tolerated in children and adolescents in this study.</p></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 340 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 339 patients (children, <italic>n</italic> = 130; adolescents, <italic>n</italic> = 209) were included in the safety population (desvenlafaxine, <italic>n</italic> = 115; fluoxetine, <italic>n</italic> = 112; placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 112).

Lost to follow-up was the most common reason for discontinuation from the desvenlafaxine and placebo groups; in the fluoxetine group, the most common reason for discontinuation was “no longer willing to participate” (<xref>Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig><label><bold>FIG. 1.</bold></label><caption><p>Study flow. <sup>a</sup>One patient was screened and, although not randomized, received a total of eight blinded placebo doses.

A total of 29/337 (8.6%) patients had treatment-emergent suicidal ideation, and 1 patient (0.3%) also had treatment-emergent suicidal behavior. The suicidal behavior event was categorized as a preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior (preparatory acts or behavior; interrupted attempt) and was reported in a fluoxetine-treated adolescent (<xref>Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The patient was discontinued due to a serious AE of acute suicidality (described in “Deaths and Serious AEs” section).</p><table-wrap><label><sc>Table</sc> 4.</label><caption><p><sc>Summary of Treatment-Emergent Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Reported on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale at Any Postbaseline Assessment, Safety Population</sc></p></caption><table><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th> </th><th><italic>Placebo (</italic>N<italic> = 112)</italic></th><th><italic>Fluoxetine (</italic>N<italic> = 110)</italic></th><th><italic>Desvenlafaxine (</italic>N<italic> = 115)</italic></th><th><italic>Total (</italic>N<italic> = 337)</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Treatment-emergent SIB<sup><xref>a</xref></sup></td><td>8/112 (7.1)</td><td>12/110 (10.9)</td><td>9/115 (7.8)</td><td>29/337 (8.6)</td></tr><tr><td> New-onset SIB<sup><xref>b</xref></sup></td><td>7/104 (6.7)</td><td>10/97 (10.3)</td><td>8/102 (7.8)</td><td>25/303 (8.3)</td></tr><tr><td> Worsening SIB<sup><xref>c</xref></sup></td><td>1/8 (12.5)</td><td>2/13 (15.4)</td><td>1/13 (7.7)</td><td>4/34 (11.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment-emergent SI<sup><xref>d</xref></sup></td><td>8/112 (7.1)</td><td>12/110 (10.9)</td><td>9/115 (7.8)</td><td>29/337 (8.6)</td></tr><tr><td> New-onset SI<sup><xref>e</xref></sup></td><td>7/104 (6.7)</td><td>10/97 (10.3)</td><td>8/102 (7.8)</td><td>25/303 (8.3)</td></tr><tr><td>  Wish to be dead</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>  Nonspecific active suicidal thoughts</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>  Active SI with any methods (no plan) without intent to act</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td> Worsening SI<sup><xref>f</xref></sup></td><td>1/8 (12.5)</td><td>2/13 (15.4)</td><td>1/13 (7.7)</td><td>4/34 (11.8)</td></tr><tr><td>  Shift to nonspecific active suicidal thoughts</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>  Shift to active SI with any methods (no plan) without intent to act</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>  Shift to active SI with specific plan and intent</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment-emergent SB<sup><xref>g</xref></sup></td><td>0/112 (0.0)</td><td>1/110 (0.9)</td><td>0/115 (0.0)</td><td>1/337 (0.3)</td></tr><tr><td> New-onset SB<sup><xref>h</xref></sup></td><td>0/112 (0.0)</td><td>1/110 (0.9)</td><td>0/115 (0.0)</td><td>1/337 (0.3)</td></tr><tr><td>  Interrupted attempt</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> Worsening SB<sup><xref>i</xref></sup></td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>There was one poststudy suicide attempt reported as a serious adverse event that was not captured on the C-SSRS;
