<abstract><sec><title>Objective</title><p> The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of an ultra-low-dose vaginal estriol 0.03 mg in combination with viable <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> KS400 (Gynoflor<sup>®</sup> vaginal tablets) in the short-term therapy and to investigate the long-term maintenance dose in the treatment of vaginal atrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p> This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (Controlled phase <italic>–</italic> initial therapy) followed by an open-label follow-up (Open phase – test medication initial and maintenance therapy). Included were postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy symptoms and Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) of ≤ 40%. The method of treatment was initial therapy with test medication (or placebo in first phase), one vaginal tablet daily for 12 days, followed by maintenance therapy, one tablet on two consecutive days weekly for 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> A total of 87 women completed the study. The Controlled phase results for a change in VMI demonstrated superiority of the 0.03 mg estriol–lactobacilli combination to placebo (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In the test group, the positive change in VMI was 35.2%, compared to 9.9% in the placebo group. In the Open phase after the initial therapy, the VMI was increased to 55.4% and, during maintenance therapy, it stayed at a comparable level (52.8–49.4%). The maturation of epithelium was followed by improvement of clinical symptoms and normalization of the vaginal ecosystem.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p> The ultra-low-dose, vaginal 0.03 mg estriol–lactobacilli combination (Gynoflor<sup>®</sup>) was superior to placebo with respect to changes in VMI after the 12-day initial therapy, and the maintenance therapy of two tablets weekly was sufficient to prevent the relapse of vaginal atrophy.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>An overview of subject disposition is given in <xref>Figure 2</xref>. A total of 87 women completed both phases of the study as scheduled. Reasons for discontinuation were premature discontinuation at their own request or failure to show up at control visits. One woman in the placebo group withdrew her consent before visit C1 and was excluded from the ITT population due to no data. Another woman in the placebo group was excluded from the PPS population due to prior termination of the study after visit C1. During the Open phase, there was another major protocol violation as the woman did not comply with the treatment. All randomized subjects were part of the SAF population.</p><fig><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Disposition of subjects, Controlled phase.

The number of women who reported having intercourse was too low for a valid statistical analysis of dyspareunia (E: approximately 45%, C1 and C2: 11–21%). The percentage with moderate or severe dyspareunia at E was 84% in the estriol–lactobacilli combination group and 90% in the placebo group. The corresponding numbers at C1 were 40% for both groups, and at C2 -0% in the estriol–lactobacilli combination group and 22% in the placebo group. Individual results for dyspareunia, abnormal discharge, pruritus, and soreness therefore were not significantly different between the estriol–lactobacilli combination and placebo groups.</p><fig><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Dynamics of vaginal symptoms, Controlled phase.

The total symptom score improved during estriol–lactobacilli combination therapy compared to placebo: at C1 without significant difference, and at C2 with significant difference. The percentages of the increase of superficial cells and the decrease of parabasal cells showed a similar dynamic: at C1 there were no significant differences between the groups; however, at C2 significant improvements in favor of the estriol–lactobacilli combination were observed. The number of lactobacilli and LBG also improved in both groups at C1, with no significant difference between the groups. But again, the corresponding results at C2 were significantly better in the test medication group. The mean vaginal pH decreased significantly more in the estriol–lactobacilli combination group as compared to placebo both at C1 and at C2. The global efficacy of the estriol–lactobacilli combination by investigator was significantly better than that of placebo, both at C1 and at C2. The rating by the patient was not significantly different at C1, but at C2 was significantly better for the test group.</p><table-wrap><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Secondary efficacy and safety variables in the Controlled phase.
