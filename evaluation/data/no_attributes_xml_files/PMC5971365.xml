<abstract><sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), with cognitive processing speed being the most frequently affected domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective:</title><p>Examine the effects of daclizumab beta versus intramuscular (IM) interferon (IFN) beta-1a on cognitive processing speed as assessed by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In DECIDE, patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) (age: 18–55 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 0–5.0) were randomized to daclizumab beta ( <italic>n</italic> = 919) or IM IFN beta-1a ( <italic>n</italic> = 922) for 96–144 weeks.

Significantly more patients treated with daclizumab beta showed clinically meaningful improvement in SDMT (increase from baseline of ⩾3 points ( <italic>p</italic> = 0.0153) or ⩾4 points ( <italic>p</italic> = 0.0366)), and significantly fewer patients showed clinically meaningful worsening (decrease from baseline of ⩾3 points ( <italic>p</italic> = 0.0103)).
