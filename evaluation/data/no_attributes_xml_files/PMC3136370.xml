<abstract><p>Most patients with fibromyalgia use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Properly designed controlled trials are necessary to assess the effectiveness of these practices. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, early phase trial. Fifty patients seen at a fibromyalgia outpatient treatment program were randomly assigned to a daily soy or placebo (casein) shake. Outcome measures were scores of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention. Analysis was with standard statistics based on the null hypothesis, and separation test for early phase CAM comparative trials. Twenty-eight patients completed the study. Use of standard statistics with intent-to-treat analysis showed that total FIQ scores decreased by 14% in the soy group (<italic>P</italic> = .02) and by 18% in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The difference in change in scores between the groups was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = .16). With the same analysis, CES-D scores decreased in the soy group by 16% (<italic>P</italic> = .004) and in the placebo group by 15% (<italic>P</italic> = .05). The change in scores was similar in the groups (<italic>P</italic> = .83). Results of statistical analysis using the separation test and intent-to-treat analysis revealed no benefit of soy compared with placebo. Shakes that contain soy and shakes that contain casein, when combined with a multidisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program, provide a decrease in fibromyalgia symptoms. Separation between the effects of soy and casein (control) shakes did not favor the intervention. Therefore, large-sample studies using soy for patients with fibromyalgia are probably not indicated.</p></abstract><sec><title>3. Results</title><sec><title>3.1. Baseline Characteristics</title><p>A total of 50 patients (49 women) were recruited for this trial. Median age was 47.7 years (range, 18–76 years). There was no significant difference in age (<italic>P</italic> = .99), FIQ scores (<italic>P</italic> = .36) or CES-D scores (<italic>P</italic> = .48) between the two groups. Twenty-eight patients (56%)—12 in the soy group and 16 in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = .39)—completed the 6-week trial. Reasons for not completing it are depicted in <xref>Figure 1</xref>. Patients who did not finish the trial were significantly younger (median age, 39.8 years) than those who finished it (median age, 53.9 years) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The median FIQ score was higher for patients who did not complete the trial (59.5) than for those who completed the study (54.8), but the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .12). The median CES-D score also was higher for patients who did not complete the trial (26.5) than for patients who completed the trial (14.0), but this also was not a statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .14).</p></sec><sec><title>3.2. Between-Group Comparisons</title><p>With intent-to-treat analysis, the total FIQ scores determined at study entry and at study completion decreased 14% (±29) in the soy group and 18% (±25) in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = .16). With per-protocol analysis, the total FIQ scores decreased 29% (±36) in the soy group and 28% (±26) in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = .93) (<xref>Figure 2</xref>). No statistically significant decrease between the soy group and the placebo group was observed for any of the FIQ subclass scores. With intent-to-treat analysis, the CES-D scores improved 16% (±26) in the soy group and 15% (±41) in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = .83); with per-protocol analysis, the CES-D scores improved 33% (±30) in the soy group and 24% (±50) in the placebo group (<xref>Figure 3</xref>). However, the decrease between the groups was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .96). Using various cutoff points for depression (CES-D ≥ 16, CES-D ≥ 19 and CES-D ≥ 27) and intent-to-treat analysis, we found a depression rate of 52%, 48% and 28%, respectively, in the soy group and 52%, 48% and 32% in the control group at study entry. After 6 weeks, these percentages were 48%, 44% and 24% in the treatment group and 48%, 36% and 24% in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups (<italic>P</italic> = 1.00). Determined by using per-protocol analysis for these three different CES-D scores, the percentages of patients with depression at study entry in the treatment group were 42%, 33% and 8% and in the control group were 38%, 38% and 19%. After 6 weeks, 33% of the treatment group had CES-D scores of 16 or greater, 25% had scores of 19 or greater and 0% had scores of 27 or greater. The percentages for the control group were 31%, 19% and 6%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. </p><p>The separation test using the difference from baseline to 6 weeks showed no benefit for soy, as determined by FIQ scores and CES-D scores for both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. We did not have enough information to make any recommendation for or against the use of soy using the separation test per-protocol analysis based on total FIQ scores (<xref>Table 1</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>3.3. Within-Group Comparisons</title><p>Significant, but modest, improvement in total FIQ scores (soy group, <italic>P</italic> = .02; placebo group, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref>Figure 2</xref>) and CES-D scores (soy group, <italic>P</italic> = .004; placebo group, <italic>P</italic> = .05) (<xref>Figure 3</xref>) between study entry and study completion was seen in both groups. Using three different cutoff points for depression (CES-D ≥ 16, CES-D ≥ 19 and CES-D ≥ 27), we found no significant improvement using the McNemar test for the soy and control groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .50).</p><sec><title>3.3.1.
