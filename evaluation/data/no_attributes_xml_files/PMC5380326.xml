<abstract><p>Vitamin D deficiency was common among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and had negative influence on treatment outcome. Correction of vitamin D deficiency improved treatment response. Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) involved in inflammatory responses in CHC. Their higher levels at pretreatment of CHC could predict poorer responses. Vitamin D suppressed expression of IP-10 from monocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. In CHC patients, DPP IV involved in IP-10 regulation. We hypothesized that correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in CHC patients might restore immune dysregulation through a pathway linked to the TH1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 or DPP IV. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 80 CHC patients with vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were assigned to receive vitamin D (40) or placebo (40) supplements for 6 weeks. The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], Th1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 and DPP IV were measured at baseline and at the 6th week. At the end of study, the mean 25(OH)D level in vitamin D group was significantly increased and normalised. There were no changes in the level of Th1/Th2 cytokines. Our important finding revealed that upon correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, the serum IP-10 and DPP IV levels were decreased significantly as compare to the placebo group (delta changes; 83.27 vs -133.80; 95% CI [-326.910, -40.758], p = 0.0125, and 271.04 vs -518.69; 95% CI [-1179,15, -59.781], p = 0.0305, respectively. As previous evidences suggested that each factor individually influenced and predicted outcome of CHC treatment. Our results offer a new insight and help to piece the puzzle of vitamin D deficiency, IP-10 and DPP IV together in CHC.</p><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold> Thai Clinical Trials Registry TCTR20160429001</p></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study patients at baseline</title><p>From January to December 2014, 80 patients were included into this study and randomly assigned to receive a placebo (n = 40) vitamin D supplement (n = 40). 42 patients were naïve cases without previous CHC treatment and 38 patients were previously failed therapy either relapsers or non-responders.
