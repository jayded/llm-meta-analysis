<abstract><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>Increased awareness of the importance of dietary fibre has led to increased interest in “functional” fibre components like digestion-resistant maltodextrin (RMD). This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study assessed the effects of RMD in the colonic transit time (CTT) and defecation characteristics (frequency, stool volume and consistency).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty-six healthy adult volunteers (32 men) who did not have a daily defecation habit had a 7-day run-in period before the 21-day intervention period with RMD or placebo. CTT and segmental CTT (SCTT) were assessed by a single abdominal X-ray film taken at the end of both periods after radiopaque marker ingestion. Defecation characteristics and intestinal functions were also assessed, which were self-reported by patients. Intragroup comparisons were evaluated by Student’s paired <italic>t</italic> test, Bonferroni test and Chi-square test, while time comparisons by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and time-by-treatment interaction by repeated-measures ANOVA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifty-seven subjects were assessed for CTT (placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 28; RMD, <italic>n</italic> = 29). In the RMD group, the total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT decreased significantly compared to baseline (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 each; −13.3, −4.7, −8.7 h, respectively). Significant differences between groups were observed in total CTT and left SCTT. Significant time-by-treatment interaction was observed in the RMD group for stool volume (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014), increasing 56 % compared to baseline (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), while remained unchanged in the placebo group. Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). No adverse effects related to study products were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results show that RMD improved CTT, stool volume, stool consistency and some intestinal functions in a healthy population.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline data</title><p>A total of 73 candidates were assessed for eligibility, and 67 subjects met the criteria and were randomly allocated into two groups. One subject was withdrawn during the run-in period before receiving intervention (Fig. <xref>1</xref>). Thus, a total of 66 subjects were analysed, 33 in each study group. The demographic and other baseline characteristics of subjects in each group are outlined in Table <xref>1</xref>. Briefly, the population was 51.5 % female with the mean age of 21.3 years and the mean BMI 23.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The two study groups were well balanced with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics, and no significant difference was found in any of the variables between groups. The mean daily fibre intake was 10.0 ± 4.6 g in the RMD group and 11.5 ± 4.6 g in the placebo group. Overall, no significant differences in the diet were observed between groups.<fig><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Disposition of subjects for placebo (maltodextrin) and digestion-resistant maltodextrin (RMD) groups</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographics and baseline characteristics of subjects</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 33)</th><th>RMD (<italic>n</italic> = 33)</th><th>Total (<italic>n</italic> = 66)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Female, <italic>n</italic> (%)</td><td>17 (51.5)</td><td>17 (51.5)</td><td>34 (51.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Age (years)<sup>a</sup></td><td>21.5 ± 3.2</td><td>21.1 ± 2.4</td><td>21.3 ± 2.8</td></tr><tr><td>Height (m)<sup>a</sup></td><td>1.73 ± 0.1</td><td>1.72 ± 0.1</td><td>1.7 ± 0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (kg)<sup>a</sup></td><td>70.3 ± 14.0</td><td>67.5 ± 12.3</td><td>69.0 ± 13.1</td></tr><tr><td>BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)<sup>a</sup></td><td>23.3 ± 3.0</td><td>22.7 ± 3.0</td><td>23.0 ± 3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Smoker, <italic>n</italic> (%)</td><td>10 (30.3)</td><td>8 (24.2)</td><td>18 (27.3)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>RMD</italic> digestion-resistant maltodextrin, <italic>m</italic> metres, <italic>kg</italic> kilograms, <italic>BMI</italic> body mass index, <italic>n</italic> number of subjects                             </p><p><sup>a</sup>Values expressed as mean ± SD (standard deviation)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec><title>Colonic transit time</title><p>Although 66 subjects completed the study, 9 subjects (5 in placebo and 4 in RMD groups) failed to complete CTT determination due to non-compliance.

By contrast, the stool volume evolved differently between two groups.

Furthermore, there was a significant time-by-treatment interaction observed in stool volume (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014). Based on the Bristol Scale Score self-recorded, a significant increase (softer and better stool consistency) was observed in the RMD group after 3 weeks (21.4 %, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) compared to baseline. No change was observed in the placebo group for the stool consistency.
