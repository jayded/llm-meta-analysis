<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Concern that mild iodine deficiency in pregnancy may adversely affect neurodevelopment of offspring has led to recommendations for iodine supplementation in the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the effect of iodine supplementation during pregnancy on childhood neurodevelopment. Secondary outcomes included pregnancy outcomes, maternal thyroid function and general health.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Women with a singleton pregnancy of fewer than 20 weeks were randomly assigned to iodine (150 μg/d) or placebo from trial entry to birth. Childhood neurodevelopment was assessed at 18 months by using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III). Iodine status and thyroid function were assessed at baseline and at 36 weeks’ gestation. Pregnancy outcomes were collected from medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The trial was stopped after 59 women were randomly assigned following withdrawal of support by the funding body. There were no differences in childhood neurodevelopmental scores between the iodine treated and placebo groups. The mean cognitive, language and motor scores on the Bayley-III (iodine versus placebo, respectively) were 99.4 ± 12.2 versus 101.7 ± 8.2 (mean difference (MD) −2.3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) −7.8, 3.2; <italic> P</italic> = 0.42), 97.2 ± 12.2 versus 97.9 ± 11.5 (MD −0.7, 95 % CI −7.0, 5.6; <italic> P</italic> = 0.83) and 93.9 ± 10.8 versus 92.4 ± 9.7 (MD 1.4, 95 % CI −4.0, 6.9; <italic>P</italic> = 0.61), respectively. No differences were identified between groups in any secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Iodine supplementation in pregnancy did not result in better childhood neurodevelopment in this small trial. Adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed to provide conclusive evidence regarding the effect of iodine supplementation in pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trials registration</title><p>The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry at <ext-link>http://www.anzctr.org.au</ext-link>.

A total of 59 out of 205 (29 %) women were enrolled in the study from the Women’s &amp; Children’s Hospital and the Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide, Australia, between June 2010 and October 2010 (Fig. <xref>1</xref>). Twenty-nine were randomly allocated to iodine and 30 to placebo (Fig. <xref>1</xref>). The baseline demographic characteristics of the participants are listed in Table <xref>1</xref>. The trial was stopped early, before recruitment began in other Australian centres and New Zealand, because the funding body (NHMRC) withdrew its support for the trial. The NHMRC considered a placebo-controlled trial inconsistent with its recommendation for iodine supplementation in pregnancy. The ethics committees did not withdraw approval for the trial, but in view of the funding body’s position it supported the trial management committee’s decision to unblind the study and to follow all randomly assigned women as planned to monitor safety. Women were informed of their treatment group allocation and were provided with a copy of the NHMRC recommendation for iodine supplementation in pregnancy [<xref>9</xref>]. All women except two (one from each group) consented to continue with the follow-up after unblinding. The mean gestational age at unblinding was 33 ± 7 weeks. The mean duration of intervention before unblinding was 16 weeks (range 2–23 weeks). Nine (31 %) women in the iodine group and 4 (13 %) in the placebo group gave birth before unblinding. The decision regarding whether to continue taking trial supplements or to take commercially available iodine supplements was at the women’s discretion. Five women in the iodine group and 18 in the placebo group stopped taking trial supplements. Only one woman in the placebo group commenced iodine supplements after unblinding.<fig><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant flowchart</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline demographic characteristics</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Iodine (<italic>n</italic> = 29)</th><th>Placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 30)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age at trial entry, years<sup>a</sup></td><td>29.1 (5.7)</td><td>29.8 (5.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Gestational age at trial entry, weeks<sup>a</sup></td><td>15.2 (2.6)</td><td>14.9 (2.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Primiparous<sup>b</sup></td><td>13 (44.8)</td><td>13 (43.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Completed secondary education<sup>b</sup></td><td>20 (69.0)</td><td>22 (73.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Completed further education<sup>b</sup></td><td>22 (75.9)</td><td>24 (80.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Smoke at trial entry or leading up to pregnancy<sup>b</sup></td><td>7 (24.1)</td><td>5 (16.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Miscarriage in previous pregnancy<sup>b</sup></td><td>8 (27.6)</td><td>12 (40.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Previous or current depression<sup>b</sup></td><td>4 (13.8)</td><td>7 (23.3)</td></tr><tr><td>BMI at trial entry<sup>a</sup></td><td>25.3 (5.9)</td><td>23.6 (3.9)</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-pregnancy BMI<sup>a</sup></td><td>23.6 (5.5)</td><td>22.2 (4.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Infant sex: male<sup>b</sup></td><td>20 (71.4)</td><td>9 (31.0)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>BMI</italic> body mass index</p><p><sup>a</sup>Data are presented as mean (standard deviation)</p><p><sup>b</sup>Data are presented as number (percentage)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><sec><title>Neurodevelopment of children</title><p>The mean composite score of the children did not differ between the iodine and the placebo groups in cognitive (99.4 ± 12.2 versus 101.7 ± 8.2, mean difference (MD): −2.3; 95 % confidence interval (CI) −7.8, 3.2; <italic>P</italic> = 0.42), language (97.2 ± 12.2 versus 97.9 ± 11.5, MD −0.7; 95 % CI −7.0, 5.6; <italic> P</italic> = 0.83) or motor (93.9 ± 10.8 versus 92.4 ± 9.7, MD 1.4; 95 % CI −4.0, 6.9; <italic>P</italic> = 0.61) development (Table <xref>2</xref>).
