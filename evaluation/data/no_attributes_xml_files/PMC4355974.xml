<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Asthma is the most common chronic condition of childhood and disproportionately affects inner-city minority children. Low rates of asthma preventer medication adherence is a major contributor to poor asthma control in these patients. Web-based methods have potential to improve patient knowledge and medication adherence by providing interactive patient education, monitoring of symptoms and medication use, and by facilitation of communication and teamwork among patients and health care providers. Few studies have evaluated web-based asthma support environments using all of these potentially beneficial interventions. The multidimensional website created for this study, BostonBreathes, was designed to intervene on multiple levels, and was evaluated in a pilot trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An interactive, engaging website for children with asthma was developed to promote adherence to asthma medications, provide a platform for teamwork between caregivers and patients, and to provide primary care providers with up-to-date symptom information and data on medication use. Fifty-eight (58) children primarily from inner city Boston with persistent-level asthma were randomised to either usual care or use of BostonBreathes. Subjects completed asthma education activities, and reported their symptoms and medication use. Primary care providers used a separate interface to monitor their patients’ website use, their reported symptoms and medication use, and were able to communicate online via a discussion board with their patients and with an asthma specialist.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 6-months, reported wheezing improved significantly in both intervention and control groups, and there were significant improvements in the intervention group only in night-time awakening and parental loss of sleep, but there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups in these measures. Emergency room or acute visits to a physician for asthma did not significantly change in either group. Among the subgroup of subjects with low controller medication adherence at baseline, adherence improved significantly only in the intervention group. Knowledge of the purpose of controller medicine increased significantly in the intervention group, a statistically significant improvement over the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot study suggests that a multidimensional web-based educational, monitoring, and communication platform may have positive influences on pediatric patients’ asthma-related knowledge and use of asthma preventer medications.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>983 children with asthma were identified through automated medical record review. Of these, 520 (52.9%) were able to be reached and had an eligible physician, 391 (75.2%) completed a phone screening, and 89 (22.8%) were deemed eligible for the study. Of the 89 eligible subjects, 31 declined to participate leaving 58 (65%) enrolled with 21 randomized to the control group, and 37 randomized to the intervention group.

The other subjects were lost to follow-up before the 6 month end point. Analysis of the randomness of missing data for days of wheeze, days had to slow down, nights woke-up, days limited activity, days parent lose sleep and days missed school for asthma using the permutation test indicated no significant dependence of drop out on the outcome values. Thirteen [ <xref>13</xref> ] physicians and 1 NP participated in the study of whom 61% were female, the mean age was 45 years old, 95% were located in an urban practice area, 22% were family physicians and 78% were pediatricians or pediatric NP.</p><p>Characteristics of the subjects are described in Table  <xref>1</xref> . Overall, 58.6% of subjects were African-American, and 32.6% of household reported earning less than $15,000 per year. Most subjects (87.5%) had some form of health insurance. Parents of control subjects were slightly more likely to report high school education or above (78.4% of intervention subject parents, versus 100% of control parents, P = 0.041). <table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Sample Characteristics</bold></p></caption><table><thead><tr><th><bold>Characteristic</bold></th><th><bold>Intervention, (N = 37)</bold></th><th><bold>Control, (N = 21)</bold></th><th><bold>P</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>Demographics</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Age (years)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>11.9 ± 2.0</td><td>12.9 ± 3.0</td><td>0.13</td></tr><tr><td>Median and Range</td><td>12 (8–16)</td><td>14 (7–17)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Male gender</td><td>22 (59.5%)</td><td>12 (57.1%)</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Race</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hispanic</td><td>4 (10.8%)</td><td>2 (9.5%)</td><td>0.70</td></tr><tr><td>Black</td><td>20 (54.1%)</td><td>14 (66.7%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>White</td><td>8 (21.6%)</td><td>2 (9.5%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>5 (13.5%)</td><td>3 (14.3%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Parental Education: at least High School completion</td><td>29 (78.4%)</td><td>20 (100%)</td><td>0.041</td></tr><tr><td>Employed caregiver in household</td><td>29 (78.4%)</td><td>13 (61.9%)</td><td>0.23</td></tr><tr><td>Total family Income under $15,000</td><td>9 (28.1%)</td><td>6 (42.9%)</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td>Child covered by health insurance</td><td>32 (91.4%)</td><td>17 (81%)</td><td>0.41</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Home Environment</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cockroaches at home</td><td>8 (22.9%)</td><td>7 (33.3%)</td><td>0.53</td></tr><tr><td>Dog at home</td><td>6 (17.1%)</td><td>3 (14.3%)</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Cat at home</td><td>6 (17.1%)</td><td>9 (42.9%)</td><td>0.06</td></tr><tr><td>Pet rodent at home</td><td>3 (8.6%)</td><td>2 (9.5%)</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Smokers at home</td><td>8 (22.9%)</td><td>9 (42.9%)</td><td>0.14</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Computer Use</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Computer Competence Score, self reported (1–5), Mean (SD)</td><td>4.3 ± 0.6</td><td>4.6 ± 0.5</td><td>0.07</td></tr><tr><td>Hours/day on computer, Mean (SD)</td><td>2.0 + 1.8</td><td>1.6 + 1.6</td><td>0.51</td></tr><tr><td>Type of Internet Connection</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dial-Up</td><td>10 (32.3%)</td><td>2 (13.3%)</td><td>0.29</td></tr><tr><td>Broadband</td><td>21 (67.7%)</td><td>13 (86.7%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Able to log onto Boston Breathes website</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>With assistance</td><td>2 (7.1%)</td><td>2 (11.1%)</td><td>0.64</td></tr><tr><td>Without assistance</td><td>26 (92.9%)</td><td>16 (88.9%)</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Intervention subjects accessed the BostonBreathes site on average 7 times per month in the first month of the study, with decrease over time (Figure  <xref>3</xref> ). <fig><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Subject Logins to BostonBreathes Website, by Month.</bold></p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig></p><sec><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>Reported days of wheezing improved in both groups at the 6- month endpoint (−1.4 days of wheezing per 2 weeks in intervention subjects, and −4.2 days in control subjects), and patient awakening and parental loss of sleep improved significantly only in the intervention group (−0.8 and −0.6 days change per 2 weeks respectively at 6 months).

They reported strong satisfaction with BB with all domains generating mean agreement ratings of 8.5 or higher, on a Likert scale of 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree), including: the ease of use of the website (8.4), good looking appearance (8.5), usefulness of information (9.2), and ease of learning the system (8.5). Twenty-four percent (24%) of subjects reported never using the website with a parent, 48% reported sometimes doing so, and 28% reported often or always using the website with a parent.</p><p>Results of the provider survey on experience with BB are shown in Table  <xref>5</xref> . Providers tended toward agreement that BB provided useful information; was easy to use; that their patients benefited from using BB; and that the asthma specialist feedback was useful. Responses were neutral on effectiveness of the discussion board for communication with patients, and on average, expressed neutral to slight disagreement on adequacy of time available to use BB, and if they had changed management based on BB data. Open-ended comments grouped into three consistent themes: the observation that BB improved communication with patients, the advantages of having access to information on patient asthma status on a more immediate, day to day, basis; and that the time commitment to use the system was a concern. <table-wrap><label>Table 5</label><caption><p><bold>Post-project Provider Attitudes Towards BostonBreathes</bold></p></caption><table><thead><tr><th><bold>Attitude statement</bold></th><th><bold>Mean*, N = 14</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BostonBreathes provided me with useful information about my patient(s) that I would not have had otherwise.</td><td>6.5</td></tr><tr><td>The BostonBreathes website was easy to use.</td><td>6.9</td></tr><tr><td>I had enough time in my schedule to use BostonBreathes.</td><td>4.6</td></tr><tr><td>I changed the asthma management of my patient(s) based on data from the site.</td><td>4.6</td></tr><tr><td>It was easy to remember to login to BostonBreathes.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>I would recommend that other MDs use BostonBreathes for their asthma patients</td><td>5.6</td></tr><tr><td>BostonBreathes is best for severe asthmatics only.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>I trusted the information being entered by my patient(s).</td><td>5.7</td></tr><tr><td>I believe my patient(s) benefited from using the BostonBreathes website.</td><td>6.6</td></tr><tr><td>I would recommend BostonBreathes for my asthmatic patients.</td><td>6.2</td></tr><tr><td>The discussion board was an effective way to communicate with my patient(s).</td><td>5.6</td></tr><tr><td>The feedback from Asthma Specialist posted to the discussion board was useful in helping me to manage my asthma patient(s).</td><td>6.3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*All answers rated on Likert scale 0-10 (0=Strongly Disagree to 10=Strongly Agree).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>On average, subjects earned $6 (range, $0-$40) in incentive payments for website use over the 6 month participation period, plus $15.00 total in payments for completing pre and post study surveys.</p></sec></sec>
