<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Data about the vaccination status of participants are required in
    epidemiological cohort studies whenever infection or immunity is considered
    as potential exposure or outcome. Within Pretest 2 of the German National
    Cohort (GNC) we therefore investigated the acceptance and feasibility of
    extracting vaccination status from vaccination certificates provided by the
    participants of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in three study centers (Bremen,
    n = 73; Hamburg, n = 200; Hannover,
    n = 193). In order to test if an additional reminder would
    prevent participants from forgetting their vaccination certificates at home
    persons willing to participate in Pretest 2 were randomly assigned to one of
    three invitation groups (IG). About one third of the participants received
    either no further reminder (IG1), a reminder card together with the
    appointment letter (IG2) or a separate reminder card 4 days before the
    appointment (IG3). At the study center, vaccination data were scanned or
    copied and entered into a database using a unique identification number.
    Participants were also asked to fill in a short questionnaire to assess the
    completeness of the provided vaccination data. Additionally, in one of the
    three participating study centers, general practitioners (GP) were asked to
    provide vaccination data from their records following respective
    participants’ consent. Finally, we compared the influenza data from
    the vaccination certificates with the influenza data obtained from
    participants in Pretest 2 by use of a self-administered questionnaire
    (ID-Screen).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Due to different starting dates of the study the intended reminder procedure was
    implemented only in Hamburg and Hannover. In Hamburg, significantly more vaccination
    certificates were submitted by the group which received the reminder card separately 4
    days before the examination (IG3) compared to IG1 and IG2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04).
    In Hannover, in contrast, most vaccination certificates were brought by those who
    received the reminder card together with the appointment letter. Overall, the use of a
    reminder card had a positive but not significant effect as 89 % (185/209) of
    participants who received the reminder card submitted vaccination data versus
    81 % (84/104) of participants who did not receive any reminder card (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06).
    Of all Pretest 2 participants in Hannover, 62 % (120/193) gave written consent
    for data collection by the GPs. In total, 114 practices were contacted of which 49
    (43 %) sent vaccination data. All in all, 360 vaccination certificates with 5065
    documented vaccinations were entered into a database, of which 4830 (95 %) were
    valid for analysis covering a period from 1946 to 2012. The comparison of influenza
    vaccination data from vaccination certificates to the remembered data from a
    self-completed questionnaire showed an agreement of data in 46 % (84/184) of
    cases (Kappa = 0.48). Influenza vaccinations were underreported in
    4 % (7/170) of self-completed questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The reliable documentation of vaccinations within the context of the GNC
    proved to be feasible and thus recommendable at a large scale within the GNC
    as participants showed high willingness and compliance in providing
    available vaccination documents. An additional validation by means of
    documents provided by physicians seems to be possible for more than a
    quarter of participants. In order to maximize the likelyhood of
    participants’ of bringing their vaccination certificates it would be
    sufficient to send a reminder card together with the appointment letter.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi: 10.1007/s00103-014-2050-0) contains
    supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participation</title><p>The recruitment process for this feasibility study differed among the participating study
    centers. On the one hand, the invitation procedure consisting of three different
    invitation groups was implemented in Hamburg and Hannover only, due to a later starting
    date in Bremen. Consequently, all participants in Bremen invited to Pretest 2
    received by default the reminder card together with the appointment letter. On the other
    hand, participation proportions for this feasibility study could be calculated for
    Hannover only, as in Bremen and Hamburg the consent for the vaccination data collection
    was integrated into the consent form of the Pretest 2 baseline assessment
    whereas in Hannover participants were asked for a separate consent. Recruitment data and
    participation proportions per invitation group are shown in Fig. <xref>2</xref>. The participation proportions of the random
    samples are of special interest because the study protocol for the GNC allows random
    samples only; therefore, participation proportions will be discussed mainly in this
    respect. Overall, 400 persons were invited to participate in this feasibility
    study. In Hannover, 92.2 % (153/166) of Pretest 2 participants gave a
    separate written consent for the vaccination data collection. Again 92.2 %
    (141/153) of these participants brought vaccination certificates to the appointment. In
    Hamburg and Bremen, where participants were not explicitly asked for their willingness
    to participate in this feasibility study, the proportion of provided vaccination
    certificates was slightly lower: 80.0 % (128/160, one missing) of invited
    persons in Hamburg and 75.3 % (55/73) in Bremen provided vaccination data.</p><p><fig><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the recruitment and submitted vaccination certificates. <italic>

    (185/209) of participants who received a reminder card (regardless if IG2 or IG3)
    brought their vaccination certificate compared to 81 % (84/104) of those who did
    not receive any reminder card (IG1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.06). The
    approach to send a separate reminder card 4 days before the appointment was the
    most successful; 92 % (94/102) participants of IG3 provided vaccination data
    compared to 85 % (91/107) in IG2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06).
    Stratifications by study center indicated that in Hannover participants in IG2 provided
    the most vaccination certificates (95 %), whereas in Hamburg, significantly more
    vaccination certificates (92 %) were provided in IG3, with no differences
    between IG1 and IG2 (chi-square<sup>2</sup>: 6.546, df 2, <italic>
        p</italic> = 0.04).</p></sec><sec><title>Data provided by physicians</title><p>Of 193 Pretest 2 participants in Hannover, 120 (62 %) provided
    written consent for the data collection by general practitioners. In one case
    the consent was given but the participant had not been in contact with the
    health care system for a long time so that he could not provide any GP address.
    In total, 114 practices were contacted of which 43 % (49/114)
    sent vaccination data. Two practices did not send any data because no
    vaccination was given during the past 10 years. In most cases the
    medical staff filled in the paper documentation sheet, with a few providing
    computerized print-outs.</p></sec><sec><title>Questionnaire</title><p>The short questionnaire was completed by 94.7 % (426/450) of participants
    including the convenience sample. There were considerable differences between
    the study centers. Whereas in Hamburg all participants completed the
    questionnaire (200/200), this was the case for 98.9 % (175/177) of the
    participants in Hannover, and for only 70 % (51/73) in Bremen (data
    shown in supplement). Thorough data cleaning was necessary because of
    inconsistent responses. For example, the question, if the participant ever
    possessed a vaccination certificate was denied by 16 persons of whom
    5 persons submitted their vaccination certificate to the study personnel
    the same day. A problem seemed to exist also if more than one vaccination
    certificate existed so that participants were not sure to which one to refer.
    Moreover the high percentage of missing answers for most questions, coded as
    “don’t know/no answer”, suggests that these questions
    were difficult to remember and thus not suitable for a self-administered
    questionnaire.</p><p>Of all participants, 96 % had possessed a vaccination certificate once
    during their life-time, with 91 % possessing one at the moment. There
    were no differences between random and convenience samples. In all, 37 %
    of responders indicated that the present vaccination certificate was the first,
    whereas for 55 % of responders it was the second up to fourth
    vaccination certificate. In addition, 67 % answered to have brought all
    available vaccination data to the study center, 54 % included all
    vaccinations ever received (random sample). Tetanus (18 %), influenza
    (17 %) and vaccinations received in childhood (13 %) were
    indicated most often as vaccinations not included in documentation.</p><p>The question regarding the attitude towards vaccinations was answered by 416/426
    (98 %) participants. The attitude towards vaccinations was assessed by
    74 % of responders as positive. Of those 18 % being critical,
    45 % indicated fear the side effects of vaccinations and 30 %
    were concerned that vaccinations might overwhelm the immune system. Among other
    reasons, responders took the chance to explain more in detail their critical
    attitude against specific vaccinations like influenza vaccination because of bad
    experiences. Only one person indicated to be in principle opposed to
    vaccinations; for 8 % of responders vaccinations were no issues of
    concern. No statistical difference of attitude towards vaccination could be
    detected between persons who submitted their vaccination certificate compared to
    those who did not submit any vaccination data.</p></sec><sec><title>Capturing and availability of vaccination data</title><p>Overall 372 vaccination certificates were electronically captured or copied the same day
    of examination, of which 7 % (27/372) of vaccination certificates were lost
    primarily because of missing identification numbers (ID) on the copy/scan. The procedure
    of blackening the personal data before capturing the vaccination data electronically was
    not followed consequently so that in about 17 % of documents this needed to be
    worked over subsequently. The quality of vaccination certificates was partly poor,
    especially the older ones (before 1990) often lacked the names of given vaccines
    (1700 vaccines), or the date of vaccination. In 5 % (222) of cases, the
    vaccination date was missing, (partly) illegible or cut off during the process of
    scanning/copying the vaccination data. Some of these data (121 dates) could be
    recorded as described above. Further problems encountered were the lack of information
    about vaccines as single or combined vaccination or the illegibility of documented
    vaccinations. The median time for data entry was 14.3 min per vaccination
    certificate (minimum of 0.4 min; maximum of 124.3 min). Including the
    data of physicians, vaccination data could be obtained for a total of 82 %
    (367/450) of participants or 79 % (367/466) of all eligible Pretest 2
    participants. An overview of submitted vaccination data per study center (number of
    valid vaccination documents and vaccinations) including the sample characteristics of
    persons submitting vaccination data is shown in Table <xref>1</xref>. The documented vaccinations covered a period from 1946 to
    2012.</p><p><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Submitted vaccination data and sample characteristics</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Hamburg</th><th>Hannover</th><th>Bremen</th><th>Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>No. of valid documents</td><td>158</td><td>155 (162<sup>a</sup>)</td><td>47</td><td>360 (367<sup>a</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td>No. of vaccinations</td><td>2402</td><td>1968 (2186<sup>b</sup>)</td><td>510</td><td>4880 (5098<sup>b</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td>No. of vaccinations/person</td><td>15.2</td><td>13.9</td><td>10.9</td><td>14.1</td></tr><tr><td>Mean (95 % CI)</td><td>(13.8–16.6)</td><td>(12.5–15.3)</td><td>(8.7–13.0)</td><td>(13.2–15.0)</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Sample characteristics</bold></td><td><bold>n</bold></td><td><bold>%</bold></td><td><bold>n</bold></td><td><bold>%</bold></td><td><bold>n</bold></td><td><bold>%</bold></td><td><bold>n</bold></td><td><bold>%</bold></td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>90</td><td>57.0</td><td>87</td><td>53.7</td><td>25</td><td>53.2</td><td>202</td><td>55.0</td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>68</td><td>43.0</td><td>75</td><td>46.3</td><td>22</td><td>46.8</td><td>165</td><td>45.0</td></tr><tr><td>20–29 years</td><td>23</td><td>14.6</td><td>18</td><td>11.1</td><td>3</td><td>6.4</td><td>44</td><td>12.0</td></tr><tr><td>30–39 years</td><td>15</td><td>9.5</td><td>17</td><td>10.5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>32</td><td>8.7</td></tr><tr><td>40–49 years</td><td>38</td><td>24.1</td><td>47</td><td>29.0</td><td>8</td><td>17.0</td><td>93</td><td>25.3</td></tr><tr><td>50–59 years</td><td>36</td><td>22.8</td><td>36</td><td>22.2</td><td>18</td><td>38.3</td><td>90</td><td>24.5</td></tr><tr><td>60–69 years</td><td>46</td><td>29.1</td><td>44</td><td>27.2</td><td>18</td><td>38.3</td><td>108</td><td>29.4</td></tr><tr><td>Born abroad</td><td>16</td><td>10.1</td><td>15</td><td>9.8</td><td>7</td><td>14.9</td><td>38</td><td>10.6</td></tr><tr><td>First language German</td><td>148</td><td>93.7</td><td>142</td><td>92.8</td><td>43</td><td>91.5</td><td>333</td><td>93.0</td></tr><tr><td>Married</td><td>59</td><td>37.3</td><td>88</td><td>57.5</td><td>23</td><td>48.9</td><td>170</td><td>47.5</td></tr><tr><td>Single</td><td>66</td><td>41.8</td><td>44</td><td>28.8</td><td>14</td><td>29.8</td><td>124</td><td>34.6</td></tr><tr><td>Full time employed</td><td>75</td><td>47.5</td><td>73</td><td>47.7</td><td>28</td><td>59.6</td><td>176</td><td>49.2</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly household net income (median):<break></break> 2250

    physicians’ documentation were available with a total of 630 documented
    vaccinations covering the period from 1956 to 2013. Most frequently documented
    vaccinations are shown in Table <xref>2</xref>. Single vaccinations against poliomyelitis and
    tetanus were significantly more often, influenza vaccinations significantly less often
    documented in vaccination certificates than at the physicians’ offices. To
    assess the quality of vaccination documentation, the data captured by vaccination
    certificates were compared to data provided by physicians. Using the example of tetanus,
    27 persons provided tetanus vaccination information documented in vaccination
    certificates (125 vaccinations) as well as documented by physicians
    (54 vaccinations). In all, 30 % (38/125) of tetanus vaccinations
    documented in the vaccination certificates corresponded exactly with tetanus
    vaccinations documented by physicians for 20/27 persons (74 %). In these cases
    the date of vaccination, the kind of vaccine and the producer of the vaccine were
    documented identically in each document. A total of 6 % (7/125) of documented
    tetanus vaccinations in the vaccination certificates did not correspond to documented
    tetanus vaccinations by physicians for 6/27 persons (22 %). Tetanus
    documentation differed because either the name of the vaccine was missing, not
    consistent or different producers of vaccines were indicated. In addition, 8/54
    (15 %) tetanus vaccinations documented by physicians were not documented in the
    vaccination certificates which accounts for at least 6 % (8/125) of tetanus
    vaccinations missing in the vaccination certificates.</p><p><table-wrap><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Frequency of vaccinations documented in vaccination certificates

    vaccination data from vaccination certificates</title><p>In Pretest 2, the ID-Screen questionnaire, a self-administered questionnaire
    about infectious diseases, was applied in Hamburg and Hannover (see Castell et al. in
    this issue). Three questions about influenza vaccination were included: whether an
    influenza vaccination has ever been received (V1), if yes, in which frequency (V2) and
    the year of the last influenza vaccination (V3). In total 365 persons answered
    the influenza questions. Vaccination documents were available for 78 % (284/365)
    of these participants, which allowed assessing the agreement of self-reported versus
    documented influenza vaccinations. Half of all responders (184/365) indicated having
    ever been vaccinated against the flu (Table <xref>4</xref>).
    Agreement with documentations was found for 84 (46 %) of these responders [Kappa
    0.48] with up to 20 influenza vaccinations per person. Vaccination was underreported in
    4 % (7/170) of cases where the receipt of influenza vaccination was negated but
    documented in the submitted vaccination records with up to 3 vaccinations per
    person. The “unvaccinated” responders were mostly vaccinated in
    2008–2010 (7/11 vaccinations). The self-reported year of last influenza
    vaccination was confirmed by vaccination records in 27 % of cases (41/150). In
    23 % (35/150) of cases the self-reported year did not correspond to the
    vaccination records because the year of the last remembered influenza vaccination was
    before (19 %) or after (5 %) the last influenza vaccination documented
