Participants</title><p>Two hundred and forty-three women with diagnosis of endometriosis were screened for acceptance into the study between 18 June and 6 November 2015. Of these, 199 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Forty-four subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment regimens. Forty-three women received treatment as allocated. Five women were removed from the PP analysis. One discontinued the study after signing the informed consent, one was removed from the study for intense abnormal uterine bleeding that stopped after medical intervention, and three were lost to follow-up ( <xref>Fig. 1</xref> ).</p><fig><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of study population randomized to two treatment groups.</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><p>For each group, 22 subjects were analyzed as ITT.

Primary Outcome: Pain Score</title><p>After 7 days of treatment, pain scores were significantly reduced in the resveratrol group, compared with the placebo group. After 42 days of treatment, however, no difference was observed in pain scores between treatment groups. The median difference between groups was 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): –1.6 to 2.3; <xref>Table 2</xref> ; ITT results; <italic>P</italic> = 0.7, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test]. Subgroup analysis was performed on subjects that followed protocol and did not use any medication for pain. Final pain scores were not significantly different between groups by PP analysis or by use or not of analgesics ( <xref>Table 2</xref> ).
