<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>The purpose of the present study was to compare the image quality of spinal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed on a high-field horizontal open versus a short-bore MR scanner in a randomized controlled study setup.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Altogether, 93 (80% women, mean age 53) consecutive patients underwent spine imaging after random assignement to a 1-T horizontal open MR scanner with a vertical magnetic field or a 1.5-T short-bore MR scanner. This patient subset was part of a larger cohort. Image quality was assessed by determining qualitative parameters, signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR), and quantitative contour sharpness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The image quality parameters were higher for short-bore MR imaging. Regarding all sequences, the relative differences were 39% for the mean overall qualitative image quality, 53% for the mean SNR values, and 34–37% for the quantitative contour sharpness (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). The CNR values were also higher for images obtained with the short-bore MR scanner. No sequence was of very poor (nondiagnostic) image quality.

Of these 106 patients, 93 underwent MR imaging, and all were included in this analysis (<xref>Figure 1</xref>). <xref>Table 1</xref> lists the baseline characteristics of the patients included. They were well matched between both groups. Eighty percent of the patients were women who have been shown to be more likely to suffer from claustrophobia <xref>[8]</xref>. The mean age was 53 (SD, 12; range, 27-88), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 29 (SD, 7.5; range, 17.5–52). All patients were at increased risk to suffer from claustrophobia. The mean CLQ score was 2,35 (SD, 0.69) which is in accordance with other high-risk groups <xref>[16]</xref>. Moreover, 50.5% of the 93 patients had prior MR imaging which was prevented, aborted or performed with sedation due to claustrophobia. Indications for MR imaging included: radicular pain (n = 60), (non-motor) neurologic symptoms and/or deficits (n = 60), motor deficits (n = 28), history of prior surgery (n = 10), cauda equina syndrome (n = 4), suspicion of cancer (n = 3), and history of previous trauma (n = 2). Some patients had more than one clinical indication for MR imaging. All indications were appropriate according to American College of Radiology guidelines <xref>[8]</xref>, <xref>[19]</xref>, <xref>[20]</xref>.</p><table-wrap><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0083427.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the 93 Randomized Patients who Underwent Spinal MR Imaging.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic></graphic><table><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><td></td><td>Short-Bore MR (n = 44)</td><td>Open MR (n = 49)</td><td><italic>P</italic> Value </td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Female sex</td><td>35 (79.5)</td><td>40 (81.6)</td><td>.8</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>53 (SD, 11.4)</td><td>53.1 (SD, 12.7)</td><td>.1</td></tr><tr><td>Age categories</td><td></td><td></td><td>.7</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;30</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>30 - &lt;50</td><td>22 (50)</td><td>23 (46.9)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>50 - &lt;70</td><td>16 (36.4)</td><td>20 (40.8)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>≥70</td><td>6 (13.6)</td><td>5 (10.2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Body height in cm</td><td>167.9 (SD, 8.6)</td><td>168.3 (SD, 10.3)</td><td>.8</td></tr><tr><td>Body weight in kg</td><td>79.6 (SD, 23.3)</td><td>84.9 (SD, 25.9)</td><td>.3</td></tr><tr><td>Body mass index (BMI)</td><td>28.1 (SD, 7.7)</td><td>29.7 (SD, 7.3)</td><td>.3</td></tr><tr><td>BMI categories</td><td></td><td></td><td>.5</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;20</td><td>4 (9.1)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>20- &lt;3</td><td>(54.5)</td><td>28 (57.1)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>30- &lt;40</td><td>12 (27.3)</td><td>15 (30.6)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>≥40</td><td>4 (9.1)</td><td>5 (10.2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Maximum body circumference in cm</td><td>112.8 (SD, 17.3)</td><td>115.6 (SD, 14.4)</td><td>.4</td></tr><tr><td>Region of MR imaging</td><td></td><td></td><td>.9</td></tr><tr><td>Cervicothoracic spine</td><td>14 (31.8)</td><td>15 (30.6)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Thoracolumbar spine</td><td>26 (59.1)</td><td>28 (57.1)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Whole spine</td><td>4 (9.1)</td><td>6 (12.2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Claustrophobia Questionnaire mean value<xref>a</xref></td><td>2.38 (SD, 0.75)</td><td>2.32 (SD, 0.65)</td><td>.7</td></tr><tr><td>State anxiety before MR imaging<xref>b</xref></td><td>2.65 (SD, 0.56)</td><td>2.65 (SD, 0.68)</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn><label></label><p>Data are number (%) or arithmetic mean (SD).
