<abstract><sec><title>OBJECTIVE</title><p>After intensive insulin treatment, many obese African American patients with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hyperglycemia are able to achieve near-normoglycemia remission. The optimal treatment to prevent hyperglycemic relapses after remission is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, 4-year, placebo-controlled study randomly assigned 48 African American subjects with DKA and severe hyperglycemia to metformin 1,000 mg daily (<italic>n</italic> = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg daily (<italic>n</italic> = 16), or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 15) after normoglycemia remission. Hyperglycemic relapse was defined as fasting glucose &gt;130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &gt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at randomization and at 3 months and then every 6 months for a median of 331 days. Oral minimal model and incremental area under the curve for insulin (AUCi) were used to calculate insulin sensitivity (Si) and β-cell function, respectively. Disposition index (DI) was calculated as a product of Si and incremental AUCi.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Relapse-free survival was higher in sitagliptin and metformin (<italic>P</italic> = 0.015) compared with placebo, and mean time to relapse was significantly prolonged in the metformin and sitagliptin groups compared with the placebo group (480 vs. 305 days, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004). The probability of relapse was significantly lower for metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10–0.81]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10–0.98]) than for placebo. Subjects who remained in remission had a higher DI (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) than those with hyperglycemia relapse without significant changes in Si.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study shows that near-normoglycemia remission was similarly prolonged by treatment with sitagliptin and metformin. The prolongation of remission was due to improvement in β-cell function.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>Forty-eight African American subjects with DKA (<italic>n</italic> = 22) and severe hyperglycemia (<italic>n</italic> = 26) were included in the study. Seventeen subjects were randomly assigned to metformin 1,000 mg daily, 16 to sitagliptin 100 mg daily, and 15 to placebo. Four subjects in the metformin group, 6 in the sitagliptin group, and 1 in the placebo group were lost to follow-up. One subject in the sitagliptin group and one subject in the placebo group withdrew from the study. The overall median follow-up after insulin discontinuation was 331 days (interquartile range 102, 612 days) with no differences between randomized groups (<xref>Table 1</xref>). The subjects lost to follow-up or who withdrew from the study were in near-normoglycemia remission during their last documented study visit. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics at presentation between subjects who withdrew and those who stayed in the study, except for HbA<sub>1c</sub>. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was lower at presentation of DKA/hyperglycemia in subjects who withdrew compared with those who stayed (12.0 ± 2.3% [107 ± 25 mmol/mol] vs. 13.5 ± 2.0% [124 ± 22 mmol/mol],

Deliberate restriction of food intake (dieting) produces short-term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long-term weight management.

Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics. Use of an online self-monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database. Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention.

Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments, most women rated “Mind, Body, Food” as useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%) and liked the intervention (22/25, 88%). From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score <italic>P</italic>&lt;.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: <italic>P</italic> ≤.01), psychological flexibility (<italic>P</italic>=.01), and general mental health (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (<italic>P</italic>=.01).

A programming delay prevented monitoring from the start of the study, which explains missing usage data for three women. Of the 37 participants for whom usage data were available, 12 (32%) completed all 12 modules, 11 (30%) completed 7 to 11 modules, 12 (32%) completed 1 to 6 modules, and two women (5%) completed no modules. The median number of modules completed was 7.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-12) modules. The median number of sessions during the monitored period was 7 (a minimum of 1 session to a maximum of 66 sessions). The median session duration during the monitored period was 12 minutes, 54 seconds (a minimum of 3 minutes, 58 seconds, to a maximum of 100 minutes, 8 seconds). The median number of EAT entries over the 14-week intervention was 7 (a minimum of 1 entry to a maximum of 314 entries). The median number of weeks that participants recorded eating experiences in the EAT was 3 (IQR 1-9) weeks. Of the 40 participants enrolled in the study, 4 women (10%) used the EAT for at least 12 weeks of their intervention period, 7 (18%) used the EAT for 7 to 11 weeks, 20 (50%) used the EAT for 1 to 6 weeks, and 9 (23%) did not use the EAT during their intervention period.</p><p>Eleven women had limited access to “Mind, Body, Food” for more than 5 days, predominantly due to being away from home (n=8) or technical issues (n=3). Technical issues that prevented module completion included attempting to access “Mind, Body, Food” from an incompatible browser (n=3), using incorrect login details (n=1), and other issues not described (n=1).

in Eating Behavior</title><p>The study was not designed to detect the effects of the intervention on the outcome measures (no control group was included), but within-group comparisons were performed as part of the feasibility component of the pilot study. From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant increases in IES-2 total scores and all four IES-2 subscale scores (<xref>Table 4</xref>). There was no evidence that these improvements diminished at the 3-month follow-up. Based on use of the dichotomous variable (ie, binge eating vs no binge eating), 7 out of 14 women who reported eating a significantly large amount of food (ie, binge eating) at the preintervention assessment reported no binge eating at the postintervention assessment. There were no women who transitioned from no binge eating at the preintervention assessment to binge eating at the postintervention assessment or at the 3-month follow-up; 4 women who reported binge eating at postintervention no longer reported binge eating at the 3-month follow-up. McNemar’s test revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of women binge eating from the pre- to postintervention visits (<italic>P</italic>=.01) and a significant decrease from postintervention to follow-up (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.001). The median days women who were categorized as binge eaters reported binge eating at preintervention was 4.25 (IQR 2.5-10) days, at postintervention was 4 (IQR 2-8) days, and at the 3-month follow-up it was 2 (IQR 2-4) days. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to examine changes in the reported number of days women were unable to prevent or stop episodes of eating an unusually large amount of food and revealed a significant decrease from pre- to postintervention (<italic>P</italic>=.03) and no evidence of a change from postintervention to follow-up (<italic>P</italic>=.57).</p></sec><sec><title>Psychological Inflexibility, Quality of Life, and BMI</title><p>Psychological inflexibility decreased significantly from pre- to postintervention (mean change −4.23 [SD 7.13], <italic>P</italic>=.006), and there was a tendency for a further decrease in psychological inflexibility from postintervention to 3-month-follow-up (mean change −2.60 [SD 6.58], <italic>P</italic>=.06) (<xref>Table 4</xref>). There were no significant changes in general physical health from pre- to postintervention (pre- to postintervention PCS scores: mean change 0.29 [SD 9.35], <italic>P</italic>=.88; postintervention to 3-month follow-up PCS scores: mean change 1.26 [SD 10.46], <italic>P</italic>=.55).

There were no statistically significant changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention or postintervention to 3-month follow-up (mean change −0.13 [SD 0.88], <italic>P</italic>=.46 and mean change −0.01 [SD 0.57], <italic>P</italic>=.93, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Associations Between Changes in Intuitive Eating With BMI and Psychological Inflexibility</title><p>Spearman correlations showed a statistically significant inverse relationship between pre- to postintervention change in total intuitive eating scores and pre- to postintervention change in BMI (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub>=−.43, <italic>P</italic>=.03). Thus, greater decreases in BMI were associated with greater increases in intuitive eating. However, when relationships with individual subscales were examined, a significant association was found for only one subscale: greater decreases in BMI were associated with greater increases in eating for physical rather than emotional reasons (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub>=−.56, <italic>P</italic>=.003). There was also a statistically significant inverse relationship between change in psychological inflexibility scores and change in intuitive eating scores (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub>=−.52, <italic>P</italic>=.006); that is, greater improvements in psychological flexibility were associated with greater increases in total intuitive eating scores. Furthermore, larger improvements in psychological flexibility were associated with greater increases in two subscale scores: eating for physical rather than emotional reasons (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub>=−.41, <italic>P</italic>=.04) and reliance on hunger and satiety cues (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub>=−.62, <italic>P</italic>&lt;.001).
