<abstract><p>In order to assess the effects of juice feedings during acute diarrhea a double-blind, randomized study was performed in 90 children, mean age of 10 ± 4.28 months. Thirty patients with acute diarrhea were fed twice-daily 15 ml/kg of Apple Juice (AJ), 30 received White Grape Juice (WGJ), and 30 were given colored and flavored water (WA) as part of their age appropriate dietary intake. The duration and severity of diarrhea were the main endpoint variables of the study performed in a metabolic unit. The patients were similar among the 3 groups, had diarrhea for 50–64 hours prior to admission, and were dehydrated when admitted to the unit for study. Half of the patients in each group were well nourished and the others had mild to moderate degrees of malnutrition. Rotavirus infection was the agent causing the illness in 63% of the patients. The infants fed juice ingested 14–17% more calories than those given WA, (those receiving AJ and WGJ ingested 95 and 98 Calories/Kg/d respectively) whereas those receiving WA consumed 81 cal/kg/d). The increased energy intake was not at the expense of other foods or milk formula. The mean body weight gain was greater among patients receiving WGJ (+ 50.7 gm) as compared with the patients in the AJ group (+ 18.3 gm) or the patients fed WA (- 0.7 gm) (p = 0.08). The duration of the illness was longer in the infants fed juice as compared with those given WA (p = 0.006), the mean +/- SD duration in hours was 49.4 ± 32.6, 47.5 ± 38.9 and 26.5 ± 27.4 in patients fed AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. All patients improved while ingesting juice and none of them developed persistent diarrhea; most recovered within 50 hours of the beginning of treatment and less than one fourth had diarrhea longer than 96 hours in the unit. The fecal losses were also increased among the juice fed patients (p = 0.001); the mean ± SD fecal excretion in g/kg/h was 3.94 ± 2.35, 3.59 ± 2.35, and 2.19 ± 1.63 in AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. The stool output was highest during the first day of treatment among all the patients, though those fed AJ had the highest volume of fecal losses and those who received WA had the lowest stool excretion. After the first day of treatment the differences in fecal excretion were not significant. The ability to tolerate carbohydrates during the illness and immediately after recovery was similar among the 3 groups of patients. Intake of juices with different fructose/glucose ratios and osmolarities resulted in more fecal losses and more prolonged diarrhea as compared with water feedings, but the patients given juice ingested more calories and gained more weight, particularly among those being fed the juice with equimolar concentrations of fructose and glucose.</p></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>The clinical characteristics and the laboratory data of the patients on admission are shown in tables <xref>2</xref> and <xref>3</xref>. The patients in each of the 3 groups were similar in age, duration and severity of diarrhea, presence of fever and vomiting. Also there were no differences in the proportion of patients who received breast feedings or in their nutritional status. Over 46% of patients studied in each group, were well nourished, more than 33% showed mild body weight deficits (&lt;1 SD) and the others had mild to moderate malnutrition (&gt;2 SD). All patients presented some dehydration (mild to moderate), and required no intravenous hydration therapy. Differences in clinical characteristics were not significant among groups.</p><table-wrap><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Clinical Characteristics of Patients on Admission</p></caption><table><thead><tr><td></td><td>Apple Juice n = 30</td><td>White Grape Juice n = 30</td><td>Water* n= 30</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><hr/></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>χ</td><td><italic>SD</italic></td><td>χ</td><td><italic>SD</italic></td><td>χ</td><td>SD</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age (months)</td><td>10.27</td><td>4.75</td><td>10.27</td><td>4.14</td><td>11.09</td><td>4.00</td></tr><tr><td>Diarrhea Duration (hr)</td><td>56.37</td><td>33.90</td><td>64.17</td><td>38.95</td><td>53.47</td><td>33.35</td></tr><tr><td>Fever Duration (hr)</td><td>37.77</td><td>33.46</td><td>47.11</td><td>49.62</td><td>41.04</td><td>38.11</td></tr><tr><td>Vomiting (h)</td><td>41.57</td><td>35.45</td><td>46.97</td><td>39.54</td><td>44.33</td><td>31.44</td></tr><tr><td>Breastfeeding</td><td>13 (n)</td><td>43.3%</td><td>16 (n)</td><td>53.3%</td><td>09 (n)</td><td>30.0 %</td></tr><tr><td>Well Nourished</td><td>16 (n)</td><td>53.3%</td><td>15 (n)</td><td>50.0%</td><td>14 (n)</td><td>46.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Nutritional Risk**</td><td>08(n)</td><td>26.6%</td><td>10(n)</td><td>33.3%</td><td>15(n)</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Mild Malnutrition</td><td>03 (n)</td><td>10.0%</td><td>05(n)</td><td>16.6%</td><td>01(n)</td><td>3.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate/Severe Malnutrition</td><td>03(n)</td><td>10.0%</td><td>00(n)</td><td>0.0%</td><td>00(n)</td><td>0.0%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>There were no statistically significant differences among groups, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) p &gt; 0.05.
