<abstract><sec id="st1"><title>Objectives:</title><p>To compare the combination of paracetamol (20 mg/kg) and propofol to fentanyl (1 &#x000b5;g/kg) and propofol in terms of providing adequate analgesia and a comparable recovery profile in suction termination procedures.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This is a prospective, randomized clinical study in which we obtained informed consents from 146 women (fentanyl group: 76 [52.1%], paracetamol group: 70 [47.9%]) who were scheduled for suction curettage at the Istanbul Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Education and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey in January 2015. Patients were randomly allocated into a fentanyl group or a paracetamol group. Visual analogue scores, modified Aldrete scores, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded during and after the surgical procedure. A record was also maintained of any adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>When the modified Aldrete scores at 60 minutes, systolic pressures at 0 minutes, oxygen saturation at 10, 15, 20 minutes, diastolic blood pressure at 10, 15, 20 minutes, heart rates, and visual analogue scores were compared, there was no significant difference between groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). In the fentanyl group, systolic blood pressures at 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes and diastolic blood pressure at 5 minutes and oxygen saturation at 5 minutes were significantly lower (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that the analgesic properties and recovery profiles of intravenous paracetamol is as effective as fentanyl when used in suction termination procedures. Further larger studies are still required.</p></sec></abstract><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>There were 146 patients involved in this study. When the demographic data, ASA and operation values of the 146 patients were compared (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref></bold>), no significant differences were determined between groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref></bold>).

There was no significant difference in the HR between groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref></bold>). In the fentanyl group, systolic blood pressures at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes were significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) than in the paracetamol group; however, there was no difference between groups at 0 minutes (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref></bold>). Diastolic blood pressures at 5 minutes were significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in the fentanyl group; however, there were no differences between groups at 10, 15 and 20 minutes (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref></bold>). In the fentanyl group, SpO<sub>2</sub> at 5 minutes was significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) than in the paracetamol group, but there were no differences between groups at 10, 15, and 20 minutes (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref></bold>).
