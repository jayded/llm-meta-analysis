<abstract><sec id="st1"><title>Background:</title><p>Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been used to provide intra- and post-operative analgesia with single incision laparoscopic (SIL) bariatric and gynecological surgery with mixed results. Its efficacy in providing analgesia for SIL cholecystectomy (SILC) via the same approach remains unexplored.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims:</title><p>The primary objective of our study was to compare the efficacy of bilateral TAP block with local anesthetic infiltration for perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing SILC.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Settings and Design:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial performed in a tertiary care hospital.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Forty-two patients undergoing SILC were randomized to receive either ultrasound-guided (USG) bilateral mid-axillary TAP blocks with 0.375% ropivacaine or local anesthetic infiltration of the port site. The primary outcome measure was the requirement of morphine in the first 24 h postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Statistical Analysis:</title><p>The data were analyzed using <italic>t</italic>-test, Mann&#x02013;Whitney test or Chi-square test.</p></sec><sec id="st6"><title>Results:</title><p>The 24 h morphine requirement (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) was 34.57 &#x000b1; 14.64 mg in TAP group and 32.76 &#x000b1; 14.34 mg in local infiltration group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.688). The number of patients requiring intraoperative supplemental fentanyl in TAP group was 8 and in local infiltration group was 16 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.028). The visual analog scale scores at rest and on coughing were significantly higher in the local infiltration group in the immediate postoperative period (<italic>P</italic> = 0.034 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.007, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="st7"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>USG bilateral TAP blocks were not effective in decreasing 24 h morphine requirement as compared to local anesthetic infiltration in patients undergoing SILC although it provided some analgesic benefit intraoperatively and in the initial 4 h postoperatively. Hence, the benefits of TAP blocks are not worth the effort and time spent for administering them for this surgery.</p></sec></abstract><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Flow of patients is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Flow of patients in the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-561-g002" /></fig><p>The demographic parameters were similar among the two study groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data of patients in the two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-561-g003" /></table-wrap><p>The number of patients requiring intraoperative supplemental fentanyl in the TAP group was 8 and in the control group was 16 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.028*). The supplemental dosing of fentanyl (median [minimum&#x02013;maximum]) in the TAP group was 0 &#x000b5;g (0&#x02013;120) and in the control group was 30 &#x000b5;g (0&#x02013;120) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013*).

Proportion of patients having moderate to severe pain was not significantly different at other time points.
