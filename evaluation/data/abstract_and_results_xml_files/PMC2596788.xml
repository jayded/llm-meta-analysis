<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Patient education has proved beneficial in several but not all chronic disease. Inconsistent findings may rely on varying educational effects of various programs and differential effects on subgroups of patients. Patients' increase in disease knowledge may serve as a feedback to the educator on how well the education program works – but may not be associated to relevant clinical outcomes like quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to investigate the effects of a group based education program for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) on disease knowledge and the association between knowledge and QoL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with GERD were randomly allocated to education (102 patients) or control (109 patients). The education program was designed as a structured dialogue conveying information about pathophysiology, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of GERD, patients' rights and use of healthcare. Outcomes were a 24 item knowledge test on GERD (score 0 – 24) 2 and 12 months after the educational program and disease specific and general QoL (Digestive symptoms and disease impact, DSIQ, and General Health Questionnaire, GHQ).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients allocated to education achieved higher knowledge test scores than controls at 2 months (17.0 vs. 13.1, p &lt; 0.001) and at 12 months (17.1 vs. 14.0, p &lt; 0.001) follow-up. Knowledge test score was positively associated with having completed advanced school and inversely related to psychiatric illness and poor QoL as perceived by the patients at the time of inclusion. Overall, changes in knowledge test score were not associated with change in QoL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A group based education program for patients with GERD designed as a structured dialogue increased patients' disease knowledge, which was retained after 1 year. Changes in GERD-knowledge were not associated with change in QoL.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT0061850</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Of 211 patients who were included, 102 were randomly allocated to GERD education and 109 to control. The GERD -education and control groups did not differ statistically with regards to socio-demographic variables; disease history or disease characteristics (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> ). Of the patients who were allocated to GERD -education, 58 (56.9%) attended three lessons, 27 (26.5%) two and 5 (4.9%) one lesson. Twelve patients (11.8%) did not meet at all, of whom 5 were not able due to work or private obligations, 4 gave no reasons, 2 on grounds of other diseases and 1 did not wish to participate. At two months follow-up 90 patients (88%) in the GERD -education group and 100 patients (92%) in the control group responded completely. At 12 months 85 (83%) and 88 patients (81%) gave complete responses respectively.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Socio-demographic and disease characteristics of patients allocated to GERD-education vs. control groups, recorded at baseline.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td/><td align="center"><bold>Education (n = 102)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Control (n = 109)</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Age, years</td><td align="center">47 (12)</td><td align="center">47 (14)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sex (female)</td><td align="center">49%</td><td align="center">50%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Primary school only</td><td align="center">31%</td><td align="center">34%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cohabitating</td><td align="center">77%</td><td align="center">80%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Blue-collar worker</td><td align="center">22%</td><td align="center">22%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">BMI (kg/m <sup>2</sup> )</td><td align="center">26 (3.6)</td><td align="center">26 (4.7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Previous history of serious disease</td><td align="center">14%</td><td align="center">17%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Length of GERD history (months)</td><td align="center">166 (151)</td><td align="center">169 (154)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Esophagitis</td><td align="center">60%</td><td align="center">51%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Having used H2-blocker or PPI</td><td align="center">72%</td><td align="center">63%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ranitidine responder</td><td align="center">41% (n = 74)</td><td align="center">47% (n = 71)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Somatic comorbidity</td><td align="center">53%</td><td align="center">54%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Psychiatric comorbidity</td><td align="center">8%</td><td align="center">10%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Continuous variables are means (SD), categorical variables are percentages.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>GERD-knowledge test</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows mean GERD-knowledge at 2 and 12 months.

An association was found between an increase in GERD-knowledge and deterioration in sense of coping (GHQ-30 profile: Coping failure) for patients who had completed advanced school (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> ). For patients with primary school only, associations in the same direction were found in the DSIQ scales Gastric dysfunction, Life impairment and sum score, and an increase in GERD-knowledge test score.
