<abstract><title>Abstract</title><sec sec-type="background"><title>Background:</title><p>In some studies, gum-chewing was demonstrated to have a beneficial effect on resumption of bowel function; however, other contradictory findings in other studies refute the effects of gum-chewing on peristaltic movements and digestive system stimulation. In addition, most previous studies were after colorectal or gynecology surgery, whereas few reports focused on the effect of gum-chewing after gastrectomy. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of gum-chewing on postoperative bowel function in patients who had undergone laparoscopic gastrectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p>From March 2014 to March 2016, 75 patients with gastric cancer received elective laparoscopic surgery in Shanghai Tongji hospital and were postoperatively randomly divided into 2 groups: 38 in a gum-chewing (Gum) group and 37 in a control (No gum) group. The patients in the Gum group chewed sugarless gum 3 times daily, each time for at least 15 minutes, until the day of postoperative exhaust defecation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean time to first flatus (83.4&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;35.6 vs. 79.2&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;24.2 hours; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.554) and the mean time to first defecation (125.7&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;41.2 vs. 115.4&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;34.2 hours; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.192) were no different between the no gum and Gum groups.

After 10 patients were excluded before randomization (see flowchart), a total of 75 patients were randomly assigned to either the Gum (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;38) or No gum (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37) group.</p><p>Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). There were no differences in sex, age, comorbidities, and ASA grade. Twenty-one patients in the No gum group had comorbidities before their operations, as did 21 patients in the Gum group. The most common comorbidities included primary hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, post-stroke syndrome, and coronary artery disease.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6501-g002" /></table-wrap><p>The operation outcomes for both groups are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Two cases in the No gum group and 4 cases in the Gum group were converted to open surgery. There was no significant difference in the duration of operation between the 2 groups. The rates of POI of the 2 groups did not significantly differ. In the No gum group, 1 patient developed CD grade I complications: wound infection requiring dressing change. Grade II complications occurred in 2 patients: pneumonia requiring antibiotics. One patient developed a grade III complication: pleural effusion and atelectasis requiring thoracocentesis under local anesthesia. In the Gum group, 1 patient developed CD grade I complications: wound infection requiring dressing change. Grade II complications occurred in 4 patients: 2 developed pneumonia requiring antibiotics, 1 developed liver abscess requiring antibiotics, and 1 developed congestive heart failure requiring cardiac glycosides and diuretics. Two patients developed a grade III complication: pleural effusion and atelectasis requiring thoracocentesis under local anesthesia. There was no perioperative mortality in this series.</p><p>Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with fentanyl was administered to all the patients.
