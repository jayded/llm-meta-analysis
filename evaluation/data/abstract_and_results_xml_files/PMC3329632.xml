<abstract><sec><title>Background/aims</title><p>To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab as either monotherapy or combined with laser therapy, compared with laser monotherapy, in the treatment of diabetic macular oedema (DME) causing visual impairment from a UK healthcare payer perspective.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A Markov model simulated long-term outcomes and costs of treating DME in one eye (BCVA &#x02264;75 letters) based on data from the RESTORE Phase III trial. Outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were simulated for a 15-year time horizon based on 12-month follow-up from RESTORE and published long-term data. Costs included treatment, disease monitoring, visual impairment and blindness (at 2010 price levels).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ranibizumab monotherapy resulted in a 0.17 QALY gain at an incremental cost of &#x000a3;4191 relative to laser monotherapy, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of &#x000a3;24&#x02008;028. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a 64% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of &#x000a3;30&#x02008;000 per QALY. Combined ranibizumab and laser therapy resulted in a 0.13 QALY gain at an incremental cost of &#x000a3;4695 relative to laser monotherapy (ICER &#x000a3;36&#x02008;106; 42% probability of ICER &#x0003c;&#x000a3;30&#x02008;000).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on RESTORE 1-year follow-up data, ranibizumab monotherapy appears to be cost-effective relative to laser monotherapy, the current standard of care. Cost-effectiveness of combination therapy is less certain. Ongoing studies will further inform on disease progression and the need for additional ranibizumab treatment.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>The model predicted that after 1&#x02005;year, a greater proportion of patients treated with ranibizumab monotherapy or combination therapy would have BCVA &#x0003e;65 letters (Snellen score &#x0003e;6/18) compared with patients treated with laser monotherapy (48% and 47%, respectively, versus 38% in the laser arm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">figure 2</xref>). After 15&#x02005;years, the proportion with severe visual impairment in the treated eye (BCVA &#x0003c;35 letters, Snellen &#x0003c;6/60) was predicted to be 12% and 13% in the ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy groups, respectively, versus 19% in the laser group.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Modelled distribution by health states after (A) 1 and (B) 15&#x02005;years.

Combination therapy provided an incremental gain of 0.13 QALY over laser monotherapy for an incremental cost of &#x000a3;4 695, leading to an ICER of &#x000a3;36&#x02008;106 per QALY gained.</p><p>Univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the model was stable and that ICERs were most sensitive to changes in the number of injections and time horizon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">table 3</xref>). Using utilities elicited by Lloyd <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and Brown <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> in patients with diabetic retinopathy led to greater QALY gains and lower ICERs for ranibizumab monotherapy or combination therapy relative to laser monotherapy. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the model's robustness (Supplementary figure 1). Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of &#x000a3;30&#x02008;000 per QALY gained, the probability that ranibizumab monotherapy would be cost-effective relative to laser monotherapy was estimated to be 64% (Supplementary figure 2); the corresponding probability for combination therapy relative to laser monotherapy was 42%. </p></sec>
