<abstract><sec><title>Background and purpose</title><p> The trabecular metal tibial monoblock component (TM) is a relatively new option available for total knee arthroplasty. We have previously reported a large degree of early migration of the trabecular metal component in a subset of patients. These implants all appeared to stabilize at 2 years. We now present 5-year RSA results of the TM and compare them with those of the NexGen Option Stemmed cemented tibial component (Zimmer, Warsaw IN).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p> 70 patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to receive either the TM implant or the cemented component. RSA examination was done postoperatively and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years. RSA outcomes were translations, rotations, and maximum total point motion (MTPM) of the components. MTPM values were used to classify implants as &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;stable&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> At the 5-year follow-up, 45 patients were available for analysis. There were 27 in the TM group and 18 in the cemented group. MTPM values were similar in the 2 groups (p = 0.9). The TM components had significantly greater subsidence than the cemented components (p = 0.001). The proportion of &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d; components at 5 years was 2 of 18 in the cemented group and 0 of 27 in the TM group (p = 0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p> In the previous 2-year report, we expressed our uncertainty concerning the long-term stability of the TM implant due to the high initial migration seen in some cases. Here, we report stability of this implant up to 5 years in all cases. The implant appears to achieve solid fixation despite high levels of migration initially.</p></sec></abstract><sec id="ss5"><title>Results</title><sec id="ss6"><title>Standard outcomes and follow-up</title><p>All standard outcome measures for the 45 patients in this study are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

However, retrospectively, this implant had somewhat anomalous 2-year data (0.64 mm, 0.45 mm, and 0.87 mm at 1, 2, and 5 years), where the difference between 1 year and 5 years would make the implant appear stable (0.23 mm in 4 years) but the difference between 2 years and 5 years would make the implant appear to be continuously migrating (0.42 mm in 3 years). The condition number and mean errors for this subject were within normal limits.
