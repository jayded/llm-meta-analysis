<abstract><title>Background</title><p>The safety of the immune complexes composed of yeast-derived hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies (abbreviated as YIC) among healthy adults and chronic hepatitis B patients has been proved in phase I and phase IIa trial. A larger number of patients for study of dosage and efficacy are therefore needed.</p><sec><title>Methods and Principal Findings</title><p>Two hundred forty two HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients were immunized with six injections of either 30 µg YIC, 60 µg of YIC or alum adjuvant as placebo at four-week intervals under code. HBV markers and HBV DNA were monitored during immunization and 24 weeks after the completion of immunization. The primary endpoint was defined as loss of HBeAg, or presence of anti-HBe antibody or suppression of HBV DNA, while the secondary endpoint was both HBeAg seroconversion and suppression of HBV DNA. Statistical significance was not reached in primary endpoints four weeks after the end of treatment among three groups, however, at the end of follow-up, HBeAg sero-conversion rate was 21.8%(17/78) and 9% (7/78) in the 60 µg YIC and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.03), with 95% confidence intervals at 1.5% to 24.1%. Using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) model, a significant difference of group effects was found between 60 µg YIC and the placebo groups in terms of the primary endpoint. Eleven serious adverse events occurred, which were 5.1%, 3.6%, and 5.0% in the placebo, 30 µg YIC and 60 µg YIC groups respectively (p&gt;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Though statistical differences in the preset primary and secondary endpoints among the three groups were not reached, a late and promising HBeAg seroconversion effect was shown in the 60 µg YIC immunized regimen. By increasing the number of patients and injections, the therapeutic efficacy of YIC in chronic hepatitis B patients will be further evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ChiCTR.org <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/Site/TaskView.aspx?ID=b896852e-11ff-4393-90e4-d2bd2db8b481">ChiCTR-TRC-00000022</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients</title><p>Three hundred and fifty four hepatitis B patients were evaluated for the inclusion criteria.

Ten of these were males, while one was female. The age of patients with SAE varied between 21 and 41years of age. Four occurred after the first injection (2 in placebo group, 2 in 60 µg YIC group), two occurred after the second injection (1 in placebo group, 1 in 30 µg YIC group), one occurred after 5 injections (in 30 µg YIC group), and the other four appeared after 6 injections (1 in placebo group, 1 in 30 µg YIC group and 2 in 60 µg YIC group). All 11 patients were hospitalized and recovered after treatment without immunomodulating drugs (one patient used antiviral treatment). No deaths were observed during the study period.</p></sec></sec>
