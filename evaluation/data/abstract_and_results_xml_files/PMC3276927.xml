<abstract><sec id="st1"><title>Background:</title><p>Hernia is an abnormal protrusion of an organ or tissue through a defect in its surrounding walls which most commonly involves the abdominal wall, particularly the inguinal region. The treatment options for hernia ranges from simple exercises to modern surgeries. The effect of yoga therapy is not scientifically examined for reversible inguinal hernia and hence this study is undertaken with the aim to test the effect of selected asanas in reversible inguinal hernia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A quasi experimental trail of 19 males through consecutive sampling was done with selected asanas for three months and the outcome was measured by a questionnaire focusing on pain, aggravating factors, relieving factors and frequency of occurrence of symptoms of hernia.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The pre and post interventional data were compared statistically and found significant reduction of symptoms with <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.001 in pain, frequency of occurrence and aggravating factors.
