<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Negative attentional biases are thought to increase the risk of recurrence in  depression, suggesting that reduction of such biases may be a plausible  strategy in the secondary prevention of the illness. However, no previous  study has tested whether reducing negative attentional bias causally affects  risk factors for depressive recurrence. The current experimental medicine  study reports the effects of a computerized attentional bias modification  (ABM) procedure on intermediate measures of the risk of depressive  recurrence (residual depressive symptoms and the cortisol awakening  response) in patients with recurrent depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty-one patients with at least two previous episodes of depression who were  currently in remission were randomized to receive either an active  (positive) or placebo computer-based ABM regime. The ABM regime presented  either pictures of faces or words. Residual depressive symptoms, measured  using the Beck Depression Inventory and the cortisol awakening response were  measured immediately before and after completion of the bias modification  and then again after 4 weeks' follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Positive, face-based ABM reduced both measures of recurrence risk (Beck  Depression Inventory and cortisol awakening response). This effect occurred  during the month following completion of bias modification. Word-based  modification did not influence the outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Positive face-based ABM was able to reduce intermediate measures of  recurrence risk in previously depressed patients. These results suggest that  ABM may provide a &#x0201c;cognitive vaccine&#x0201d; against depression and  offer a useful strategy in the secondary prevention of the illness.</p></sec></abstract><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Group Demographics, Baseline Measures, and Compliance</title><p>As can be seen from <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the groups were  well matched on baseline demographics, IQ, and measures of illness severity.

There was no general ABM type &#x000d7; time effect [<italic>F</italic>(2,112)  = 1.1, <italic>p</italic> = .35]. As can be seen from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure  2</xref> positive, face-based ABM lead to a reduction of symptoms compared with placebo  ABM [<xref rid="fig2"  ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A; <italic>F</italic>(2,56) = 3.7, <italic>p</italic>  = .03], whereas word based ABM had no significant effect [<xref rid="fig2"  ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B; <italic>F</italic>(2,56) &#x0003c; 1, <italic>  p</italic> = .4]. Interestingly, the beneficial effect of positive face ABM  displayed a time lag; symptoms did not change across the 2 weeks of ABM [<italic>  F</italic>(1,28) &#x0003c; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .5]; rather, they reduced during  the follow-up period [<italic>F</italic>(1,28) = 5.9, <italic>p</italic> = .02] with  this change resulting from a significant drop in symptoms reported by the positive face  ABM group [<italic>t</italic>(15) = 2.4, <italic>p</italic> = .03] and no significant  change seen in the placebo face ABM group [<italic>t</italic>(13) &#x0003c; 1, <italic>p</italic>  = .4].</p><p>Observer reported depressive symptoms, measured using the HRSD, revealed an identical ABM  type &#x000d7; ABM stimuli &#x000d7; time interaction [<xref  rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref rid="fig2"  ref-type="fig">2</xref>D; <italic>F</italic>(2,112) = 3.4, <italic>p</italic> =  .04]; however, in this case, the post hoc tests of the interaction for face training was  significant only at a trend level [<italic>F</italic>(1,28) = 2.9, <italic>  p</italic> = .09].</p><p>Symptoms of anxiety, measured using the trait subscale of the STAI displayed the same  specific effect of positive face ABM as that seen for the BDI [<xref  rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>E, F; <italic>F</italic>(2,112) = 3.3, <italic>  p</italic> = .05] with the beneficial effect again occurring during follow-up [<italic>  F</italic>(1,28) = 5.2, <italic>p</italic> = .03] and being driven by a significant  reduction of anxious symptoms in the positive face ABM group [<italic>t</italic>(15) =  2.4, <italic>p</italic> = .03].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>The Effect of ABM on the CAR</title><p>Analysis of the CAR response revealed a significant ABM type &#x000d7; ABM stimuli  interaction [<italic>F</italic>(1,53) = 4.3, <italic>p</italic> = .04], which was  present across the three time points [ABM type &#x000d7; ABM stimuli &#x000d7; time; <italic>  F</italic>(2,106)&#x0003c;1, <italic>p</italic> = .4]. In keeping with the effects on  residual symptoms, face-based ABM influenced the CAR [<xref rid="fig3"  ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A; <italic>F</italic>(2,54) = 4, <italic>p</italic> =  .02], whereas word-based ABM did not [<xref rid="fig3"  ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B; <italic>F</italic>(2,52) &#x0003c; 1, <italic>  p</italic> = .8].
