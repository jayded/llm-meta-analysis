<abstract><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The preventive impact of hospital-acquired infection (HAI) surveillance is difficult to assess. Our objective was to investigate the effect of HAI surveillance disruption on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A quasi-experimental study with an intervention group and a control group was conducted between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2010 in two intensive care units (ICUs) of a university hospital that participated in a national HAI surveillance network. Surveillance was interrupted during the year 2007 in unit A (intervention group) and was continuous in unit B (control group). Period 1 (pre-test period) comprised patients hospitalized during 2004 to 2006, and period 2 (post-test period) involved patients hospitalized during 2008 to 2010. Patients hospitalized &#x02265;48 hours and intubated during their stay were included. Multivariate Poisson regression was fitted to ascertain the influence of surveillance disruption.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2,771 patients, accounting for 19,848 intubation-days at risk, were studied; 307 had VAP. The VAP attack rate increased in unit A from 7.8% during period 1 to 17.1% during period 2 (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c;0.001); in unit B, it was 7.2% and 11.2% for the two periods respectively (<italic>P </italic>= 0.17). Adjusted VAP incidence rose in unit A after surveillance disruption (incidence rate ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.47, <italic>P </italic>= 0.036), independently of VAP trend; no change was observed in unit B. All-cause mortality and length of stay increased (<italic>P </italic>= 0.028 and <italic>P </italic>= 0.038, respectively) in unit A between periods 1 and 2. In unit B, no change in mortality was observed (<italic>P </italic>= 0.22), while length of stay decreased between periods 1 and 2 (<italic>P </italic>= 0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>VAP incidence, length of stay and all-cause mortality rose after HAI surveillance disruption in ICU, which suggests a specific effect of HAI surveillance on VAP prevention and reinforces the role of data feedback and counselling as a mechanism to facilitate performance improvement.</p></sec></abstract><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Of the 4,411 patients included in the surveillance of both units during the study period, 2,915 (61.1%) were exposed to mechanical ventilation during their hospital stay. Data were missing for 4.9% (n = 144) of intubated patients and were, therefore, excluded.</p><p>Totally, 2,771 patients, accounting for 37,330 hospitalisation days, 26,768 intubation-days and 19,848 intubation-days at risk, were analysed. Among them, 940 (34%) were hospitalised in unit A, and 1,831 (66%) in unit B. Overall, 62% (n = 1,724) were men, and mean &#x000b1; SD age was 60 &#x000b1; 16 years. Totally, 61% (n = 1,694) received antibiotics at admission, 41% (n = 1,142) came from home, and 26% (n = 721) were immunosuppressed. Mean &#x000b1; SD SAPSII score was 53 &#x000b1; 20. All-cause in-hospital mortality was 26% (n = 712).</p><p>Overall, 307 patients had VAP. The VAP attack rate was 11.1 per 100 intubated patients and the VAP incidence rate was 15.5 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 13.8 to 17.3) per 1,000 intubation-days at risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics by group and period</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> reports the characteristics of hospitalised patients by group and period.
