<abstract><p>Stress-related illnesses are a growing health problem in the Western world; which also has economic significance for society. As a consequence; there is a growing demand for effective treatments. The study investigates the long-term efficacy of the Nacadia<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> nature-based therapy (NNBT) by comparing it to the efficacy of a validated cognitive behavioral therapy, called STreSS. The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial in which 84 participants are randomly allocated between the treatments. Long-term efficacy is investigated through data extracts from the national database of Statistics Denmark on the sick leave and the health-care consumption. The results show that both the NNBT and the STreSS lead to a significant decrease in number of contacts with a general practitioner in the period from twelve months prior to treatment to twelve months after treatment; and, a significant decrease in long-term sick leave from the month prior to treatment to twelve months after treatment. The positive long-term effects provide validation for the NNBT as an efficient treatment of stress-related illnesses.</p></abstract><sec id="sec3-ijerph-15-00137"><title>3. Results</title><p>Of the 83 participants allocated between the two treatments, 41 participants completed the NBT treatment and 40 participants completed the CBT treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00137-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Four participants in the NBT were lost to follow-up because the correct personal identification number was not provided. Five participants were lost to follow-up in the CBT; four participants did not provide the correct personal identification number; and, one participant withdrew consent after the treatment.</p><p>The results from the background questionnaire showed that the vast majority of participants were women (NBT: 82%, CBT: 82%) with a mean age of 47.9 in NBT and 44.9 in CBT [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-00137" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The majority had a university bachelor degree or higher education (NBT: 76%, CBT: 68%). The categorization of participants with respect to socioeconomic status showed an even distribution between the two treatments; the majority of participants in both NBT and CBT were employed at the start of treatment (NBT = 20; CBT = 21), and a great number held a top-level position (NBT = 13; CBT = 12) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00137-t001">Table 1</xref>). A substantial proportion of participants were also registered as unemployed at treatment start (NBT = 18; CBT = 18). Of those, 17 participants from the NBT and 16 participants from the CBT were fired from work during the twelve months preceding the start of treatment. Moreover, one participant in the NBT and two participants in the CBT quit their job during that period.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-ijerph-15-00137"><title>3.1.
