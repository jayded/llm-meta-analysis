<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Rocuronium has been well known to produce withdrawal response in 50-80% patients when administered intravenously. Several drugs are administered prior injection of rocuronium to prevent the withdrawal response. We compared the preventive effect of lidocaine, ketamine, and remifentanil on the withdrawal response of rocuronium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 120 patients undergoing various elective surgeries were enrolled. Patients were allocated into 4 groups according to the pretreatment drugs (Group N, normal saline; Groups L, lidocaine 40 mg; Group K, ketamine 0.5 mg/kg; Group R, remifentanil 1 &#x000b5;g/kg). Patients received drugs prepared by dilution to 3 ml volume before injection of rocuronium. Withdrawal responses after injection of rocuronium were graded on a 4-point scale. Hemodynamic changes were observed before and after administration of pretreatment drugs and after endotracheal intubation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Incidence of withdrawal response was significantly lower in group L (20%), group K (30%), and group R (0%), than group N (87%). Severe withdrawal response was observed in 5 of the 30 patients (17%) in group L, and in 9 of the 30 patients (30%) in group K. There was no severe withdrawal response in group R. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were significantly decreased in group R compared to other groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>It seems that remifentanil (1 &#x000b5;g/kg intravenously) was the strongest and most effective in prevention of withdrawal response after rocuronium injection among the 3 drugs.</p></sec></abstract><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There were no dropouts and the data from all 120 patients could be analyzed. There were no significant differences among the groups in demographic data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The incidence of withdrawal response was 87% (26/30), 20% (6/30), 30% (9/30), and 0% in group N, group L, group K, and group R, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Severe withdrawal response which is &#x0003e;2 on the 4-point scale occurred in 25 patients (84%) in group N (P &#x0003c; 0.00833). However, it was observed in 5 patients (17%) in group L, in 9 patients (30%) in group K, and in no patient in group R, respectively. The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) to prevent pain in one who would have had pain was 1.49, 1.75, and 1.15 in group L, group K, and group R, respectively. Lidocaine (40 mg), ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), or remifentanil (1 &#x000b5;g/kg) decreased the withdrawal response significantly and remifentanil (1 &#x000b5;g/kg) was the most effective in the prevention of withdrawal response among the drugs (P &#x0003c; 0.00833) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>There were no significant differences in mean blood pressure and heart rate before injection of pretreatment drugs among the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).
