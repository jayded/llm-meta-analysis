<abstract><sec><title>OBJECTIVE</title><p>Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular mortality and increases adiponectin concentrations, but effects might differ according to sex and beverage consumed.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 72 healthy individuals (22&#x02013;56 years) were enrolled in this randomized controlled crossover trial. After washout, two interventions for 3 weeks followed: ethanol (concentration 12.5%), beer (5.6%), or red wine (12.5%) equivalent to 30 g ethanol/day for men and 20 g/day for women or the same de-alcoholized beverages or water. Adiponectin was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Among women, adiponectin significantly increased after consuming red wine (29.8%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and consuming beer (16.1%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). De-alcoholized beverages had no substantial effect on adiponectin concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Moderate amounts of ethanol-containing beverages increased adiponectin concentrations, but sex-specific effects might depend on type of beverage consumed.</p></sec></abstract><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Compliance was excellent according to self-report and counting of empty bottles returned. One participant was excluded because of protocol violation. Baseline characteristics including age, BMI, and liver enzymes did not differ within sexes and between intervention groups. Adiponectin concentrations were substantially higher among females (means 7.6&#x02013;8.8 &#x003bc;g/ml) than males (means 4.8&#x02013;6.3 &#x003bc;g/ml) but also did not differ between the intervention groups within each sex. Among females, adiponectin significantly increased after intervention with red wine (29.8%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and beer consumption (16.1%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.04).
