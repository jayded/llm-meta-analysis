<abstract><sec id="st1"><title>Objective:</title><p>The objective of this study is to examine the impact of vary doses of buprenorphine on anxiety symptoms in opioid-dependent inpatients over a 7 days period, using a randomized controlled trial design.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Design:</title><p>Patients were randomized to three groups.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>Fourteen men who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria for both opioid use disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and were seeking for treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Intervention:</title><p>Patients obtain dosages of 32 mg or 64 mg or 96 mg of buprenorphine as a single dose only and were treated in a psychiatric inpatient unit. Of 14 subjects; 5 (35.7%) obtained 32 mg, 4 (28.6%) obtained 64 mg, and 5 (35.7%) obtained 96 mg of buprenorphine.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Measurements:</title><p>Administering daily Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and interview.</p></sec><sec id="st6"><title>Results:</title><p>All the patients ended the 7-day treatment time. The results showed a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms within each of the three groups ( <italic>P</italic> = 0.00), but no difference in outcome between the groups ( <italic>P</italic> = 0.605).</p></sec><sec id="st7"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The outcome suggests a single high dose of buprenorphine can supply a speedy, safe, simple, and suitable means of anxiety treatment. The single high dose of buprenorphine could be a novel mechanism medication that provides a rapid and sustained improvement for generalized anxiety disorder in opioid dependent patients. Placebo-controlled trials of longer duration are needed to evaluate ability, safety, and psychological and physiological influence of extended exposure to this medication.</p></sec></abstract><sec id="sec1-3" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All the 14 inpatients completed the 7-day period study.
