<abstract id="Abs1"><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>To study the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of rising single doses of macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in healthy male subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in seven groups of eight healthy male subjects. Doses of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 and 600&#x000a0;mg or placebo (two subjects per group) were administered. Plasma macitentan and endothelin-1 and serum total bile salt concentrations were measured and analysed non-compartmentally. Plasma and urine were analysed qualitatively for the presence of metabolites and one of these, ACT-132577, was also measured quantitatively in plasma. Standard tolerability measurements were performed throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Macitentan was slowly absorbed and, at a dose of 300&#x000a0;mg, the t<sub>1/2</sub> (95% confidence interval, CI) was 17.5&#x000a0;h (14.1, 21.8). The dose-proportionality coefficient &#x003b2; for C<sub>max</sub> (95% CI) was 0.83 (0.79, 0.87) indicating less than dose-proportional pharmacokinetics of macitentan. In plasma, a pharmacologically active oxidative depropyl metabolite, ACT-132577, was found whereas in urine two minor metabolites were detected. The t<sub>1/2</sub> of ACT-132577 (95% CI) was 65.6&#x000a0;h (53.1, 80.9). Macitentan dose-dependently increased endothelin-1 concentrations up to 2.2-fold (95% CI 1.4, 2.4) at a dose of 600&#x000a0;mg, but had no consistent effect on total bile salts. Macitentan was well tolerated up to and including a dose of 300&#x000a0;mg, the maximum tolerated dose. Headache, nausea and vomiting were dose-limiting adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pharmacokinetic and tolerability profile of macitentan is consistent with a once-a-day dosing regimen and warrants further investigation in clinical studies.</p></sec></abstract><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Subjects and tolerability</title><p>Fifty-six healthy male Caucasian subjects (age range: 19&#x02013;49&#x000a0;years, body weight range: 55.4&#x02013;98.0&#x000a0;kg) participated in this study and all completed the study as per protocol. A summary of the adverse events reported during the study, including those adverse events judged to be unrelated to study medication, is provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. No unexpected adverse events, signs of oedema and/or serious adverse events were reported and all events resolved without sequelae. Up to and including a dose of 300&#x000a0;mg, the adverse event profile of macitentan did not significantly differ from that of placebo, whereas more adverse events than in the placebo group were reported at a dose of 600&#x000a0;mg. In this latter dose group, 5 out of 6 subjects reported headache of moderate intensity, accompanied by nausea and vomiting in 2 subjects. Two cases of increased alanine aminotransferase to about 2 times the upper limit of normal or less were observed: in a subject who had received 600&#x000a0;mg of macitentan and the other in a subject who had received placebo. Both cases occurred 7&#x000a0;days after drug administration, whereas 48&#x000a0;h after administration liver enzymes were normal. In neither subject was a significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase noted, nor were there any changes in total bile salt concentrations. There were no clinically significant drug-related effects on vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory variables. <table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Overview of reported adverse events by treatment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Adverse event</th><th colspan="8">Treatment (mg macitentan)</th></tr><tr><th>0.2</th><th>1</th><th>5</th><th>25</th><th>100</th><th>300</th><th>600</th><th>Placebo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headache</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Back pain</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hepatic function abnormal</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Nausea</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Rhinitis</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Vomiting</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Abdominal pain</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Flushing</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leukocytosis</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Nasopharyngitis</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Neck pain</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Number of subjects reporting adverse events after having received macitentan (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 per dose) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14)</p><p>Adverse events reported more than once by the same subject were counted once</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>The mean plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles and the pharmacokinetic variables of macitentan and its main metabolite are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Under fasting conditions, macitentan was absorbed slowly with a median t<sub>max</sub> varying from 8 to 30&#x000a0;h for the different dose groups. After attainment of C<sub>max</sub>, plasma concentrations decreased slowly. The apparent terminal half-life could only be reliably estimated for the two higher dose groups and was about 16&#x000a0;h. The pharmacokinetics of macitentan showed a less than dose-proportional increase for C<sub>max</sub> as indicated by a value for the dose proportionality coefficient &#x003b2; (95% CI) of 0.83 (0.79, 0.87). Formation of the depropyl metabolite was slow with maximum concentrations attained at least 30&#x000a0;h after dosing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In comparison to the parent compound, plasma concentrations of the metabolite were higher and elimination was slower as demonstrated by mean t<sub>1/2</sub> values varying from 40.2 to 65.6&#x000a0;h. This resulted in a total exposure (AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub>) to the metabolite that was 2.7-fold (95% CI 2.5, 2.9) greater than that to macitentan at a dose of 600&#x000a0;mg. <fig
