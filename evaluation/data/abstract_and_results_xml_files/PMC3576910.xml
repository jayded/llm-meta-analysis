<abstract id="Abs1"><sec><title>Background</title><p>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder in childhood, affecting 3&#x02013;7% of school-age children in the US and imposing substantial economic burden. Stimulants are considered first-line pharmacological treatment and are the most prescribed treatment for ADHD. However, approximately 30% of children with ADHD do not have an optimal response to a single stimulant and may require adjunctive therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>Our objective was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of adding a non-stimulant, guanfacine extended release (GXR), to stimulants versus maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A 1-year Markov model was developed to estimate costs and effectiveness from a US third-party payer perspective. Effectiveness was measured by the QALY. The model assumed that patients transitioned among four health states (normal, mild, moderate and severe), defined by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale. Transition probabilities were estimated in an ordered logit model using patient-level data from a multicentre, 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, where subjects (n=461) continued their stable morning stimulant and were randomized to GXR administered in the morning, GXR administered in the evening, or placebo. The model assumed that patients in moderate/severe health states after week 8 would discontinue ADHD treatment and remain in that state for the rest of the study period. Direct costs included drug wholesale acquisition costs and health state costs, all in $US, year 2010 values. Utility associated with each health state was obtained from the literature and disutilities associated with adverse events were applied for the first 4 weeks. Oneway sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted by varying costs, utilities, adverse-event duration, and transition probabilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared with maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy, adding GXR to existing stimulant monotherapy was associated with an incremental drug cost of $US1016 but a lower medical cost of $US124, resulting in a total incremental cost of $US892 at 1 year. The addition of GXR to stimulants led to an incremental QALY of 0.03 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $US31 660/QALY. In one-way sensitivity analysis, ICER values ranged from $US19 723, when 100% of patients were assumed to be severe in their initial health state, to $US46631, when the last observed states from the clinical trial were carried forward to the end of the 1-year analysis period. PSA demonstrated a 94.6% likelihood that the ICER falls below $US50 000/QALY.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The impairment associated with residual ADHD symptoms after stimulant therapy is becoming increasingly recognized. This is the first analysis of the cost effectiveness of stimulants combined with an adjunctive medication. This study suggests that the adjunctive therapy of GXR with stimulants is a cost-effective treatment based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $US50 000/QALY. This may address an unmet need among patients with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy.</p></sec></abstract><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Base-Case Analysis</title><p>Adding GXR as an adjunctive therapy to stimulants was associated with $US1016 higher costs for ADHD pharmacy medication costs ($US1690 vs $US675) but $US124 less in medical costs ($US1297 vs $US1421), leading to a total incremental cost of $US892 ($US2987 vs $US2095) compared with stimulant monotherapy. The combination therapy also increased QALYs by 0.028 (0.655 vs 0.627). Excluding the impact of AEs led to a QALY difference of 0.031 (0.660 vs 0.629). As a result, the ICER was $US31 660/QALY for treatment with GXR as an adjunctive therapy to stimulants compared with stimulant monotherapy among children and adolescents with ADHD who had a suboptimal response to stimulants (<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="fig">table III</xref>).</p><fig id="Tab3"><label>Table III</label><caption><p>Base-case results</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40273_2012_30080001_Tab3" id="MO4" /></fig></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Sensitivity Analysis</title><p>Results from the one-way sensitivity analyses showed that the ICER ranged from $US19 723/QALY, when all patients were assumed to start in the severe state, to $US46 631/QALY, when transition probabilities as observed in the trial were applied and patients were assumed not to transition beyond week 8 (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Overall, the results were sensitive to the assumptions for transition probabilities, initial health state distribution, and unit drug costs. All ICERs from the sensitivity analyses were within +/&#x02212;20% of the base-case value, with the exception of the following three assumptions: (i) transition probabilities as observed in the trial, (ii) 100% of patients starting with the severe health state, and (iii) AWPs as unit drug costs. When no medical cost offsets were assumed by using more efficacious treatment, the ICER increased from $US31 660/QALY to $US36 065/QALY. The PSA demonstrated a 94.6% likelihood that the ICER was less than $US50 000/QALY. The median ICER was shown to be $US32 720/QALY with a 95% CI of $US17 338/QALY to $US54 938/QALY (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="Fig2"><label>AE</label><caption><p>Fig. 2 Univariate sensitivity analysis.
