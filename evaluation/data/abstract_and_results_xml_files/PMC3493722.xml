<abstract><sec><title>Background/Aims</title><p>First-line therapies against <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) plus two antibiotics, may fail in up to 20% of patients. 'Rescue' therapy is usually needed for patients who failed the first-line treatment. This study evaluated the eradication rate of bismuth-containing quadruple rescue therapy over a 1- or 2-week period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We prospectively investigated 169 patients with a persistent <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection after the first-line triple therapy, which was administered from October 2008 to March 2010. The patients were randomized to receive a 1- or 2-week quadruple rescue therapy (pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d., tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg q.i.d., metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d.). After the 'rescue' therapy, the eradication rate, compliance, and adverse events were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The 1-week group achieved 83.5% (71/85) and 87.7% (71/81) eradication rates in the intention to treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses, respectively. The 2-week group obtained 87.7% (72/84) and 88.9% (72/81) eradication rate in the ITT and PP analyses, respectively. There was no significant difference in the eradication rate, patient compliance or rate of adverse events between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>One-week bismuth-containing quadruple therapy can be as effective as a 2-week therapy after the failure of the first-line eradication therapy.</p></sec></abstract><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All randomized 169 patients were eligible for ITT analysis. Among these patients, 85 patients received 1-week PPI+BMT and 84 patients received 2-week PPI+BMT. The main demographic and clinical features of 169 patients according to the two treatment arms are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Demographic characteristics were similar, except for higher proportion of patients with duodenal ulcers in the 2-week PPI+BMT group, as were symptoms at the initial assessment. Overall, seven patients had protocol violations that excluded them from PP analysis. Among these patients, four patients were in the 1-week PPI+BMT treatment group. Their violations were follow-up loss, inadequately taking medicine and discontinuing the therapy due to intolerable side effects. Thus, seven patients were dropped out from PP analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> shows the flow diagram of patients progress through the phases of the study. The 1-week PPI+BMT regimen achieved 83.5% (95% CI, 76% to 91%) eradication rate in ITT analysis and 87.7% (95% CI, 80% to 95%) in PP analysis, while the 2-week PPI+BMT regiment obtained 87.7% (95% CI, 78% to 93%) eradication rate in ITT and 88.9% (95% CI, 82% to 96%) in PP analysis. There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment modalities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The compliance rates of the 1-week PPI+MBT group were 91.4% 'good' compliance, 9.9% 'well' compliance and 2.5% 'poor' compliance. In the 2-week PPI+MBT treatment group, the compliance rates were 91.4%, 4.6%, and 3.7%, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Overall, 52 patients reported side-effects, i.e., 19 patients (22.4%) in the 1-week PPI+BMT group and 32 patients (38.1%) in the 2-week PPI+BMT group. Diarrhea, headache, vomiting, stool color change, itching, nausea, taste disturbance, and abdominal pain were reported as side effects. There was no statistically significant difference in side effects between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Only one patient from each group withdrew from the study due to significant side effects. The prevalence of side effects was not significantly increased with treatment duration. In both groups, most patients tolerated well the side effects and continued medication with encouragement from the physician, even when the side effects were rather serious.</p></sec><floats-group><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram showing the phases of the study progress.
