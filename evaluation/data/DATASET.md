## Dataset

### Annotated Dataset

The annotated dataset can be found in either csv or json formats.
`annotated_rct_dataset.csv` and `annotated_rct_dataset.json`

We provide all the different versions of trial report text (only abstracts and results sections) of 120 RCTs we included in our dataset.

1. `abstract_and_results_xml_files` include the raw xml text.
2. `no_attributes_xml_files` include the xml text without any attributes (stylistic tags).
3. `no_attributes_markdown_files` include the markdown versions of the text. This is the version that we use as inputs to the LLMs.
