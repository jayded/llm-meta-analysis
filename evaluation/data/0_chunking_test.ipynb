However, few controlled trials have evaluated this treatment modality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using data from a recent randomized trial comparing daptomycin with standard therapy (semi-synthetic penicillin or vancomycin, each with initial low-dose gentamicin) for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia and infective endocarditis (SAB/IE), patient characteristics and outcomes were evaluated. Patients receiving their full course of therapy in the hospital setting were compared with those who received some portion outside of the hospital (CoPAT).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among the 200 patients, 51.5% received CoPAT. These patients were generally younger (median age 50 versus 54 years, P = 0.028). In the CoPAT group, there tended to be fewer patients with endocardial involvement (8.7% versus 18.6%, P = 0.061) and pre-existing valvular heart disease (7.8% versus 15.5%, P = 0.120). CoPAT patients received longer therapy courses (mean 25.4 versus 13.5 days, P &lt; 0.001) and had higher rates of therapy completion (90.3% versus 45.4%, P &lt; 0.001) and clinical success (86.4% versus 55.7%, P &lt; 0.001). Persisting or relapsing S. aureus was less frequent in the CoPAT group (3.9% versus 15.5%, P = 0.007) and there were fewer deaths (3.9% versus 18.6%, P = 0.001) 6 weeks after the end of therapy. Hospital readmission occurred for 18 of the 103 (17.5%) CoPAT patients. Clinical success rates were similar for CoPAT patients receiving daptomycin (90.0%) or standard therapy (83.0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>With proper monitoring, stable patients can complete treatment for SAB/IE as outpatients in the community setting. Daptomycin is an appropriate option for this setting.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Two hundred US patients were included in this analysis, with 103 (51.5%) receiving part of their treatment outside of the hospital setting (CoPAT). The majority of CoPAT patients (69/103, 67.0%) were discharged home without assistance and two others (1.9%) went home with assistance. Nineteen of the 103 CoPAT patients (18.4%) were discharged to a skilled nursing facility, while 13/103 (12.6%) were treated in an assisted-living setting, nursing home or rehabilitation centre. The study database did not systematically record the types of venous access devices used to deliver CoPAT. In general, peripherally inserted central catheters were the preferred means of securing venous access.</p><p>Compared with patients who received all care in the hospital, CoPAT patients were younger (median age 50 versus 54 years, P = 0.028) and tended to have fewer cases of endocardial involvement (8.7% versus 18.6%; P = 0.061) as well as less pre-existing valvular heart disease (7.8% versus 15.5%, P = 0.120). The two groups had a similar distribution of diagnoses (Figure 1) and a similar distribution of study medications.

However, no previous  study has tested whether reducing negative attentional bias causally affects  risk factors for depressive recurrence. The current experimental medicine  study reports the effects of a computerized attentional bias modification  (ABM) procedure on intermediate measures of the risk of depressive  recurrence (residual depressive symptoms and the cortisol awakening  response) in patients with recurrent depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty-one patients with at least two previous episodes of depression who were  currently in remission were randomized to receive either an active  (positive) or placebo computer-based ABM regime. The ABM regime presented  either pictures of faces or words. Residual depressive symptoms, measured  using the Beck Depression Inventory and the cortisol awakening response were  measured immediately before and after completion of the bias modification  and then again after 4 weeks' follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Positive, face-based ABM reduced both measures of recurrence risk (Beck  Depression Inventory and cortisol awakening response). This effect occurred  during the month following completion of bias modification.

      "<sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Group Demographics, Baseline Measures, and Compliance</title><p>As can be seen from Table 1, the groups were  well matched on baseline demographics, IQ, and measures of illness severity. Patients  had been depressed on an average of three previous occasions. Compliance was generally  high with only eight patients completing fewer than 25 sessions of ABM and no difference  in compliance between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>The Effect of ABM on Residual Symptoms</title><p>Positive, relative to placebo, ABM influenced the residual depressive symptoms reported  by patients using the BDI, but this effect depended on whether the ABM used faces or  words [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; F(2,112) = 3.7,   p = .03]. There was no general ABM type × time effect [F(2,112)  = 1.1, p = .35]. As can be seen from Figure  2 positive, face-based ABM lead to a reduction of symptoms compared with placebo  ABM [Figure 2A; F(2,56) = 3.7, p  = .03], whereas word based ABM had no significant effect [Figure 2B; F(2,56) &lt; 1,   p = .4]. Interestingly, the beneficial effect of positive face ABM  displayed a time lag; symptoms did not change across the 2 weeks of ABM [  F(1,28) &lt; 1, p = .5]; rather, they reduced during  the follow-up period [F(1,28) = 5.9, p = .02] with  this change resulting from a significant drop in symptoms reported by the positive face  ABM group [t(15) = 2.4, p = .03] and no significant  change seen in the placebo face ABM group [t(13) &lt; 1, p  = .4].</p><p>Observer reported depressive symptoms, measured using the HRSD, revealed an identical ABM  type × ABM stimuli × time interaction [Figure 2C and 2D; F(2,112) = 3.4, p =  .04]; however, in this case, the post hoc tests of the interaction for face training was  significant only at a trend level [F(1,28) = 2.9,   p = .09].</p><p>Symptoms of anxiety, measured using the trait subscale of the STAI displayed the same  specific effect of positive face ABM as that seen for the BDI [Figures 2E, F; F(2,112) = 3.3,   p = .05] with the beneficial effect again occurring during follow-up [  F(1,28) = 5.2, p = .03] and being driven by a significant  reduction of anxious symptoms in the positive face ABM group [t(15) =  2.4, p = .03].</p></sec><sec><title>The Effect of ABM on the CAR</title><p>Analysis of the CAR response revealed a significant ABM type × ABM stimuli  interaction [F(1,53) = 4.3, p = .04], which was  present across the three time points [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time;   F(2,106)&lt;1, p = .4]. In keeping with the effects on  residual symptoms, face-based ABM influenced the CAR [Figure 3A; F(2,54) = 4, p =  .02], whereas word-based ABM did not [Figure 3B; F(2,52) &lt; 1,   p = .8]. Specifically, positive relative to placebo face ABM caused a  reduction of the CAR across the follow-up period [F(1,27) = 5,   p = .03] with no change being seen during ABM [F(1,27)  &lt; 1, p = .9]. This relative reduction was produced by a  nonsignificant decrease in the positive ABM group during follow-up [t(14)  = 1.7, p = .1] and a nonsignificant increase in the placebo group [  t(13) = 1.5, p = .2].</p></sec><sec><title>The Effect of ABM on Attentional Function</title><p>Positive relative to placebo bias modification produced a differential effect on  attentional bias (Figure 4), as measured by the  word based visual-probe task [ABM type × time; F(2,112) = 3.1,   p = .05]. However, unlike the previous results, this effect did not  significantly differ between the face- and word-trained groups [ABM type × ABM  stimuli × time; F(2,112) &lt; 1,   p = .9]. The effect of ABM was seen across the bias modification period [  F(1,57) = 8.3, p = .006] with no significant change occurring  across follow-up [F(1,56) &lt; 1, p = .4]. When  considering the within group effects produced, positive-face ABM led to a significant  increase in positive bias across the modification period [t(15) = 3.7,   p = .002], whereas face placebo ABM did not change the bias [t(13)  &lt; 1, p = .9]. Interestingly, the effect of word ABM was driven  by a trend level decrease in bias in the placebo word group [t(14) =  2.1, p = .051] with no effect seen for positive word ABM [  t(15)&lt;1, p = .5]. The correlation between change  in attentional bias across the bias modification period and reduction in BDI or CAR  across the follow-up period in the positive face-ABM group was not significant [  r(16) = .37, not significant, and r(15) = .34, not  significant, respectively]. Additional analysis is provide in Supplement 1.</p><p>Attentional bias, assessed using face stimuli, was insensitive to the effect of the ABM  interventions [F(2,112)&lt;1, p = 1]. This  remained the case when analysis was restricted to those who had completed face based ABM  [F(2,56) &lt; 1, p = .7].</p></sec></sec><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design and attentional bias modification (ABM) task used.

During positive ABM (shown)  the probe appeared behind the more positive of the two stimuli; the placebo ABM  condition was identical in every respect other than that the probe was equally  likely to appear behind either stimulus. The stimuli used during ABM were either  faces (shown) or words.</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig>\n",

      "<abstract><sec><title>OBJECTIVES:</title><p>To evaluate the importance of providing guidelines to patients via active telephone calls for blood pressure control and for preventing the discontinuation of treatment among hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec><title>INTRODUCTION:</title><p>Many reasons exist for non-adherence to medical regimens, and one of the strategies employed to improve treatment compliance is the use of active telephone calls.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Hypertensive patients (n = 354) who could receive telephone calls to remind them of their medical appointments and receive instruction about hypertension were distributed into two groups: a) “uncomplicated” – hypertensive patients with no other concurrent diseases and b) “complicated” - severe hypertensive patients (mean diastolic ≥110 mmHg with or without medication) or patients with comorbidities. All patients, except those excluded (n = 44), were open-block randomized to follow two treatment regimens (“traditional” or “current”) and to receive or not receive telephone calls (“phone calls” and “no phone calls” groups, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Significantly fewer patients in the “phone calls” group discontinued treatment compared to those in the “no phone calls” group (4 vs. 30; p&lt;0.0094). There was no difference in the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure in the “phone calls” group and “no phone calls” group or in the “traditional” and “current” groups. The percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (&lt;140/90 mmHg) was increased at the end of the treatment (74%), reaching 80% in the “uncomplicated” group and 67% in the “complicated” group (p&lt;0.000001).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p>Guidance to patients via active telephone calls is an efficient strategy for preventing the discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment.</p></sec></abstract><title>RESULTS</title><p>The study included 398 patients. Of those, 44 were excluded for the following reasons: a) lack of enrollment in the Biosintética Assistance program (n = 17); b) body mass index &gt;40 kg/m2 (n = 6); c) secondary hypertension (n = 4); d) white-coat hypertension (n = 3); e) white-coat normotension (“masked hypertension”) (n = 3); f) alcohol use (n = 2); g) classification error (n = 4); h) refusal to do ABPM (n = 2); i) loss of blood pressure measurements from the first visit (n = 1); j) pregnancy (n = 1); k) death (n = 1). A total of 354 patients were evaluated.</p><p>There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, skin color, body mass index, blood pressure or heart rate between the groups classified as: “complicated” (n = 175) and “uncomplicated” (n = 179); “traditional” (n = 176) and “current” (n = 178); “phone calls” (n = 108) and “no phone calls” (n = 246) (Table 1). In addition, no differences were seen in marital status, education or occupation.</p><sec><title>a) Control of Blood Pressure</title><p>A marked reduction in blood pressure was seen in patients from both the “complicated” and “uncomplicated” groups (Table 2). The blood pressure was reduced by 19±10/20±14 mmHg in the “uncomplicated” group and by 18±14/22±17 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) in the “complicated” group (p&gt;0.05; n = 354).</p><p>The “phone calls” and “no phone calls” groups showed significantly lower blood pressures at the end of treatment (p&lt; 0.00001). The “traditional” and “current” groups showed significantly lower blood pressures at the end of treatment (Figure 1).</p><p>The percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (&lt;140/90 mmHg) was also high at the end of treatment (74%). On the other hand, the percentage of patients with blood pressure reduced to &lt;120/80 mmHg was only 29%. There was no difference in the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure between the “phone calls” and “no phone calls” groups or in the reduction of blood pressure and the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure among the “traditional” and “current” treatments. However, patients in the “phone calls” group (80%) had better blood pressure control than those in the “no phone calls” group (71%), though the difference was not statistically significant. The “uncomplicated” and “complicated” groups had statistically significant differences in the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (&lt;140/90 mmHg) (80% vs. 67%, respectively; p&lt;0.000001). At the next to last study visit (visit 7), 90% and 66% of patients had blood pressure measurements &lt;140/90 mmHg in the “uncomplicated” and “complicated” groups, respectively. However, there was no difference in the percentage of patients with blood pressure &lt;120/80 mmHg (31% on the final visit in both groups, Table 3).</p><p>Among patients with a blood pressure &lt;140/90 mmHg at the final visit, only 3% had received only one type of antihypertensive medication; most patients (56%) received 2 (34%) or 3 (22%) types of antihypertensive medication (Table 4).</p></sec><sec><title>b) Treatment Discontinuation</title><p>A significantly lower number of patients in the “phone calls” group quit the treatment compared to the “no phone calls” group (4 vs. 30, respectively; Figure 2). There was no difference in the percentage discontinuation in the “complicated” and “uncomplicated” groups or in the “current” and “traditional” treatment regimens (p&gt;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>c) Tablet Count</title><p>Patients in the groups: “complicated” and “uncomplicated”; “traditional” and “current”; “phone calls” and “no phone calls” did not show statistically significant differences in medication intake, as verified by counting the tablets returned at the visits. Compliance was over 85% at all visits. However, patients in the current + uncomplicated + phone call group had the highest rate of compliance (93%). The lowest rate of compliance occurred in the traditional + uncomplicated + no phone call group (85%) (p&gt;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>d) Body Weight</title><p>Blood pressure reductions occurred in the presence of increased body weight (baseline visit: 73±14 kg; final visit: 74±14 kg, p = 0.0008, Table 5).</p></sec>\n",

In mild AD patients, WMS-R improved significantly in the treatment group, and the between group difference was nearly significant (P = 0.067). In a subgroup analysis of mild AD patients, WMS-R significantly improved among females and those aged below 77 years in the treatment group, and the between-group differences were statistically significant in females (P = 0.017) and in those aged below 77 years (P = 0.029). Patients with mild AD showed a significantly greater decrease in plasma PlsPE in the placebo group than in the treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Oral administration of scallop-derived purified Pls may improve cognitive functions of mild AD.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><funding-source>The Japanese Plasmalogen Society</funding-source>.                     </p></sec></abstract><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Study Participants</title><p>A total of 328 patients were enrolled at 25 hospitals or clinics in Kyushu, Kanto, and Kansai regions in Japan from November 15, 2014 to October 8, 2015. They were randomly assigned to either of the two treatment groups (166 to Pls group and 162 to placebo group). Of the 328 enrolled patients, 285 continued to participate in the study for 12 weeks, and 276 completed the 24 week study period. Those who completed the study included 11 patients (4.0%) who failed to use 80% or more of the provided test substance. Fig. 1 shows the trial profile.</p><p>No significant difference was noted between the groups with respect to age, MMSE-J, GDS-S-J, WMS-R (0 min), WMS-R (30 min), erythrocyte PlsPE, and plasma PlsPE, at baseline, although the male-to-female ratio was significantly lower in the placebo group (Table 1).</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Clinical Efficacy</title><sec><label>3.2.1</label><title>Primary Analysis</title><p>In an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups in the primary and secondary outcomes of cognitive function. The MMSE-J score showed a nearly significant improvement in the treatment group while no such improvement was observed in the placebo group, resulting no statistically significant between-group difference. The WMS-R (0 min) and WMS-R (30 min) score each showed a significant improvement in both groups, but there was no statistically significant between-group difference. Erythrocyte PlsPE increased and plasma PlsPE decreased to different degrees after treatment in both Pls and placebo groups. There was no statistically significant between-group difference at any points of time, while the decrease in plasma PlsPE seemed greater in the placebo group (Table 2).</p></sec><sec><label>3.2.2</label><title>Subgroup Analysis</title><p>We examined the change in cognitive function in mild AD patients and MCI patients separately. No notable change was seen in MMSE-J in either group. WMS-R (0 min) and WMS-R (30 min) improved statistically significantly in the treatment group, and the improvement seemed greater in the Pls treatment group with respect to the 0 min value (P = 0.067) and the 30-min value (P = 0.078) (Table 3).</p></sec><sec><label>3.2.3</label><title>Subgroup Analysis by Gender and Age</title><p>Furthermore, we analyzed the cognitive function in patients with mild AD patients by gender and age (Table 4). Mild AD patients were divided into two groups based on the median value, 77 years or younger and 78 years or older. In the patients aged 77 years or younger, WMS-R (30 min) increased statistically significantly in the treatment group, showing a significant between-group difference (P = 0.029). In female patients with mild AD, WMS-R (30 min) improved significantly in the treatment group, with a significant between-group difference (P = 0.017). There was no notable between-group difference in the analysis of MCI patients by gender and age.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2.4</label><title>Changes in Blood Plasmalogens</title><p>The changes in blood PlsPE levels among mild AD patients were examined (Table 5). Plasma PlsPE decreased in the placebo group, showing a significant between-group difference (P = 0.016). There was a statistically significant elevation of erythrocyte PlsPE at week 16 in the treatment group and at week 24 in placebo. However, the changes were not significantly different between the two groups.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Clinical Safety</title><p>Table 6 summarizes adverse events.

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>It is important that potential study participants are appropriately informed and understand what is involved with their research participation. A few studies have examined study participants’ understanding of the informed consent process and the adequacy of the information they received when agreeing to participate in a randomised controlled trial. Deficiencies in the consent process have been found. This topic remains an under researched area of acupuncture research. The aim of this study was to examine participants’ understanding of their informed consent and the adequacy of the information presented when agreeing to participate in a randomised controlled trial of acupuncture.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>All women who participated in a randomised controlled trial over an 11 month period were invited to participate in a survey. An anonymous self-completion questionnaire was designed and covered participants’ understanding of informed consent in the clinical trial, their views of the information provided, the opportunity to ask questions, the use of sham acupuncture, their recall of study visits and processes for withdrawal, and their reason for participating in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A response rate of 59 % was obtained. Over 90 % of subjects indicated there was plenty of opportunity to discuss the study prior to giving consent, and 89 % indicated that questions asked were answered to their satisfaction. The majority of women indicated the amount of information describing acupuncture was about right, however 24 % would have liked more. Information describing sham acupuncture was not considered adequate by 48 % of women, and 35 % would have liked more information, 30 % could not recall why, or were uncertain why a sham group was used. Participants indicated less understanding of the information relating to payment if they became ill due to study participation, risks and discomforts from the study interventions, which of the procedures were experimental and for how long they would be involved in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Trial participants’ understanding of informed consent was overall satisfactory but highlighted some areas of deficiency.

      "<sec><title>Understanding of the patient information</title><p>We asked about participants’ understanding of the study based upon the written information they received and follow up verbal interaction with study staff (Table 3 Appendix 1, question 5). The majority of participants clearly understood what the study involved with overall mean scores of 4 in response to these questions. There were five areas in which participants indicated less understanding, these related to payment if they became ill due to their participation in the study, risks and discomforts from the study interventions, which of the procedures were experimental and for how long they would be involved in the study. In addition, over 75 % recalled they were required to attend for treatment on two occasions, and 50 % could accurately recall when they were required to complete questionnaires.<table-wrap><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Participants understanding of the study</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>n = 199 </th><th>Mean</th><th>SD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The fact that participation is voluntary</td><td>4.6</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>That your treatment involved research</td><td>4.5</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>What the researchers were trying to find out</td><td>4.3</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Treatments and procedures you would undergo</td><td>4.3</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>How your participation may benefit future patients</td><td>4.3</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Possible benefits from participating in the trial</td><td>4.2</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Overall how well you understood the study when you signed the consent form</td><td>4.2</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Who to contact if you have questions</td><td>4.3</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Possible trial risks and discomforts</td><td>3.8</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>How long you would be in the trial</td><td>3.8</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Which treatments were experimental</td><td>3.7</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Alternatives to participation in the trial</td><td>3.6</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Who will pay for treatment if you become ill/injured</td><td>3.0</td><td>1.5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We explored participants’ understanding of selected areas relating to questions about the trial and the research terminology used in the patient information sheets through open-ended questions. Participant responses indicated some deficiencies. Over 82 % of responses indicated women could recall what a RCT meant. Responses were illustrated by the following quotations “I will be selected at random to be in the real or sham acupuncture group to assess the effect of acupuncture on live birth rates”. Many participants responded indicating their understanding of randomisation and blinding, for example, “that the person is randomly picked to be in the sham or real acupuncture group”, “I will be allocated to either a treatment or a control group, blind study means I won’t be aware of which group I was allocated to”. Some subjects responded by discussing the randomisation process, “its like a name in a hat you get randomly drawn to have either real or placebo acupuncture”, and “ where a computer randomly selects which group you will be in”. Incorrect responses reflected responses relating to blinding “ no one knows which group you are in”, participants receive either sham or actual treatment without knowing which one”, or general responses relating to the purpose of the study “its a experiment used to test the effectiveness of something in this case the acupuncture meridians on the pregnancy success rates in IVF patients”.</p><p>We asked why was sham acupuncture used? Thirty percent could not recall why or were uncertain, and 69 % provided an explanation. Many described it in terms of a non-specific effect relating it to the placebo effect, “because it was the placebo treatment, you need to see whether the outcomes would be affected by receiving acupuncture or not”, “to rule out the placebo effect, or to rule it in”, “to see if it is all in the mind”. Others indicated their understanding of the use of a control group, “ to determine if real acupuncture does actually cause more pregnancies”, “as a control group to eliminate changes caused by bias or belief”, “to see if specific points had results that can be compared against the sham results”. “Sham acupuncture is used to control for the physiological and psychological effects”.</p><p>Fifty nine percent of participants indicated they could not recall the process to withdraw from the study with an additional 16 % responding they were unclear. Of those indicating they understood the process for withdrawing, a small number mentioned they could withdraw any time, however the majority of participants responded to this question by explaining they were of aware of the process to contact the site research nurse or the trial co-ordinator to communicate their intention to withdraw.</p><p>Recall of the potential risks and side effects was poor. Over 41 % could not describe any side effects or risks and a further 29 % were unsure. Twenty eight percent of women listed side effects, with the majority accurately recalling acupuncture side effects listed on the information sheet including slight discomfort, pain from needling, and the less frequently occurring events relation to feeling lighted heads, nausea, and dizziness. Five inaccurately recalled a risk of infection.</p></sec>\n",

      "<abstract><p>Artemisinin combination therapies are available in private outlets, but patient adherence might be compromised by poor advice from dispensers. In this cluster randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Eligible patients purchasing AL at shops in both arms were followed up at home and questioned about each dose taken. Dispensers were interviewed regarding knowledge of AL dispensing practices and receipt of the malaria-related text messages. We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9). Further studies on the potential of text messages to improve adherence are needed.</p></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>Figure 1 shows the trial profile. Of the 82 randomized ADDOs, 37 from the control arm and 40 from the intervention arm participated in the study. The number of registered patients eligible for follow-up was 537 in the control arm and 518 in the intervention arm, with ∼15% of patients in each arm lost to follow-up. Most outlets were in urban wards (70% in both arms), had a single dispenser, and had at least some ACTs in stock on the day of interview (Table 1). Of 51 dispensers in the control arm and 59 in the intervention arm, ∼80% in both arms were female and had a low-level medical qualification, mostly nurse assistants (Table 2). Though low in both arms, more ADDOs in the control arm compared with the intervention arm were able to show an accreditation certificate (43% versus 20%, respectively). However, the difference in the percentages of dispensers that had received training on ACTs was not as pronounced (69% in the control arm versus 60% in the intervention arm), though the median year of training was more recent in the control arm (2011 versus 2009). </p><p>Characteristics of patients were well balanced between arms (Table 3). A high percentage of patients (36% in the control arm and 38% in the intervention arm) had sought care before attending the study ADDO, with most patients going to a kiosk or general shop and only 7% of patients in the control arm and 4% in the intervention arm going to a public health facility. Approximately 90% reported symptoms of fever or headache, and approximately half had upset stomachs or nausea. Based on an mRDT taken at the time of follow-up, 28% in the control arm and 25% in the intervention arm tested positive, with only 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively, testing positive by study blood smear. (Some degree of discrepancy is expected because of the persistence of HRP2 detected by the mRDT.)</p><p>Seventy percent of dispensers received at least 75% of the text messages. The median percentage of messages received was 86%, with 20% of dispensers receiving no messages (Figure 3). Table 4 presents results of the dispenser interviews on knowledge of advice to provide patients when dispensing AL. Dispensers in the intervention arm reported slightly better knowledge of the correct AL regimen for adults in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (90% versus 78%; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95, 1.5); p [adjusted] = 0.0748), though knowledge of the correct regimen for a child aged four weighing 20 kg was lower than for adults in both arms (75% versus 64%; aPR = 1.2 [0.85, 1.7]; p [adjusted] = 0.2). Dispenser knowledge was considerably higher in the intervention arm than the control arm on advice to take AL with fatty food (60% versus 20%; aPR = 3.4 [95% CI: 1.6, 7.1]; p [adjusted] &lt; 0.0001) and to continue to take AL if minor side effects occur (68% versus 43%; aPR = 1.6 [95% CI: 1.0, 2.4]; p [adjusted] = 0.0188). However, surprisingly high dispenser knowledge (87–99%) was recorded in both arms on advice to complete treatment even if feeling better, advice to return to the ADDO or go to a health facility if the condition worsens, and advice to take the second dose after 8 hours (Table 4). Knowledge on advising patients to take a replacement dose in case of vomiting within half an hour of taking a dose was lower (55% versus 50%), with no difference observed between arms.</p><fig><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Percentage of text messages received by dispensers in the intervention arm.</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><p>Table 5 shows that ∼60% of patients in both arms reported being told how to take AL correctly, with similar percentages reporting being told to take the second dose after 8 hours and to complete treatment even if feeling better, indicating that dispensers were providing some advice even in the absence of the intervention. However, no differences were found between control and intervention arms for any piece of advice. Less than 5% of patients in both arms reported being told about vomiting, side effects, or taking AL with fatty food, and &lt; 10% in both arms took the first dose of AL at the ADDO. </p><p>There was no difference in patient adherence between arms (Table 6). Completed treatment was 70% in the control arm and 68% in the intervention arm (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 0.96 [95% CI: 0.82, 1.1]; p [adjusted] = 0.6), with a similar percentage of patients adherent to each of the four age-appropriate blister packs and no important differences between arms. The mean number of doses taken by non-adherent patients was four in both arms, and the most common reported reasons for non-adherence included planning to take the medication later, forgetting to take the tablets, feeling better, and other reasons (Figure 4). Timely completion was much lower, with 33% of patients in both arms taking all doses at appropriate times. A per protocol analysis, excluding patients attending ADDOs where at least one dispenser did not receive any messages, had no impact on results.</p><fig><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Reasons given by patients/caretakers for not completing treatment.</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig></sec>\n",

Subgingival plaque samples were collected from four periodontal sites with clinical attachment level ≥1 mm, probing pocket depth ≥4 mm and bleeding on probing, one site in each quadrant. Samples were cultivated and processed using the PCR technique. Patients received nonsurgical therapy including scaling and root planing (SRP) and were randomly assigned to a probiotic (n=16), antibiotic (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15) group. L. rhamnosus SP1 was taken once a day for 3 months. Azithromycin 500mg was taken once a day for 5 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All groups showed improvements in clinical and microbiological parameters at all time points evaluated. Probiotic and antibiotic groups showed greater reductions in cultivable microbiota compared with baseline.

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Elobixibat is a minimally absorbed ileal bile acid (BA) transporter (IBAT) inhibitor in development against chronic constipation (CC) and constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C). CC is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type2 diabetes mellitus. The objectives of this study were to evaluate metabolic effects of elobixibat. Effects on plasma lipids and BA synthesis were evaluated utilizing a 4-week, placebo-controlled study in patients with dyslipidemia while changes of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by elobixibat was assayed in samples from a 14 day high-dose elobixibat study in patients with CC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-six dyslipidemic patients, 21 females, mean age 63 years, were randomized to 2.5 mg or 5 mg elobixibat or placebo once daily for four weeks.

Among these patients, 85 patients received 1-week PPI+BMT and 84 patients received 2-week PPI+BMT. The main demographic and clinical features of 169 patients according to the two treatment arms are shown in Table 1. Demographic characteristics were similar, except for higher proportion of patients with duodenal ulcers in the 2-week PPI+BMT group, as were symptoms at the initial assessment. Overall, seven patients had protocol violations that excluded them from PP analysis. Among these patients, four patients were in the 1-week PPI+BMT treatment group. Their violations were follow-up loss, inadequately taking medicine and discontinuing the therapy due to intolerable side effects. Thus, seven patients were dropped out from PP analysis. Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram of patients progress through the phases of the study. The 1-week PPI+BMT regimen achieved 83.5% (95% CI, 76% to 91%) eradication rate in ITT analysis and 87.7% (95% CI, 80% to 95%) in PP analysis, while the 2-week PPI+BMT regiment obtained 87.7% (95% CI, 78% to 93%) eradication rate in ITT and 88.9% (95% CI, 82% to 96%) in PP analysis. There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment modalities (Table 2). The compliance rates of the 1-week PPI+MBT group were 91.4% 'good' compliance, 9.9% 'well' compliance and 2.5% 'poor' compliance. In the 2-week PPI+MBT treatment group, the compliance rates were 91.4%, 4.6%, and 3.7%, respectively (Table 2). Overall, 52 patients reported side-effects, i.e., 19 patients (22.4%) in the 1-week PPI+BMT group and 32 patients (38.1%) in the 2-week PPI+BMT group. Diarrhea, headache, vomiting, stool color change, itching, nausea, taste disturbance, and abdominal pain were reported as side effects. There was no statistically significant difference in side effects between the two groups (Table 3). Only one patient from each group withdrew from the study due to significant side effects. The prevalence of side effects was not significantly increased with treatment duration.

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Aphasia affects one third of acute stroke patients. There is a considerable spontaneous recovery in aphasia, but impaired communication ability remains a great problem. Communication difficulties are an impediment to rehabilitation. Early treatment of the language deficits leading to increased communication ability would improve rehabilitation. The aim of this study is to elucidate the efficacy of very early speech and language therapy (SLT) in acute stroke patients with aphasia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective, open, randomized, controlled trial was carried out with blinded endpoint evaluation of SLT, starting within 2 days of stroke onset and lasting for 21 days. 123 consecutive patients with acute, first-ever ischemic stroke and aphasia were randomized. The SLT treatment was Language Enrichment Therapy, and the aphasia tests used were the Norsk grunntest for afasi (NGA) and the Amsterdam-Nijmegen everyday language test (ANELT), both performed by speech pathologists, blinded for randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The primary outcome, as measured by ANELT at day 21, was 1.3 in the actively treated patient group and 1.2 among controls. NGA led to similar results in both groups. Patients with a higher level of education (&gt;12 years) improved more on ANELT by day 21 than those with &lt;12 years of education (3.4 vs. 1.0, respectively). In 34 patients in the treatment group and 19 in the control group improvement was ≥1 on ANELT (p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference in the degree of aphasia at baseline except for fluency, which was higher in the group responding to treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Very early intensive SLT with the Language Enrichment Therapy program over 21 days had no effect on the degree of aphasia in unselected acute aphasic stroke patients. In aphasic patients with more fluency, SLT resulted in a significant improvement as compared to controls. A higher educational level of &gt;12 years was beneficial.</p></sec></abstract>\n",

Follow-up at 6 months could be performed in 99 patients (80%). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the study groups, except for a history of myocardial infarction, which was more frequent in the intervention group (table 1). At the follow-up at 6 months, 5 patients in the intervention group and 6 in the control group had died. Five patients in each group had recurrent stroke. All recurrent strokes occurred beyond the 3 weeks of intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary and Secondary Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome in the whole group as measured by ANELT by day 21 was 1.3 among the SLT-treated patients and 1.2 among the controls (table 2). The Diff Coeff was 8.5 in the SLT group and 9 in the control group. Also, per protocol analyses of ANELT by day 21 and for Diff Coeff revealed no statistical difference between the two study groups (table 2).</p><p>Patients with a higher level of education (&gt;12 years) improved more in ANELT by day 21 than those with &lt;12 years of education [3.4 (1.0–4.8) vs. 1.0 (1.0–2.7); p &lt; 0.01]. Diff Coeff improved more in patients with &gt;12 years of education than in those with &lt;12 years of education [13 (8–26) vs. 8 (1–16); p &lt; 0.01].</p><p>Higher values of ANELT, Coeff, fluency, and comprehension at baseline had a positive effect on ANELT by day 21 (p &lt; 0.01), while worse neurological performance as indicated by higher NIHSS values at baseline and longer delay to inclusion had a negative effect on ANELT by day 21 (p &lt; 0.01) and on Diff Coeff (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>A multivariate analysis including baseline ANELT, Coeff, fluency, and NIHSS at baseline, as well as age, gender, delay to inclusion, intervention group, and level of education, confirmed that initial ANELT and length of education had an independent, significant impact on the primary outcome (i.e. ANELT by day 21). For secondary outcome (i.e. Diff Coeff), the impact of the initial NIHSS and educational level were significant.</p><p>The types of aphasia are shown in figure 2. There were no differences in aphasia types between the two groups. Only 9 patients had a fluent type of aphasia at baseline, and there were no differences in fluent/non-fluent types of aphasia between the two groups. Best outcome according to ANELT at 3 weeks was seen in transcortical sensory aphasia, followed by isolation, conduction, and Wernicke type of aphasia. Patients with global aphasia had the poorest outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-Up at 6 Months</title><p>At 6 months, ANELT and Coeff were similar in the two study groups (table 2). The number of non-study SLT sessions after day 21 was 15 (4–38) in the treatment group and 10 (5–20) in the control group (p = 0.3).</p><p>ANELT at 6 months of follow-up was 4.5 (1.9–5.0) among those with an education of &gt;12 years and 1.5 (1.0–3.6) among those with less education (p &lt; 0.01). For Coeff at 6 months, the corresponding results were 57 (39–59) and 39 (17–55) (p &lt; 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Subgroup Analyses, Responders versus Non-Responders</title><p>These analyses were performed post hoc. Results in the 53 aphasic stroke patients who improved ≥1 on ANELT (i.e. an improvement which was predetermined to be clinically relevant; responders) are presented in table 3. The 34 responders in the SLT treatment group were compared to those 25 patients who improved &lt;1 on ANELT (non-responders). NIHSS at baseline was lower in the responder group than in the non-responder group [5 (2–12) vs. 11 (7–20); p &lt; 0.01]. Aphasia tests showed no difference at baseline except for fluency, which was 37 (30–64) words/min in the responder group and 8 (1.5–30) words/min in the non-responder group (p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in types of aphasia. The responders improved in all three parts of the NGA (comprehension, naming, and repetition), as compared to the non-responders (all p &lt; 0.01). At 6 months of follow-up, a difference in ANELT remained between responders and non-responders [2.7 (1.2–4.9) vs. 1.1 (0.8–1.6); p &lt; 0.01]. Among those with a fluency of &gt;30 words/min (n = 51), more patients improved &gt;1 on ANELT in the intervention group than among controls (18 vs. 6 patients; p &lt; 0.05).</p></sec></sec>\n",

However, no programs have analyzed their usefulness for patients with low literacy. We compared the efficacy of a heart failure self-management program designed for patients with low literacy versus usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a 12-month randomized controlled trial. From November 2001 to April 2003, we enrolled participants aged 30–80, who had heart failure and took furosemide. Intervention patients received education on self-care emphasizing daily weight measurement, diuretic dose self-adjustment, and symptom recognition and response. Picture-based educational materials, a digital scale, and scheduled telephone follow-up were provided to reinforce adherence. Control patients received a generic heart failure brochure and usual care. Primary outcomes were combined hospitalization or death, and heart failure-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>123 patients (64 control, 59 intervention) participated; 41% had inadequate literacy.

The primary outcome was complete or partial lesion clearance and the secondary outcome was safety of CPA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Although complete AK lesion clearance was not seen in this study, a significant reduction in the mean change from baseline in the average lesion area was observed at weeks 3 ( P=0.002), 6 (P&lt;0.001), and 12 (P&lt;0.001) in the CPA group, but only at weeks 6 and 12 in the placebo group (P=0.005 and P=0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the proportion of participants with a $10% decrease in average lesion area was significantly higher in the CPA group than the placebo group at weeks 3 (P=0.05) and 6 (P=0.02), and showed a trend at week 12 (P=0.06). A subset analysis of the change in average lesion area based upon the total lesion area at baseline revealed that CPA elicited a greater reduction than placebo (2×) in participants with a baseline total AK lesion area of 100–500 mm2 than in participants with a total area &lt;100 mm2 (1.3×).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study and previous in vitro studies suggest a potential role for CPA in the treatment of AK lesions and the prevention of SCC development.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participant disposition</title><p>Forty-five eligible subjects (four male and 41 female) were randomized and 42 completed the study (Figure 1). Three of the 45 participants did not complete the entire treatment period because of loss to follow-up (N=1) or AEs (N=2) (Figure 1). All enrolled participants were white Hispanic except for one participant of Asian ethnicity. Participants ranged from 45 to 82 years of age and the mean age of those on CPA was 60.0±10.8 years and those on placebo 55.7±9.1 years (Table 1). All study participants had mild AK lesions and two participants in the CPA group had two moderate lesions along with mild lesions. There was no difference in body mass index, average AK lesion area or total lesion area between the treatment groups at baseline (Table 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy of CPA</title><p>Although none of the study participants achieved complete clearance, decreases in average lesion area were seen with both CPA and placebo treatment (Figure 2). The CPA group showed almost twice the decrease in lesion size as the placebo group (Figure 3). The reduction was significant for both CPA and placebo groups at 6 (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.005, respectively) and 12 weeks (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.002, respectively), but only significant in the CPA group at 3 weeks (P=0.002). The difference in the week 6 change between the CPA and placebo groups approached statistical significance ( P=0.09). There was a decrease in average lesion area from week 12 to week 36 (post-treatment) in the CPA group (week 36 assessment was not performed in the placebo group), indicating that the improvement in the CPA group persisted beyond the treatment period (Figures 2 and 3). In the two participants with moderate lesions in the CPA group, lesions decreased to mild in severity at week 6, week 12, and follow-up at week 36.</p><p>A greater proportion of participants in the CPA group than the placebo group showed a &gt;10% decrease in average lesion size at week 3 (P=0.05) and week 6 (P=0.02) and showed a trend toward significance at week 12 ( P=0.06) (Figure 4). No difference was seen between the groups in the proportion of participants with&gt;25% reduction in the average lesion size, but &gt;50% reductions were observed only in the CPA group (Figure 4).</p><p>Subset analyses based upon the baseline total lesion area (&lt;100 mm2, 100–249 mm2 and 250–499 mm2) showed differences in treatment response within certain total lesion size groups. Participants in the CPA group with a total lesion area &lt;100 mm2 demonstrated a 1.3× greater mean reduction in average lesion size than placebo (data not shown). Similarly, greater responses were observed for participants in the CPA group compared to placebo for total lesion areas 101–250 mm2 (1.9× reduction) and 251–500 mm 2 (2.0× reduction). The CPA group showed a trend toward higher prevalence of lesion scabbing, a sign of healing, after 12 weeks of treatment (6.8%) than those treated with placebo (1.3%, P=0.09). An analysis of lesion age on responsiveness to treatment suggests that CPA and placebo had comparable reductions in the average lesion area. Although these differences were not statistically significant, the number of years since lesion onset was found to influence the extent of lesion resolution. Average lesion area was examined for participants with lesion onset of ≤5 years, 5–10 years, ≤10 years, and &gt;10 years. Greater reductions in lesion size were seen in the CPA group than the placebo group for all subsets and was found to be more pronounced in participants with lesion onset ≤10 years compared to those with onset &gt;10 years (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety analysis</title><p>One serious adverse event, a parasitic amoeba infection was reported during this study in a participant receiving placebo. A total of 56 AEs (45 CPA, eleven placebo) were reported in 30 (20 CPA, ten placebo) out of the 45 participants in the safety population (30 CPA, 15 placebo). There were ten events (nine CPA, one placebo) among four participants (three CPA, one placebo) that were judged by the principal investigator to be probably or possibly related to the study product. Of these, five were skin-related, and the other five were eye, gastrointestinal, general, immune, and vascular disorders. The skin-related disorders occurred in three participants, two in the CPA group, and one in the placebo group. This difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>Blood pressure was significantly reduced compared to baseline by a mean of 7.8 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (P=0.01) and a mean of 4.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (P&lt;0.001) after 6 weeks of treatment with CPA. These changes were not clinically significant. No between-group differences were noted for heart rate, blood pressure or safety laboratory parameters with the exception of sodium concentration and red blood cell count. Sodium and red blood cell count were both significantly decreased in the CPA group as compared to the placebo group (P=0.02 and  P=0.03, respectively). However, these changes were of small magnitude and not clinically important. No safety concerns were raised throughout the course of this study.</p></sec></sec>\n",

Those 458 that participated were invited to complete the follow-up measure and 402 of them did so (88%). There was no selective dropout regarding gender (χ2 (1, N = 458) = 0.3, p = .57), level of education (χ2 = 5.0, p = .08), or Hepatitis knowledge at baseline (t(456) = 1.83, p = .07). Furthermore, dropout did not differ between the two conditions (χ2 (1, N = 458) = 3.2, p = .08).

Figure 5 illustrates the final structural equation model testing the associations between user perceptions and website use across conditions, because there were no differences on both measures of website use. The final model is mostly in line with Hypothesis 2: Efficiency (M = 6.5, SD = 0.84), effectiveness (M = 6.4, SD = 0.87), and enjoyment (M = 5.6, SD = 1.21) were positively associated with website use and these associations were partly mediated by active trust (M = 5.8, SD = 1.23). The association between efficiency and website use, however, was fully mediated by active trust. Since there were no differences between conditions in terms of website use, there is neither support for Hypothesis 3a nor for Hypothesis 3b. Interest (M = 5.9, SD = 1.06), however, was positively associated with and contributed to explaining variance in website use besides efficiency, effectiveness, enjoyment, and active trust. The explained variance (R2) of the number of pages visited and time on the website is .63 and .51 respectively. The CFI and TLI are .98 and .97, respectively; RMSEA and SRMR are .06 and .04, respectively.

As the sitagliptin clinical development program continues, additional studies with sitagliptin have been completed. The present analysis updates the safety and tolerability assessment of sitagliptin by examining pooled data from 25 double-blind clinical studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The present analysis included data from 14,611 patients in 25 studies with T2DM who received either sitagliptin 100 mg/day (n = 7,726; sitagliptin group) or a comparator agent (n = 6,885; non-exposed group). These studies represent all randomized, double-blind trials conducted by Merck that included patients treated with the usual clinical dose of sitagliptin (100 mg/day) for between 12 weeks and 2 years, and for which results were available as of December 2011. These studies assessed sitagliptin, versus comparator agents, taken as monotherapy, initial combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, or as add-on combination therapy with other antihyperglycemic agents (metformin, pioglitazone, a sulfonylurea ± metformin, insulin ± metformin, or metformin + pioglitazone or rosiglitazone).

Incidence rates of specific AEs were generally similar between the two groups, except for higher incidence rates of hypoglycemia related to the greater use of a sulfonylurea and diarrhea related to the greater use of metformin in the non-exposed group, and of constipation in the sitagliptin group. Treatment with sitagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancy, or pancreatitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this updated pooled safety analysis of data from 14,611 patients with T2DM, sitagliptin 100 mg/day was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 2 years in duration.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title>\n",

The between-group difference in the incidence rates of adverse events in the Metabolism and nutrition disorders SOC was primarily due to a higher incidence rate of hypoglycemia in the non-exposed group. The between-group difference in the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC was related to a higher incidence rate in the sitagliptin group for non-malignant adverse events within the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC, and was not the result of an imbalance in any single adverse event or any group of biologically related adverse events. The incidence rates of malignancy were similar for the two groups: 0.90 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin group and 0.93 per 100 patient-years in the non-exposed group [between-group difference of −0.05 (95% CI −0.41, 0.30)].

      "<sec><title>Hypoglycemia</title><p>The incidence rates of hypoglycemia were based on symptomatic reports of hypoglycemia, regardless of a concurrent glucose measurement. The predefined analysis for hypoglycemia (i.e., excluding data after initiation of glycemic rescue therapy) showed a between-group difference of −6.2 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI −7.6, −5.0), favoring the sitagliptin group. The difference observed for hypoglycemia was mainly due to the use of a sulfonylurea as a comparator agent in three studies of up to 2 years in duration, as well as a study in which patients were switched from placebo to a sulfonylurea during a double-blind continuation period (P020 in Table 6 in Appendix). Results from some individual studies included in this pooled analysis (in which sitagliptin was added to either a sulfonylurea with or without metformin or to insulin with or without metformin) demonstrated an increased risk for hypoglycemia with sitagliptin used in combination with these agents relative to placebo. In a separate pooled analysis of hypoglycemia in which confounding effects of a sulfonylurea or insulin as either background or comparator therapies were removed, the incidence rates of hypoglycemia were 5.6 and 5.1 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin (n = 5,956) and non-exposed (n = 5,122) groups, respectively, with a between-group difference of 0.5 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI −0.7, 1.6).</p></sec><sec><title>GI Symptoms</title><p>The primary analysis of select GI adverse events demonstrated similar incidence rates for the pooled select GI terms, the composite of abdominal pain terms, nausea, and vomiting (Table 4).

For the specific adverse event of diarrhea, a lower incidence was observed in the sitagliptin group. The differences observed for diarrhea mainly reflected the use of metformin as a comparator; when the confounding effects of initiation of metformin were removed, the incidence rates were 4.3 and 4.9 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin (n = 5,940) and non-exposed (n = 5,122) groups, respectively.<table-wrap><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Summary of composite adverse events/adverse events of interest</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>System organ class</th><th>Incidence rate per 100 patient-yearsa</th></tr><tr><th>Sitagliptin 100 mg</th><th>Non-exposed</th><th>Difference between sitagliptin and non-exposed (95% CI)b</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Acute renal failure (narrow SMQ)</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.0 (−0.1, 0.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Acute renal failure (broad SMQ)</td><td>2.1</td><td>1.6</td><td>0.4 (−0.1, 0.9)</td></tr><tr><td>Atrial fibrillation/flutter</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.2 (−0.0, 0.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Bronchitis</td><td>4.0</td><td>3.5</td><td>0.5 (−0.2, 1.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Gastrointestinal adverse event composite</td><td>14.6</td><td>15.6</td><td>−0.5 (−2.0, 1.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Abdominal pain composite</td><td>3.7</td><td>4.0</td><td>−0.3 (−1.1, 0.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Constipation</td><td>2.3</td><td>1.8</td><td>0.6 (0.0, 1.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Diarrhea</td><td>6.6</td><td>8.4</td><td>−1.4 (−2.5, −0.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Nausea</td><td>2.8</td><td>3.2</td><td>−0.2 (−0.9, 0.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Vomiting</td><td>1.8</td><td>1.6</td><td>0.3 (−0.2, 0.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Pancreatitis</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>−0.0 (−0.2, 0.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Pancreatitis (including chronic pancreatitis)</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.0 (−0.1, 0.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Proteinuria</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.1 (−0.2, 0.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Pneumonia</td><td>0.9</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.2 (−0.2, 0.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Rash</td><td>1.7</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.6 (0.2, 1.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Upper respiratory infection</td><td>8.2</td><td>8.9</td><td>−0.6 (−1.7, 0.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Urinary tract infection</td><td>4.4</td><td>4.8</td><td>−0.3 (−1.1, 0.4)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SMQ standardized MedDRA queries </p><p>a100 × (number of patients with ≥1 event/person years of follow-up time)</p><p>bBetween-group difference and 95% CI based on stratified analysis.

Low incidence rates of a wide range of specific malignancies were reported, with similar rates in both treatment groups; the 95% CI did not exclude zero for any of the specific malignancies that were reported. The most common malignancies observed were basal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer (Table 8 in Appendix). Analyses were performed for the pool of terms representing the category of pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma of pancreas, pancreatic carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma metastatic). The exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the pooled terms related to the category of pancreatic cancer were similar in the two treatment groups (0.05 and 0.06 events per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively). The number of adverse events (three in each group) was below the pre-defined threshold for calculating a 95% CI.</p><p>The incidence rate of adverse events in the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC overall was 2.03 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin group and 1.52 per 100 patient-years in the non-exposed group [between-group difference of 0.52 (95% CI 0.03, 1.01)]. The higher rate in the sitagliptin group was related to a higher rate of non-malignant neoplasms in the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC [incidence rates of 1.18 and 0.60 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively; between-group difference of 0.60 (95% CI 0.25, 0.96)]. This difference was not the result of an imbalance in any single adverse event or any group of biologically related adverse events. The most common non-malignant neoplasm adverse event terms observed were uterine leiomyoma/leiomyoma, lipoma, and skin papilloma. The only term for which the 95% CI around the between-group difference excluded zero was lipoma [between-group difference 0.15 (95% CI 0.02, 0.29)]. A sensitivity analysis, performed to assess the incidence of non-malignant neoplasms across any SOC, revealed a similar pattern, with incidences of 1.58 and 1.12 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively [between-group difference of 0.45 (95% CI 0.02, 0.89)]; in this sensitivity analysis, the adverse event term “colonic polyp” was the most common, with similar incidences in the two treatment groups (0.25 and 0.26 per 100-patient years, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Angioedema</title><p>At baseline, 29.4% and 28.1% of sitagliptin-treated and non-exposed patients, respectively, were treated with ACE inhibitors.

For those adverse events in which the between-group difference was ≥0.5 events per 100 patient-years, there were two (constipation and dyspepsia) and seven (diarrhea, fatigue, edema peripheral, blood glucose decreased, hypoglycemia, blood glucose increased, and weight increased) in which the incidences were higher in the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively.

The patients were similar among the 3 groups, had diarrhea for 50–64 hours prior to admission, and were dehydrated when admitted to the unit for study. Half of the patients in each group were well nourished and the others had mild to moderate degrees of malnutrition. Rotavirus infection was the agent causing the illness in 63% of the patients. The infants fed juice ingested 14–17% more calories than those given WA, (those receiving AJ and WGJ ingested 95 and 98 Calories/Kg/d respectively) whereas those receiving WA consumed 81 cal/kg/d). The increased energy intake was not at the expense of other foods or milk formula. The mean body weight gain was greater among patients receiving WGJ (+ 50.7 gm) as compared with the patients in the AJ group (+ 18.3 gm) or the patients fed WA (- 0.7 gm) (p = 0.08). The duration of the illness was longer in the infants fed juice as compared with those given WA (p = 0.006), the mean +/- SD duration in hours was 49.4 ± 32.6, 47.5 ± 38.9 and 26.5 ± 27.4 in patients fed AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. All patients improved while ingesting juice and none of them developed persistent diarrhea; most recovered within 50 hours of the beginning of treatment and less than one fourth had diarrhea longer than 96 hours in the unit. The fecal losses were also increased among the juice fed patients (p = 0.001); the mean ± SD fecal excretion in g/kg/h was 3.94 ± 2.35, 3.59 ± 2.35, and 2.19 ± 1.63 in AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. The stool output was highest during the first day of treatment among all the patients, though those fed AJ had the highest volume of fecal losses and those who received WA had the lowest stool excretion. After the first day of treatment the differences in fecal excretion were not significant. The ability to tolerate carbohydrates during the illness and immediately after recovery was similar among the 3 groups of patients. Intake of juices with different fructose/glucose ratios and osmolarities resulted in more fecal losses and more prolonged diarrhea as compared with water feedings, but the patients given juice ingested more calories and gained more weight, particularly among those being fed the juice with equimolar concentrations of fructose and glucose.</p></abstract><title>Results</title><p>The clinical characteristics and the laboratory data of the patients on admission are shown in tables 2 and 3. The patients in each of the 3 groups were similar in age, duration and severity of diarrhea, presence of fever and vomiting. Also there were no differences in the proportion of patients who received breast feedings or in their nutritional status. Over 46% of patients studied in each group, were well nourished, more than 33% showed mild body weight deficits (&lt;1 SD) and the others had mild to moderate malnutrition (&gt;2 SD). All patients presented some dehydration (mild to moderate), and required no intravenous hydration therapy.

In adults, the clinical severity of AD has been associated with increases in T helper cell type (Th) 2, Th22, and Th17 serum markers, including high levels of CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 17 and CCL22 chemokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To explore the possible association between serum chemokine levels and AD severity in infants with moderate-to-severe AD and elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE).</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>Serum samples ( n = 41) obtained from a randomized, double-blind, and clinical dietary intervention study were used to study biomarkers in infants with AD. Baseline- and post-intervention samples (4 months) were used, six chemokines and nine ratios thereof were analyzed using Luminex and correlated to AD severity. In the initial study, the infants were randomized to receive extensively hydrolyzed whey-based formula without (control) or with short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides/long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (9:1) and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V (active).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>31 Infants up to 11 months of age, with an objective-SCORAD score (oSCORAD) ≥ 20 and elevated total-IgE and/or specific-IgE levels were included. In time, the median oSCORAD decreased in both groups by −8 (control, p  &lt; 0.05; active, p  &lt; 0.01). Irrespective of dietary intervention, several changes in Th2 chemokines (CCL17 and CCL22), inflammatory chemokine (CCL20), and the Th1 chemokine, CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 9, were detected over time. Overall CCL17 correlated to oSCORAD ( r = 0.446, p  &lt; 0.01). After 4 months of dietary intervention, CXCL9 was higher ( p  &lt; 0.01) in the active group compared with control [active, 2.33 (1.99–2.89); controls, 1.95 (1.77–2.43) log 10 median (range)]. In addition, a reduction in Th2/Th1 chemokine ratios for CCL17/CXCL9, CCL22/CXCL9, CCL20/CXCL10, and CCL20/CXCL11 was detected associated with the active intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While this study is small and exploratory in nature, these data contribute to immune biomarker profiling and understanding of AD in infants.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Infant Characteristics</title><p>Overall, 53 infants with moderate-to-severe AD were screened.

      "<abstract><title>Background</title><p>The safety of the immune complexes composed of yeast-derived hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies (abbreviated as YIC) among healthy adults and chronic hepatitis B patients has been proved in phase I and phase IIa trial. A larger number of patients for study of dosage and efficacy are therefore needed.</p><sec><title>Methods and Principal Findings</title><p>Two hundred forty two HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients were immunized with six injections of either 30 µg YIC, 60 µg of YIC or alum adjuvant as placebo at four-week intervals under code. HBV markers and HBV DNA were monitored during immunization and 24 weeks after the completion of immunization. The primary endpoint was defined as loss of HBeAg, or presence of anti-HBe antibody or suppression of HBV DNA, while the secondary endpoint was both HBeAg seroconversion and suppression of HBV DNA. Statistical significance was not reached in primary endpoints four weeks after the end of treatment among three groups, however, at the end of follow-up, HBeAg sero-conversion rate was 21.8%(17/78) and 9% (7/78) in the 60 µg YIC and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.03), with 95% confidence intervals at 1.5% to 24.1%. Using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) model, a significant difference of group effects was found between 60 µg YIC and the placebo groups in terms of the primary endpoint. Eleven serious adverse events occurred, which were 5.1%, 3.6%, and 5.0% in the placebo, 30 µg YIC and 60 µg YIC groups respectively (p&gt;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Though statistical differences in the preset primary and secondary endpoints among the three groups were not reached, a late and promising HBeAg seroconversion effect was shown in the 60 µg YIC immunized regimen. By increasing the number of patients and injections, the therapeutic efficacy of YIC in chronic hepatitis B patients will be further evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ChiCTR.org <ext-link>ChiCTR-TRC-00000022</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients</title><p>Three hundred and fifty four hepatitis B patients were evaluated for the inclusion criteria.

      "<p>At the 2-year follow-up, there were no subjects “at risk” in the trabecular metal group (0/28). At the 5-year follow-up, none of the trabecular metal components were found to be “at risk”. At the 2-year follow-up, there were 4 subjects “at risk” in the cemented group (4/21). At the 5-year follow-up, 1 of the cemented components “at risk” was lost to follow-up, 2 stabilized (0.09 mm and 0.07 mm of movement between 2 and 5 years) and 1 continued to migrate (0.35 mm of movement between 2 and 5 years). 1 of the cemented implants found to be stable at 2 years migrated an additional 0.42 mm and was classified as being “at risk”. However, retrospectively, this implant had somewhat anomalous 2-year data (0.64 mm, 0.45 mm, and 0.87 mm at 1, 2, and 5 years), where the difference between 1 year and 5 years would make the implant appear stable (0.23 mm in 4 years) but the difference between 2 years and 5 years would make the implant appear to be continuously migrating (0.42 mm in 3 years). The condition number and mean errors for this subject were within normal limits. All other implants that were found to be stable at 2 years migrated less than 0.3 mm between the 2- and 5-year follow-up, and were still classified as stable. The proportion of “at risk” components at 5 years was 2 of 18 (0.11, 95% CI: 0.03–0.33) in the cemented group and was 0 of 27 (95% CI: 0.0–0.13) in the trabecular metal group (p = 0.2).</p><p>At the 5-year follow-up, there was no difference in MTPM between the cemented group and the trabecular metal group (p = 0.9) (Table 2 and Figure 2).

Participants (n=228) were recruited after completing a 6-month lifestyle telephone coaching program: mean age = 53.4 (standard deviation (SD)=12.3) years; 66.7% (152/228) female; mean body mass index (BMI) upon entering GHSH=29.5 kg/m2 (SD = 6.0). Participants received tailored text messages over a 6-month period. The message frequency, timing, and content of the messages was based on participant preference, ascertained during two tailoring telephone calls. Primary outcomes of body weight, waist circumference, physical activity (walking, moderate, and vigorous sessions/week), and dietary behaviors (fruit and vegetable serves/day, cups of sweetened drinks per day, takeaway meals per week; fat, fiber and total indices from the Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire) were assessed via self-report before (baseline) and after (6-months) extended contact (with moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) also assessed via accelerometry).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Significant intervention effects, all favoring the intervention group, were observed at 6-months for change in weight (-1.35 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.24, -0.46, P=.003), weekly moderate physical activity sessions (0.56 sessions/week, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.96, P=.008) and accelerometer-assessed MVPA (24.16 minutes/week, 95% CI: 5.07, 43.25, P=.007).

During the initial tailoring call, 40% (46/111) of participants requested fortnightly goal checks for both behavioral goals; 35% (40/111) weekly for both goals; and, 22%(25/111) weekly for one goal and fortnightly for the other goal. Approximately one-half the participants (58/111, 52%) did not request any real-time behavioral prompts and 35% (39/111) requested between 2-4 prompts per fortnight. Almost all (89/95, 94%) intervention participants still enrolled at 12-weeks completed the 12-week tailoring interview. During the 12-week tailoring call, almost all (82/89, 92%) participants changed their preference for text message content, and 40% (36/89) changed their preferred text message schedule. Outside of the 12-week tailoring call, only 3% (3/90) of participants changed either of these preferences via text.

Follow-up interviews with 62 intervention participants revealed that: experience with text messaging prior to GHSH impacted on participants’ experience during the intervention; the GHSH program often exceeded participants’ expectations; and participants generally perceived the GHS and GHSH intervention to be one program. Reasons for liking GHSH focused on: the reminders provided by the text messages to reinforce what participants wanted to do; maintaining accountability; and increased awareness of behaviors in real time. The few participants who did not like aspects of the GHSH nominated text messages being too repetitive or automated as key reasons.</p></sec><sec><title>Costs of Intervention Delivery Results</title><p>Health coach staff spent, on average, 35 minutes per participant conducting and preparing for the initial tailoring interview and 30 minutes for the 12-week tailoring interview. Research staff spent on average 31 minutes per participant entering tailoring data into the software following the initial tailoring call and 15 minutes per participant after the 12-week tailoring call. Research staff had to manually trigger responses to 813 goal check replies not recognized by the software (813/2071, 39%) of responses received), which took approximately 1 minute per response. During the intervention, 8518 text messages were sent to participants (at AU$0.15 each) totaling AU$1278 (averaging AU$11.21 per participant).

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, as a consequence of preterm birth, is a major cause of early mortality and morbidity. The withdrawal of progesterone, either actual or functional, is thought to be an antecedent to the onset of labour. There remains limited information on clinically relevant health outcomes as to whether vaginal progesterone may be of benefit for pregnant women with a history of a previous preterm birth, who are at high risk of a recurrence. Our primary aim was to assess whether the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries in women with a history of previous spontaneous preterm birth reduced the risk and severity of respiratory distress syndrome in their infants, with secondary aims of examining the effects on other neonatal morbidities and maternal health and assessing the adverse effects of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Women with a live singleton or twin pregnancy between 18 to &lt;24 weeks’ gestation and a history of prior preterm birth at less than 37 weeks’ gestation in the preceding pregnancy, where labour occurred spontaneously or in association with cervical incompetence or following preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, were eligible. Women were recruited from 39 Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian maternity hospitals and assigned by randomisation to vaginal progesterone pessaries (equivalent to 100 mg vaginal progesterone) (n = 398) or placebo (n = 389). Participants and investigators were masked to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was respiratory distress syndrome and severity. Secondary outcomes were other respiratory morbidities; other adverse neonatal outcomes; adverse outcomes for the woman, especially related to preterm birth; and side effects of progesterone treatment. Data were analysed for all the 787 women (100%) randomised and their 799 infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Most women used their allocated study treatment (740 women, 94.0%), with median use similar for both study groups (51.0 days, interquartile range [IQR] 28.0–69.0, in the progesterone group versus 52.0 days, IQR 27.0–76.0, in the placebo group). The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was similar in both study groups—10.5% (42/402) in the progesterone group and 10.6% (41/388) in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–1.49, p = 0.912)—as was the severity of any neonatal respiratory disease (adjusted treatment effect 1.02, 95% CI 0.69–1.53, p = 0.905). No differences were seen between study groups for other respiratory morbidities and adverse infant outcomes, including serious infant composite outcome (155/406 [38.2%] in the progesterone group and 152/393 [38.7%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82–1.17, p = 0.798). The proportion of infants born before 37 weeks’ gestation was similar in both study groups (148/406 [36.5%] in the progesterone group and 146/393 [37.2%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81–1.17, p = 0.765). A similar proportion of women in both study groups had maternal morbidities, especially those related to preterm birth, or experienced side effects of treatment. In 9.9% (39/394) of the women in the progesterone group and 7.3% (28/382) of the women in the placebo group, treatment was stopped because of side effects (adjusted RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.85–2.15, p = 0.204). The main limitation of the study was that almost 9% of the women did not start the medication or forgot to use it 3 or more times a week.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results do not support the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries in women with a history of a previous spontaneous preterm birth to reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or other neonatal and maternal morbidities related to preterm birth. Individual participant data meta-analysis of the relevant trials may identify specific women for whom vaginal progesterone might be of benefit.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Clinical Trials <ext-link>ISRCTN20269066</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Baseline information</title><p>Of an estimated 1,919 eligible women able to be approached by the research team between February 2006 and September 2012, a total of 787 (41%) women consented to be enrolled in the study. Reasons for eligible women declining to participate included ‘not interested in research’ (25%), ‘concerned about side effects and risks of use of drugs in pregnancy’ (15%), ‘no reason given’ (13%), ‘did not like the need to use vaginal pessaries’ (9%), ‘too busy’ (8%), ‘did not consider themselves to be at risk of preterm birth’ (6%), ‘partner declined to let them participate’ (5), and ‘other’ (19%).</p><p>Of the 787 women recruited, 398 (50.6%) were randomised to the progesterone group, and 389 (49.4%) to the placebo group.

Almost all women recruited in both study groups used their allocated study treatment (381 [95.7%] in the progesterone group and 359 [92.3%] in the placebo group), with similar median days of use in both study groups (51.0 days [interquartile range (IQR) 28.0–69.0] in the progesterone group versus 52.0 days [IQR 27.0–76.0] in the placebo group) (Table 1).</p>\n",

At baseline, patients’ characteristics in the 2 groups were similar (Table 1). Educational courses took place between October and December 2011, April and July 2012, August-December 2012. The follow-up of participants from both groups took place between 1st October 2011 and 20 th February 2013. The reasons for this slight delay in scheduled courses and follow-ups were that due to political events in Mali during 2012 we had to post pone the second and third education session courses in the intervention arm, and the corresponding follow-ups (February 2012, July 2012, January 2013). The patterns of withdrawal are documented in Fig 1. Overall, the 5 PEs facilitated 177 educational sessions with a mean of 6.4 patients per group session in the intervention group.

The decrease in HbA1c levels was more important in the intervention group, especially after month 6. Similarly, the evolution of BMI and WC was more favourable in the intervention group than in the control group (p = 0.001 for BMI and WC; Fig 3). Patients’ knowledge scores improved slightly, mostly due to their increased knowledge of symptoms, treatment and hypoglycaemia management (Table 4). No positive change in the diet diversity score as a crude index of diet quality was recorded in intervention patients. The number of meals remained the same. However, qualitative changes in the diet were noted from dietary recalls at baseline and at the end of follow-up in the various meals and snacks eaten during the day: meat and fish, as well as peanut and onion sauce, consumption was more abundant at baseline, the number of patients who mentioned having a morning snack decreased by more than half at follow-up,</p><fig><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0191262.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Evolution of HbA1c levels between baseline and 12 months–levels in % and 95% confidence interval.</title></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><fig><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0191262.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Evolution of body mass index, waist circumference and blood pressure between baseline and 12 months– 95% confidence interval.</title></caption><graphic></graphic></fig>\n",

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cigarette smoke contains free radicals and an have adverse effect to the immune system. Supplementation of palm oil vitamin E (palmvitee), is known has antioxidant properties is thought to be beneficial for system immune protection against free radicals activity. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of palmvitee supplementation on immune response in smokers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study involved a group of smokers and nonsmokers who received 200 mg/day palmvitee and placebo for the control group. Blood samples were taken at 0, 12 and 24 weeks of supplementation. Plasma tocopherol and tocotrienol were determined by HPLC, lymphocyte proliferation by lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) and enumeration of lymphocytes T and B cells by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed by Mann–Whitney U-test for non-parametric data distribution and correlation among the variables was examined by Spearman.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Plasma tocopherol and tocotrienol were increased in vitamin E supplemented group as compared to placebo group. Urine cotinine levels and serum α1-antitrypsin were significantly higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Lymphocyte proliferation induced by PHA showed an increasing trend with palmvitee supplementation in both smokers and nonsmokers. Natural killer cells were decreased; CD4+ cells and B cells were increased in smokers compared to nonsmokers but were unaffected with vitamin E supplementation except in the percentage of B cells which were increased in nonsmokers supplemented palmvitee compared to placebo. CD4+/CD8+ ratio was increased in smokers compared to nonsmokers. The high TWBC count observed in smokers correlated with the increased CD4+ and B cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Smoking caused alterations in certain immune parameters and palmvitee supplementation tended to cause an increase in lymphocytes transformation test but had no effect on CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, NK cells and B cells except B cells percentage in nonsmokers.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Plasma total vitamin E level</title><p>There was no difference in total plasma vitamin E, tocopherol and tocotrienol levels in smokers and nonsmokers at the beginning of the study (Figure  1 &amp; Table  1). After palmvitee supplementation, both plasma tocopherol and tocotrienol concentration were increased in smokers and nonsmokers (p &lt; 0.05) starting from 12 weeks until the end of the experiment. Tocopherol concentration was higher in plasma as compared to tocotrienol. Urinary cotinine and serum α1-antitrypsin of smokers were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) compared to nonsmokers (Table  1) but no changes were observed with supplementation. Urinary cotinine levels were increased accordingly to the number of cigarettes per day (Table  2).</p><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Total plasma vitamin E concentration in smokers and nonsmokers.</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig>\n",

      "<p>Table  5 shows the baseline levels of white blood cells counts, lymphocytes and T-cell subsets in smokers and nonsmokers. Table  2 shows the baseline according the number of cigarettes smoked per day. When comparing immune parameters between smokers and nonsmokers, WBC counts was higher in smokers (n = 58) compared to nonsmokers (n = 56, p &lt; 0.01) and unaffected by palmvitee supplementation (Table  6). No difference in the total number and percentage of lymphocytes and CD3+ cells was observed before and after palmvitee supplementation (Table  6). In separated group; S3, total CD3+ cells (T cell) increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) compared to nonsmokers before supplementation (Table  2) and remained unchanged in palmvitee-supplemented group (Table  7). The percentage of B cells in smokers was higher compared to nonsmokers (p &lt; 0.0001) and also in S1 (p &lt; 0.005), S2 (p &lt; 0.0005) and S3 groups (p &lt; 0.005) (Table  2). After palmvitee supplementation, B cells percentage was significantly increased in nonsmokers at 24 weeks (p &lt; 0.05) but not in the smokers (Table  6). In S1 and S3 palmvitee-supplemented groups there was a trend of increment in B cells percentage. The increment was correlated at 12 (r = 0.98, 0.87) and 24 weeks (r = 0.98, 0.96) respectively.</p>\n",

The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly (28-day) seizure frequency for the 16-week double-blind treatment period in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with analyzable seizure data. Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50% seizure reduction, proportion of patients seizure free, and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, −38.2% (P = 0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and −42.9% (P = 0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg. Responder rates were 28.1%, 36.1% (P = 0.08), and 40.7% (P = 0.02); 16-week seizure-free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3%, 4.9% (P = 0.59), and 11.4% (P = 0.008), respectively. When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters, a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: −13.3%; 1200 mg: −34.5%, P = 0.02; 2400 mg: −52.7%, P = 0.006) in the North American study site cluster. A concentration–response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg. Adverse event types reflected the drug's established profile. Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate-release OXC. Once-daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adjunctive once-daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures. Adverse event occurrence and discontinuations due to adverse events suggest improved tolerability vs previously published data with immediate-release OXC.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title>\n",

Analyzable seizure data for the primary efficacy analysis were available for 96.7% (n = 117), 89.3% (n = 109), and 90.3% (n = 111), respectively (Fig. 1). Of the 111 patients in the 2400-mg group with analyzable seizure data, 26 were patients in whom SPN-804 was down-titrated to 1800 mg/day. Overall, 67.8% of patients completed 16 weeks, with 21.5% of placebo patients discontinuing prematurely compared with 32.8% and 42.3% in the 1200-mg and 2400-mg SPN-804 groups, respectively. The most common reason for study withdrawal was adverse events, accounting for the higher discontinuation rates in the active treatment groups.

The ‘Physical Activity 4 Everyone' (PA4E1) study tested a multi-component physical activity intervention in 10 secondary schools from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This paper aimed to report the secondary outcomes of the study; to determine whether the intervention impacted on adiposity outcomes (weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score), and whether any effect was moderated by sex, baseline BMI and baseline physical activity level, at 12 and 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>SUBJECTS/METHODS:</title><p>A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. The school-based intervention included seven physical activity strategies targeting the following: curriculum (strategies to maximise physical activity in physical education, student physical activity plans, an enhanced school sport programme); school environment (physical activity during school breaks, modification of school policy); and parents and the community (parent engagement, links with community physical activity providers). Students' weight (kg), BMI and BMI z-score, were collected at baseline (Grade 7), 12 and 24 months. Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between-group mean difference from baseline to 12 and 24 months. Exploratory sub-analyses were undertaken according to three moderators of energy balance.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 1150 students (mean age=12 years) provided outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91%) at 12 months and 985 (86%) at 24 months.

      "<abstract><p>We study whether exposure to poverty can induce affective states that decrease productivity. In a controlled laboratory setting, we find that subjects randomly assigned to a treatment, in which they view a video featuring individuals that live in extreme poverty, exhibit lower subsequent productivity compared to subjects assigned to a control treatment. Questionnaire responses, as well as facial recognition software, provide quantitative measures of the affective state evoked by the two treatments. Subjects exposed to images of poverty experience a more negative affective state than those in the control treatment. Further analysis shows that individuals in a more positive emotional state exhibit less of a treatment effect. Also, those who exhibit greater attentiveness upon viewing the poverty video are less productive. The results are consistent with the notion that exposure to poverty can induce a psychological state in individuals that adversely affects productivity.</p></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Performance</title><p>The measure of performance in our experiment is the number of sliders an individual correctly aligns over the course of a ten-period session. On average subjects solved 171.91 sliders with a standard deviation of 46.96 in a session. As illustrated in Fig 1, subjects in the Poverty treatment solved 165.2 sliders as compared to 179.3 sliders in the Neutral treatment. This difference is borderline significant (t(97,151) = 1.534, p = 0.063). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the hypothesis that the number of sliders completed in the two treatments are drawn from the same distribution (KS-test, p&lt;0.01). Performance in the Neutral treatment is significantly lower than that observed by [12], where subjects on average solved 222 sliders in 20 minutes. We attribute this difference to the fact that [12] employ tournament incentives that have been proven to increase effort [28].</p><fig><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0170231.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Average performance by treatment.</title></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><p>Furthermore, the treatment effect on performance is significant once other sources of variation are controlled for. We estimate a regression of performance on condition dummies, covariates of wealth, and previous exposure to poverty. The estimates of this linear regression are presented in Table 1. The table shows that the effect of being assigned to Poverty is significant once the variables that capture the subject’s previous exposure to poverty and wealth are included.

These patterns, coupled with the PANAS results, reveal that the Poverty video increases a number of negative emotions such as fear, guilt, sadness, shame and upset. Whether these differences in affects correlate with lower performance is addressed in the next section.</p><table-wrap><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0170231.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Changes in Physiological Measure of Emotions from Before to After the Video, both Treatments.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic></graphic><table><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Emotion</th><th>Poverty</th><th>Neutral</th><th>Difference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Neutral</td><td>-.0011</td><td>0.048</td><td>-.058</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.213)</td><td>(0.294)</td><td>(.066)</td></tr><tr><td>Happy</td><td>-.068</td><td>-0.051</td><td>.-017</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.125)</td><td>(0.122)</td><td>(.033)</td></tr><tr><td>Sad</td><td>0.037</td><td>-0.002</td><td>.039*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.098)</td><td>(0.077)</td><td>(.024)</td></tr><tr><td>Angry</td><td>0.002</td><td>-0.002</td><td>.004</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.091)</td><td>(0.062)</td><td>(.025)</td></tr><tr><td>Surprised</td><td>0.007</td><td>0.027</td><td>-.020</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.097)</td><td>(0.090)</td><td>(.022)</td></tr><tr><td>Scared</td><td>0.010</td><td>-0.006</td><td>.015**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.036)</td><td>(0.019)</td><td>(.008)</td></tr><tr><td>Disgusted</td><td>-0.003</td><td>-0.004</td><td>.001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.016)</td><td>(0.010)</td><td>(.003)</td></tr><tr><td>Valence</td><td>-0.111</td><td>-0.037</td><td>-.073*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.185)</td><td>(0.134)</td><td>(.045)</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>39</td><td>21</td><td>21</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Note: This table presents the difference in average intensity, between before and after the stimulus was presented to the subjects for the 7 emotions analyzed by the facereader software.

      "<abstract><p>Deficits in social cognition including facial affect recognition and their detrimental effects on functional outcome are well established in schizophrenia. Structured training can have substantial effects on social cognitive measures including facial affect recognition. Elucidating training effects on cortical mechanisms involved in facial affect recognition may identify causes of dysfunctional facial affect recognition in schizophrenia and foster remediation strategies. In the present study, 57 schizophrenia patients were randomly assigned to (a) computer-based facial affect training that focused on affect discrimination and working memory in 20 daily 1-hour sessions, (b) similarly intense, targeted cognitive training on auditory-verbal discrimination and working memory, or (c) treatment as usual. Neuromagnetic activity was measured before and after training during a dynamic facial affect recognition task (5 s videos showing human faces gradually changing from neutral to fear or to happy expressions). Effects on 10–13 Hz (alpha) power during the transition from neutral to emotional expressions were assessed via MEG based on previous findings that alpha power increase is related to facial affect recognition and is smaller in schizophrenia than in healthy subjects. Targeted affect training improved overt performance on the training tasks. Moreover, alpha power increase during the dynamic facial affect recognition task was larger after affect training than after treatment-as-usual, though similar to that after targeted perceptual–cognitive training, indicating somewhat nonspecific benefits. Alpha power modulation was unrelated to general neuropsychological test performance, which improved in all groups. Results suggest that specific neural processes supporting facial affect recognition, evident in oscillatory phenomena, are modifiable. This should be considered when developing remediation strategies targeting social cognition in schizophrenia.</p></abstract><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>Clinical statusimproved in all three SZ groups independent of type of intervention: general function (GAF  F (2,53) = 16.92,  p  &lt; .001), positive symptoms (PANSS-P  F (2,53) = 17.92,  p  &lt; .001), and general symptoms (PANSS-G  F (2,53) = 10.30,  p  &lt; .001; PANSS-N n.s.). There were no effects involving Intervention.</p><sec><label>3.1</label><title>MEG during FAR criterion task prior to intervention</title><p>Fig. 2illustrates time–frequency representation (TFR) of power during face morphing prior to intervention. The HC19 group TFR showed an increase from baseline in the 10–13 Hz range between 1 s (morph onset) and 3.5 s after stimulus onset, with maximum around 3 s. This increase was not evident in any SZ group. Statistical comparisons ( Fig. 2 , bottom) confirmed significant differences between HC19 and pre-intervention SZ in alpha-power increase over a central sensor cluster in the time course from 2.5 to 3.5 s after stimulus onset.</p><p>FAT task performancewas poorer in SZ during their first FAT session than in the HC24 group during their one FAT session (same-different task  F (1,41) = 7.69,  p = .008; blended emotion task  F (1,41) = 8.24,  p = .006; emotion sequence task  F (1,41) = 16.11,  p  &lt; .001; emotion location task  F (1,41) = 16.19,  p  &lt; .001;  Fig. 3 A). Performance improved with training on all four tasks in the FAT group, significantly in three tasks ( Fig. 3B , left): same/different,  F (1,18) = 4.99,  p = .04; blended emotion  F (1,18) = 10.17,  p = .005; emotion sequence  F (1,18) = 3.28,  p = .09; emotion location  F (1,18) = 13.12,  p = .002. In the last FAT training session, SZ no longer differed significantly from HC24 on three of the four tasks. SZ still performed worse in the emotion location task ( F (1,41) = 6.72,  p = .01; see also effect sizes in  Fig. 3B , right).</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>FAT impact on MEG during FAR criterion task</title><p>An Emotion × Time analysis of the FAT group produced a main effect of Time,  F (1,18) = 5.61,  p = .03 ( p = .02), reflecting a greater increase in alpha power from prestimulus baseline during the pre-recognition period of the FAR criterion task after training than before training ( Fig. 4 , left). Here and below, no effects involving Emotion emerged.</p><p>Pre-training, a Group (FAT pre-training vs. HC19) × Emotion analysis indicated smaller alpha power increase in SZ than in HC19 ( F (1,36) = 22.05,  p  &lt; .001;  Fig. 3 ). A similar comparison of FAT post-training vs. HC19 verified this effect (Group  F (1,36) = 5.73,  p = .02). Effect sizes indicated larger differences in alpha power modulation prior to FAT (fearful condition  g = 1.29, happy condition  g = 1.08) than after FAT (fearful condition  g = .66, happy condition  g = .58). Thus, dysfunctional oscillatory dynamics can be improved by FAT, though not to full normalization.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Specificity of intervention effects</title><p>Fig. 4illustrates the change in alpha power increase after intervention in the three patient groups. An Intervention (FAT vs. TAU) × Emotion × Time analysis produced a marginal effect of Time,  F (1,36) = 2.80,  p = .1 ( p  &gt; .1), reflecting some general improvement over time in the pooled sample, and an Intervention × Time interaction,  F (1,36) = 4.78,  p = .04 ( p = .05), reflecting improvement in the FAT group ( Fig. 4 , left) vs. a nonsignificant decline in the TAU group ( Fig. 4 , right). Thus, changes in alpha power modulation were specific to training. Here and below, no main effects of Intervention emerged. That was as anticipated, given random assignment to group, with group variance therefore expected only in Intervention × Time effects.</p><p>The final a priori ANOVA assessed whether this improvement in alpha response with active training was specific to FAT. An Intervention (FAT vs. CE) × Emotion × Time analysis produced an effect of Time,  F (1,36) = 8.54,  p = .006 ( p = .008), reflecting improvement with training, but no Intervention × Time interaction, indicating similar improvement in the two active treatment groups ( Fig. 4 ).</p></sec>\n",

Because the primary relevant hypothesis such an analysis addresses, that intervention improves brain function, is directional, a one-tailed test of the Time effect would be appropriate, or equivalently a  p = .10 criterion for the ANOVA effect. The Time effect exceeded that criterion,  F (1,54) = 4.81,  p = .03 ( p = .06), with alpha power increase from prestimulus baseline during the pre-recognition period of the FAR criterion task larger after training than before training. A secondary hypothesis that an omnibus test could address is that interventions differed in their impact, thus a nondirectional Intervention × Time effect, which was marginal,  F (2,54) = 2.44,  p  &lt; .10 ( p = .10).

MCCB performance generally improved after intervention (Time  F (1,54) = 28.45,  p  &lt; .001). A Domain × Time interaction ( F (6,324) = 4.05,  p = .001, HF = .91) reflected improvement in Processing Speed ( F (1,56) = 33.56,  p  &lt; .01), Attentional Vigilance ( F (1,56) = 15.82,  p  &lt; .01), and Visual Learning ( F (1,56) = 11.99,  p = .001) but not in Working Memory, Verbal Learning, Reasoning, or Social Cognition (see  Table 2 for normative  T -scores). There was a Time × Intervention effect,  F (2,54) = 3.70,  p = .03, resulting from significant performance improvement on Reasoning after CE,  t (18) = 2.06,  p = .05, not after FAT or TAU. There was no Time × Intervention × Domain effect ( F (12, 324) = 1.28,  p  &gt; .1). Thus, these improvements did not depend on type of treatment. Change in alpha power increase from baseline between pre- and post-intervention was not related to changes in neuropsychological test performance (MCCB) or in clinical status (symptom severity, GAF).</p></sec>\n",

Each subject received one eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours prior to a CAC. Primary ocular end points included changes in ocular itching reported at 3, 5, and 7 minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7, 15, and 20 minutes following each CAC.

A total of 237 patients were subsequently enrolled and assigned to treatment groups according to a computer-generated randomization code at visit 3A. A third treatment arm that was not included in this analysis of pooled data, BBOS 1.0%, accounted for 80 of these subjects and has been previously discussed.33,34 The remaining 157 subjects comprised the intent-to-treat population. Of these, 140 subjects completed the study without a significant protocol deviation, and thus this subgroup constituted the per protocol population.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy</title><sec><title>Ocular itching</title><p>For the PP population, the differences in mean ocular itching scores between the BBOS 1.5% and the placebo group were found to be statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) at all visits and time points by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and across all time points at a study visit by ANCOVA assessments (Table 3). In addition, the onset and 8-hour persistence-of-action measures were also clinically significant at all time points. A comparison of the difference between onset and 8-hour persistence-of-action scores shows that the treatment effect remained relatively constant over this time period (differences of 1.4–1.6 units at onset, and 1.3–1.5 units at 8 hours). Differences in mean ocular itching scores for BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo for the 16-hour persistence-of-action measures were also statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) at all time points; however, the range of differences did not reach ≥1.0 unit difference at a majority of time points, the standard prospectively designated as clinically significant.</p><p>Figure 2A shows the data for ocular itching scores by degree of resolution of itching (itching score =0), and demonstrates that more subjects in the BBOS 1.5% group compared to those in the placebo group experienced complete relief of CAC-induced ocular itching. BBOS 1.5% was statistically superior to placebo at all CAC visits. In addition, the majority of BBOS 1.5% subjects reported zero itching at the onset of action as early as 3 minutes after a CAC. Total itching relief was sustained at the 8-hour persistence-of-action visit for one-third of all subjects. In addition, a sizable number of subjects experienced complete relief from ocular itch even at the 16-hour persistence-of-action visit. </p><p>Figure 2B shows the proportion of severely allergic subjects (baseline [visit 2] ocular itching scores ≥3) who experienced complete resolution of CAC-induced ocular itching.

Numerical reduction in hyperemia scores was superior for BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo at almost all time points.

However, the criterion for clinical significance (≥1.0 unit reduction) was not met at any study visit. </p></sec><sec><title>Secondary efficacy variables</title><p>Consistent improvements in several secondary efficacy variables were seen with BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo. Data for ocular tearing were notable and are summarized in Table 5. The percentage of subjects exhibiting tearing in response to a CAC ranged from 23%–39% from onset of action to 16 hours after drug instillation in placebo-treated eyes compared to 6%–15% from onset of action up to 16 hours after drug instillation in BBOS 1.5%-treated eyes. This reduction was both statistically and clinically significant for all time points measured.</p><p>Additional end points, including ciliary and episcleral hyperemia, chemosis, and eyelid swelling, are summarized in Table 6. All measures showed improvement for BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo based upon reduced mean scores. In particular, all of the end points showed statistically significant reductions by BBOS 1.5% at the onset-of-action CAC test for either all time points (chemosis and eyelid swelling) or the majority of the assessed time points (ciliary and episcleral hyperemia), and the results for ciliary and episcleral hyperemia were very similar to those seen for conjunctival hyperemia.

Overall, there were a total of 24 AEs in the PP population reported for the BBOS 1.5% treatment group and ten AEs in the placebo treatment group (Table 7). AEs in the PP population were generally non-ocular and not considered related to the test agent. The most common non-ocular AEs included nasopharyngitis (n=3 for both treatment groups) and a mild taste upon instillation for the BBOS 1.5% treatment group (n=4). Among the few AEs that were ocular, the most commonly reported was eye irritation, which was seen in both the placebo (n=2) and BBOS 1.5% (n=3) treatment groups. In addition, visits throughout both CAC trials included an ocular examination by slit-lamp biomicroscopy for each subject, and there were no clinically significant findings reported in the course of these examinations.</p></sec></sec>\n",

      "<abstract><p>Our aim was to study the expression of adipokine-encoding genes (leptin, adiponectin, and angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4)) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and adipokine concentration in cord blood from women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) depending on glycaemic targets. GDM patients were randomised to 2 groups per target glycaemic levels: GDM1 (tight glycaemic targets, fasting blood glucose &lt; 5.1 mmol/L and &lt;7.0 mmol/L postprandial, N = 20) and GDM2 (less tight glycaemic targets, &lt;5.3 mmol/L and &lt; 7.8 mmol/L, respectively, N = 21). The control group included 25 women with normal glucose tolerance. ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; p &lt; 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2. The level of adiponectin gene expression was low and did not differ among the groups. Leptin gene expression was undetectable in HUVECs. In cord blood, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) was increased in GDM2 compared to controls and GDM1 ( p = 0.038) and did not differ between GDM1 and controls. Tight glycaemic targets were associated with normalisation of increased LAR in the cord blood. ANGPTL4 expression was downregulated in HUVECs of newborns from GDM mothers and was not affected by the intensity of glycaemic control.</p></abstract><sec><title>3. Results</title><sec><title>3.1. Characteristics of the Participants</title><p>Baseline characteristics of the participants are described in Table 1 . The women from all three groups did not differ in terms of age and prepregnancy BMI. The GDM1 group had higher diastolic BP compared to controls ( p = 0.003). The GDM1 and GDM2 groups had higher levels of fasting PG ( p = 0.004 and p = 0.003, resp.) and higher levels of PG 1 h and 2 h in OGTT ( p &lt; 0.001 in comparison with controls).</p><p>Mean levels of fasting, 1-hour postprandial and average blood glucose measured by the participants during the study are described in Table 2 . The GDM1 group achieved significantly lower average and 1-hour postprandial glucose levels compared to GDM2. Mean postprandial BG was lower in GDM1 even compared to the control group, though the difference did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.088). Gestational weight gain did not differ between GDM1 and GDM2 groups and was lower in both groups compared to controls ( Table 2 ). The percentage of women treated with insulin was 40% and 29% in the GDM1 and GDM2 groups, respectively, and did not significantly differ ( p = 0.495).</p></sec><sec><title>3.2. Pregnancy Outcomes</title><p>Pregnancy outcomes and biochemical markers in cord blood are shown in Table 3 .</p><p>There was no statistically significant difference among the groups in terms of pregnancy outcomes (percent of large for gestational age (LGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) newborns, delivery by caesarean section) and the level of C-peptide, adiponectin, and ANGPTL4 in cord blood serum and glucose in cord blood plasma. The level of leptin in cord blood serum was higher in the GDM2 group than in the GDM1 ( p = 0.036) and the control group, but the difference from the control group did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.066). After adjustment by insulin therapy, age, and prepregnancy BMI, the difference in the level of leptin between GDM1 and GDM2 remained significant ( p = 0.01). The leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) in cord blood serum was higher in the GDM2 group compared to controls ( p = 0.011) with no difference between the GDM1 and control group ( p = 0.404).</p></sec><sec><title>3.3. HUVEC Characterisation</title><p>HUVECs were obtained from the umbilical vein, expanded in vitro, and characterised for expression of endothelial markers by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. All samples demonstrated characteristic endothelial morphology and immunophenotype CD45−/CD144+/CD31+/CD146+/CD105+ and stained positively for endothelial markers, von Willebrand factor, and CD146 (as demonstrated in our previous work [ 20 ]). There was no difference in the parameters of viability and replicative aging of HUVEC cultures from different patient groups (data not presented).</p></sec><sec><title>3.4. Gene Expression in HUVECs</title><p>ANGPTL4 expression was downregulated in the HUVECs derived from GDM patients compared to control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 0.92, respectively, for GDM1, GDM2, and control groups; p &lt; 0.001 for comparison among the 3 groups) while no difference between GDM1 and GDM2 groups was observed ( Figure 1(a) ).</p><p>We did not detect the expression of LEP in HUVEC but found out that they expressed LEPR, and the expression of LEPR demonstrated a decline in the GDM1/GDM2 groups compared to the control group, though the differences were not statistically significant ( Figure 1(c) ). The expression of LEPR did not correlate with the level of LEP in cord plasma ( Figure 1(d) ) which indicates that there is no reciprocal regulation between LEP and its receptor in HUVECs. The expression of ADIPOQ was detected in HUVEC samples, but the level of its expression was as low as in negative control samples and lower by four orders of magnitude in HUVEC compared to adipocytes (positive control) ( Figure 1(b) ).</p></sec></sec>\n",

      "<sec><title>Group characteristics</title><p>Out of 44 subjects allocated to intervention, 40 subjects (19 men and 21 women) completed the study according to the protocol (full analysis set; FAS). Four subjects dropped out after start of supplementation and before efficacy testing. Three of these suffered from a common cold, which did not allow them to perform the exhaustive exercise test, and one dropped out due to personal decision.</p><p>Thirty-seven subjects were analyzed for valid case analysis set (VCAS). One subject had a strong common cold during the exhaustive exercise test, which may have influenced biomarker results. Another subject did not meet compliance criteria for study product intake and the third subject had major deviation of the exhaustive exercise protocol. As these three subjects did meet exclusion criteria for VCAS analysis, they were not considered in final analysis (VCAS).</p><p>Gender, age, BMI, blood routine markers, and blood pressure did not differ significantly between the groups prior to the study. Subject characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The nutrition frequency questionnaire scores were 45.35 ± 10.51 points in the lemon verbena group and 42.65 ± 11.33 points in the placebo group (p = 0.4597). Most subjects consumed between two and four portions fruits plus vegetables per day (lemon verbena: 82%, placebo: 70%). Intake of fruit and vegetables, as supplier for polyphenols, were comparable between groups. The protocol compliance of study product intake was very good. For VCAS, all subjects met the compliance criterion ≥85% and ≤115% of study preparation consumed (lemon verbena group: 102 ± 5%, placebo: 101 ± 2%). For FAS, one subject had a compliance &gt;115% since much less products remained, bringing up uncertainty about correct intake, which was the reason for exclusion from VCAS. Borg scale data after exhaustive exercise and jump repetitions were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.8997, p = 0.1561). Therefore, burden of subjects by the exhaustive exercise and jump protocol was comparable between groups, so a comparable stress could be expected.<table-wrap><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Subject characteristics at screening for FAS (N = 40, 19 men, 21 women)</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Parameter <break></break>[unit]</th><th></th><th>Lemon verbena <break></break>(N = 20 59% men, 41% women)</th><th>Placebo <break></break>(N = 20 40% men, 60% women)</th><th>Inclusion criteria/Reference range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age <break></break>[years]</td><td>Mean</td><td>31.7</td><td>30.6</td><td>22–50</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>8.8</td><td>9.3</td></tr><tr><td>BMI <break></break>[kg/m2]</td><td>Mean</td><td>22.67</td><td>23.0</td><td>19–30</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>2.3</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Activity <break></break>[MET min/week]</td><td>Mean</td><td>3209</td><td>2470.0</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>3957.0</td><td>2521</td></tr><tr><td>CHOL <break></break>[mg/dL]</td><td>Mean</td><td>172.5</td><td>180.0</td><td>100–200</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>23.0</td><td>31.85</td></tr><tr><td>TG <break></break>[mg/dL]</td><td>Mean</td><td>89.68</td><td>82.14</td><td>&lt;160</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>43.53</td><td>24.71</td></tr><tr><td>HDL <break></break>[mg/dL]</td><td>Mean</td><td>58.91</td><td>58.95</td><td>&gt;40</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>6.487</td><td>14.24</td></tr><tr><td>LDL <break></break>[mg/dL]</td><td>Mean</td><td>93.86</td><td>109.5</td><td>&lt;150</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>16.32</td><td>28.7</td></tr><tr><td>Glucose <break></break>[mg/dL]</td><td>Mean</td><td>87.55</td><td>86.14</td><td>60–100</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>8.405</td><td>4.96</td></tr><tr><td>SBP <break></break>[mmhg]</td><td>Mean</td><td>121.6</td><td>121.6</td><td>120–129</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>12.8</td><td>12.8</td></tr><tr><td>DBP <break></break>[mmhg]</td><td>Mean</td><td>75.8</td><td>70.6</td><td>80–84</td></tr><tr><td>Sd</td><td>8.8</td><td>10.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>BMI body mass index, MET metabolic equivalent of task, CHOL cholesterol, TG triglycerides, HDL high-density lipoprotein, LDL low-density lipoprotein, SBP systolic blood pressure, DBP diastolic blood pressure </p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec>\n",

The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR). Baseline patient characteristics to predict SVR were analyzed. Patients receiving 48 weeks of treatment had a greater SVR rate than those receiving 24 weeks of treatment (70.2% versus 46.2%, P = 0.001).

Compared to patients with favorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotype (69.2% versus 58.3%, risk difference (RD): 10.9% [95% CI: −5.9% to 27.7%]), patients with unfavorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotypes receiving 48-week therapy achieved a greater SVR rate than 24-week therapy (73.9% versus 8.3%, RD: 65.6% [95% CI: 44.5% to 86.7%]; interaction P = 0.002). The SVR rates of 48-week and 24-week treatment were similar when the patients had BMI &gt;30 kg/m2 (52.6% versus 50.0%, RD: 2.6% [95% CI: −33.5% to 38.8%]).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>The constitutional and laboratory adverse events (AEs) were similar between the two arms (Table 4).

      "<abstract><sec><title>Objectives:</title><p>The supermarket industry now services many customers through online food shopping over the Internet. The Internet shopping process offers a novel opportunity for the modification of dietary patterns. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on consumers' purchases of saturated fat of a fully automated computerised system that provided real-time advice tailored to the consumers' specific purchases recommending foods lower in saturated fat.</p></sec><sec><title>Design:</title><p>This study was a blinded, randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting:</title><p>The study was conducted in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants:</title><p>The participants were consumers using a commercial online Internet shopping site between February and June 2004.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions:</title><p>Individuals assigned to intervention received fully automated advice that recommended specific switches from selected products higher in saturated fat to alternate similar products lower in saturated fat. Participants assigned to control received general non-specific advice about how to eat a diet lower in saturated fat.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome Measures:</title><p>The outcome measure was the difference in saturated fat (grams per 100 g of food) in shopping baskets between the intervention and control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 497 randomised participants, mean age 40 y, each shopping for an average of about three people. The amount of saturated fat in the foods purchased by the intervention group was 0.66% lower (95% confidence interval 0.48–0.84, p &lt; 0.001) than in the control group. The effects of the intervention were sustained over consecutive shopping episodes, and there was no difference in the average cost of the food bought by each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Fully automated, purchase-specific dietary advice offered to customers during Internet shopping can bring about changes in food purchasing habits that are likely to have significant public health implications. Because implementation is simple to initiate and maintain, this strategy would likely be highly cost-effective.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 4,548 individuals were offered participation, and 497 were randomised (251 intervention and 246 control) (Figure 1). Of these, 456 (224 intervention and 232 control) completed at least one episode of shopping that included one or more of the 524 foods studied. Median follow-up time completed by the end of the study in June 2004 was 35 d, and the median number of shopping episodes done by participants was three (range 1–20).

This difference resulted from a decrease in the mean saturated fat content in the foods purchased following the advice offered to the intervention group of 0.77% (0.60–0.94, p &lt; 0.001), with no corresponding decrease in the control group 0.04% (0.00–0.08, p = 0.07). The effect estimate for the primary outcome was 0.62% (0.46–0.79, p &lt; 0.001) if analysis was restricted to only the 456 individuals that selected one of the 524 foods studied and was 0.58 (0.39–0.77, p &lt; 0.001) if the change in saturated fat was set to zero for those individuals that did not select one of the foods. The subgroup analyses provided some evidence that the intervention had greater effects among individuals with higher body mass index and among people above 40 y of age (for both, homogeneity p &lt; 0.03) (Table 3).

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Poor sanitation is thought to be a major cause of enteric infections among young children. However, there are no previously published randomized trials to measure the health impacts of large-scale sanitation programs. India's Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) is one such program that seeks to end the practice of open defecation by changing social norms and behaviors, and providing technical support and financial subsidies. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of the TSC implemented with capacity building support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program in Madhya Pradesh on availability of individual household latrines (IHLs), defecation behaviors, and child health (diarrhea, highly credible gastrointestinal illness [HCGI], parasitic infections, anemia, growth).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in 80 rural villages. Field staff collected baseline measures of sanitation conditions, behaviors, and child health (May–July 2009), and revisited households 21 months later (February–April 2011) after the program was delivered. The study enrolled a random sample of 5,209 children &lt;5 years old from 3,039 households that had at least one child &lt;24 months at the beginning of the study. A random subsample of 1,150 children &lt;24 months at enrollment were tested for soil transmitted helminth and protozoan infections in stool. The randomization successfully balanced intervention and control groups, and we estimated differences between groups in an intention to treat analysis. The intervention increased percentage of households in a village with improved sanitation facilities as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme by an average of 19% (95% CI for difference: 12%–26%; group means: 22% control versus 41% intervention), decreased open defecation among adults by an average of 10% (95% CI for difference: 4%–15%; group means: 73% intervention versus 84% control). However, the intervention did not improve child health measured in terms of multiple health outcomes (diarrhea, HCGI, helminth infections, anemia, growth). Limitations of the study included a relatively short follow-up period following implementation, evidence for contamination in ten of the 40 control villages, and bias possible in self-reported outcomes for diarrhea, HCGI, and open defecation behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The intervention led to modest increases in availability of IHLs and even more modest reductions in open defecation. These improvements were insufficient to improve child health outcomes (diarrhea, HCGI, parasite infection, anemia, growth). The results underscore the difficulty of achieving adequately large improvements in sanitation levels to deliver expected health benefits within large-scale rural sanitation programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link>NCT01465204</ext-link></p><p>Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Enrolment, Baseline Balance, and Attrition</title><p>Figure 2 depicts the study participants flow. The baseline survey enrolled a sample of 3,390 children &lt;5 years from 1,954 households from 80 villages. In the follow-up survey the sample size was increased to 5,209 children &lt;5 years from 3,039 households. As reported in Table 2, baseline covariates in intervention and control groups were well balanced with four exceptions. First, 89% of the households in the intervention group had access to improved water sources—tap/piped water, tube well and protected dug wells—compared to 80% of households in the control group. In contrast, a larger proportion of control households (54%) were observed to have soap and water at hand-washing locations used after defecation than in intervention households (44%). On average, more children were found to be anemic in the control group (93%) than in the intervention group (88%). Finally, average height-for-age Z-scores were also slightly imbalanced (−1.38 intervention versus −1.81 control). </p>\n",

These measures included: reported implementation by Block coordinators, expenditure of funds documented by official program records, and interviews with local village officials. Out of 40 intervention villages, staff collected administrative information on 39 villages from the TSC Block coordinators (government officers). The coordinators reported that 15/39 intervention villages received some CLTS activities, 33/39 villages applied for a NGP award prior to the follow-up survey. According to Block coordinators' records, 25/39 villages had 100% households with IHLs, 11/39 villages had 80%–99% households with IHLs, and three of 39 villages with 37%–68% households with IHLs. Block coordinators also reported that 21/39 villages received 100% of the funds allocated under the TSC program, 12/39 villages received between 50% and 99%, and six of 39 villages received &lt;50% of their allocated funds. The latest disbursement of the TSC funds was given to 36/39 intervention villages at least 4 to 5 months before the follow-up survey, which would offer sufficient time for IHLs to be constructed and used for 3 or more months.</p>\n",

      "<p>The study review meetings with Block coordinators also identified that some control villages were contaminated during the study period: TSC activities were initiated in eight control villages within a few months of baseline survey and possibly in two additional control villages a few months prior to the follow-up survey; official records were not available for control villages to ascertain this information objectively. As per the follow-up survey in these ten contaminated villages, the household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities increased from 17.4% at baseline to 41.4% at the follow-up, which is similar to the program effect we observed in the intervention group. The household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities in uncontaminated control villages increased from 10.7% to 16.2% in the same period. The study's long follow-up period (21 months) and the highly publicized and politicized nature of the TSC program may have contributed to this contamination.</p><p>Information from additional sources (village secretaries, school teachers, Anganwadi [pre-school] workers in the village, and the rapid assessment from random sample of households) confirmed that TSC activities translated into a higher recollection and knowledge of the TSC program in the intervention villages compared to the control villages.

      "<sec><title>IHL Coverage and Sanitation-Related Behaviors</title><p>Table 3 reports the intervention's effect on IHL availability (JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and any type of IHLs) and open defecation behaviors by household members. The intervention increased the coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facility by average 19 percentage points (95% CI 12%–26%; p-value&lt;0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (41.4% intervention versus 22.6% control). The intervention increased the coverage of any type of IHL facility by 20 percentage points (95% CI 13%–27%; p-value&lt;0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (44.1% intervention versus 24.2% control). These results indicate that available IHLs were predominantly JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and very few rudimentary latrines or latrines defined as unimproved by the JMP were built. These results are consistent with the TSC design that promoted latrine models that can safely contain the feces. </p><p>Although on average fewer households in intervention villages were likely to report daily open defecation compared to control villages for adult men (75% intervention versus 84% control; mean difference: 9.5%; p-value = 0.001), adult women (73% intervention versus 83% control; mean difference: 10%; p-value&lt;0.001), and children &lt;5 years (84% intervention versus 89% control; mean difference: 5%; p-value = 0.014), these reductions in reported open defecation behaviors were smaller than the gains in IHL availability. Amongst the 630 households in intervention villages that had JMP defined improved sanitation facilities at follow-up, 41% reported that adult men or women still practiced daily open defecation; this same figure was 28% among the 339 control village households at follow-up (not reported in results table). A follow-up debriefing question to households who had IHL identified that the main reasons for daily open defecation in spite of having IHL were culture, habit, or preference for defecating in open followed by inadequate water availability.</p></sec><sec><title>Drinking Water Quality</title><p>In control villages, 82% (331/403) of household drinking water samples tested positive for E. coli compared to 77% (310/404) of samples in intervention villages (mean difference: 5.5%; p-value = 0.050) (Table 3). Table S2 lists the distribution of positive household samples by different E. coli contamination level categories.</p><p>Of 511 water source samples tested, 74% (208/280) of the sources in control villages and 70% (162/231) in intervention villages tested positive for E. coli but the difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.143).</p></sec><title>Caregiver Reported Illness</title><p>Diarrhea prevalence did not differ between groups (7.4% intervention versus 7.7% control; p-value = 0.687) (Table 4).

This finding is consistent with the TSC design that targeted households without IHLs and offered larger IHL construction subsidies for BPL households. Among BPL households, the intervention increased JMP defined improved sanitation facilities coverage by 30 percentage points (48% intervention versus 18% control; p-value&lt;0.001) and it reduced open defecation among women by 17 percentage points (73% intervention versus 90% control; p-value&lt;0.001).

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Secondary efficacy endpoints included week 8 Clinical Global Impressions–Severity, Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement (CGI-I), and response (CGI-I ≤ 2). Safety assessments included adverse events, physical and vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.</p><p>Results: The safety population included 339 patients (children, n = 130; adolescents, n = 209). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, did not statistically separate from placebo, for either desvenlafaxine (adjusted mean [standard error] change, −22.6 [1.17]) or fluoxetine (−24.8 [1.17]; placebo, −23.1 [1.18]). Week 8 CGI-I response rates were significantly greater for fluoxetine (78.2%; p = 0.017) than for placebo (62.6%); desvenlafaxine (68.7%) did not differ from placebo. Other secondary outcomes were consistent with those obtained with CDRS-R. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable among treatment groups (desvenlafaxine, 60.0%; placebo, 70.5%; and fluoxetine, 64.3%). </p><p>Conclusion: Desvenlafaxine did not demonstrate efficacy for treating MDD in children and adolescents in this trial. Because neither desvenlafaxine nor the reference medication, fluoxetine, demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo on the primary endpoint, this was considered a failed trial and no efficacy conclusions can be drawn. Desvenlafaxine 25–50 mg/d was generally safe and well tolerated in children and adolescents in this study.</p></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 340 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 339 patients (children, n = 130; adolescents, n = 209) were included in the safety population (desvenlafaxine, n = 115; fluoxetine, n = 112; placebo, n = 112). The ITT population included 130 children and 207 adolescents. A total of 42 (12%) patients discontinued early (desvenlafaxine, 16 [14%]; fluoxetine, 13 [12%]; and placebo, 13 [12%]).

The optimal treatment to prevent hyperglycemic relapses after remission is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, 4-year, placebo-controlled study randomly assigned 48 African American subjects with DKA and severe hyperglycemia to metformin 1,000 mg daily (n = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg daily (n = 16), or placebo (n = 15) after normoglycemia remission. Hyperglycemic relapse was defined as fasting glucose &gt;130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and HbA1c &gt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at randomization and at 3 months and then every 6 months for a median of 331 days. Oral minimal model and incremental area under the curve for insulin (AUCi) were used to calculate insulin sensitivity (Si) and β-cell function, respectively. Disposition index (DI) was calculated as a product of Si and incremental AUCi.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Relapse-free survival was higher in sitagliptin and metformin (P = 0.015) compared with placebo, and mean time to relapse was significantly prolonged in the metformin and sitagliptin groups compared with the placebo group (480 vs. 305 days, P = 0.004). The probability of relapse was significantly lower for metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10–0.81]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10–0.98]) than for placebo. Subjects who remained in remission had a higher DI (P = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (P &lt; 0.001) than those with hyperglycemia relapse without significant changes in Si.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study shows that near-normoglycemia remission was similarly prolonged by treatment with sitagliptin and metformin. The prolongation of remission was due to improvement in β-cell function.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><p>Forty-eight African American subjects with DKA (n = 22) and severe hyperglycemia (n = 26) were included in the study. Seventeen subjects were randomly assigned to metformin 1,000 mg daily, 16 to sitagliptin 100 mg daily, and 15 to placebo. Four subjects in the metformin group, 6 in the sitagliptin group, and 1 in the placebo group were lost to follow-up. One subject in the sitagliptin group and one subject in the placebo group withdrew from the study.

Because only a small number of subjects experienced relapse in the medication groups (metformin [n = 5], sitagliptin [n = 4]) compared with placebo (n = 11), we combined the metformin and sitagliptin groups. There were no significant differences in HbA1c (8.0 ± 0.8% [64 ± 9 mmol/mol] vs. 8.2 ± 1.5% [66 ± 16 mmol/mol], P = 0.79) or blood glucose (152 ± 18 mg/dL [8.4 ± 1 mmol/L] vs. 160 ± 68 mg/dL [8.9 ± 3.8 mmol/L], P = 0.65) levels at the time of hyperglycemia relapse between the placebo group and the combined metformin and sitagliptin group.

There was a significant interaction between remission status and study visit for both Si (P = 0.01) and DI (P = 0.02), suggesting a different pattern of change in Si and DI over time between subjects with near-normoglycemia remission and hyperglycemia relapse. The difference in DI and incremental AUCi was not present at randomization in the subjects who stayed in near-normoglycemia remission compared with those who experienced a hyperglycemia relapse (Fig. 2A and B).

      "<sec><title>Changes in Eating Behavior</title><p>The study was not designed to detect the effects of the intervention on the outcome measures (no control group was included), but within-group comparisons were performed as part of the feasibility component of the pilot study. From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant increases in IES-2 total scores and all four IES-2 subscale scores (Table 4). There was no evidence that these improvements diminished at the 3-month follow-up. Based on use of the dichotomous variable (ie, binge eating vs no binge eating), 7 out of 14 women who reported eating a significantly large amount of food (ie, binge eating) at the preintervention assessment reported no binge eating at the postintervention assessment. There were no women who transitioned from no binge eating at the preintervention assessment to binge eating at the postintervention assessment or at the 3-month follow-up; 4 women who reported binge eating at postintervention no longer reported binge eating at the 3-month follow-up. McNemar’s test revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of women binge eating from the pre- to postintervention visits (P=.01) and a significant decrease from postintervention to follow-up (P&lt;.001). The median days women who were categorized as binge eaters reported binge eating at preintervention was 4.25 (IQR 2.5-10) days, at postintervention was 4 (IQR 2-8) days, and at the 3-month follow-up it was 2 (IQR 2-4) days. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to examine changes in the reported number of days women were unable to prevent or stop episodes of eating an unusually large amount of food and revealed a significant decrease from pre- to postintervention (P=.03) and no evidence of a change from postintervention to follow-up (P=.57).</p></sec><sec><title>Psychological Inflexibility, Quality of Life, and BMI</title><p>Psychological inflexibility decreased significantly from pre- to postintervention (mean change −4.23 [SD 7.13], P=.006), and there was a tendency for a further decrease in psychological inflexibility from postintervention to 3-month-follow-up (mean change −2.60 [SD 6.58], P=.06) (Table 4). There were no significant changes in general physical health from pre- to postintervention (pre- to postintervention PCS scores: mean change 0.29 [SD 9.35], P=.88; postintervention to 3-month follow-up PCS scores: mean change 1.26 [SD 10.46], P=.55). However, general mental health improved significantly from pre- to postintervention with a further improvement postintervention to 3-month follow-up (mean change 5.07 [SD 6.31], P&lt;.001; mean change 3.45 [SD 7.71], P=.03, respectively). There were no statistically significant changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention or postintervention to 3-month follow-up (mean change −0.13 [SD 0.88], P=.46 and mean change −0.01 [SD 0.57], P=.93, respectively).</p></sec><title>Associations Between Changes in Intuitive Eating With BMI and Psychological Inflexibility</title><p>Spearman correlations showed a statistically significant inverse relationship between pre- to postintervention change in total intuitive eating scores and pre- to postintervention change in BMI (rs=−.43, P=.03). Thus, greater decreases in BMI were associated with greater increases in intuitive eating. However, when relationships with individual subscales were examined, a significant association was found for only one subscale: greater decreases in BMI were associated with greater increases in eating for physical rather than emotional reasons (rs=−.56, P=.003). There was also a statistically significant inverse relationship between change in psychological inflexibility scores and change in intuitive eating scores (rs=−.52, P=.006); that is, greater improvements in psychological flexibility were associated with greater increases in total intuitive eating scores. Furthermore, larger improvements in psychological flexibility were associated with greater increases in two subscale scores: eating for physical rather than emotional reasons (rs=−.41, P=.04) and reliance on hunger and satiety cues (rs=−.62, P&lt;.001). A greater reduction in psychological inflexibility scores was also associated with a greater decrease in BMI (r=.41, P=.04).</p>\n",

      "<abstract><p>Learned irrelevance (LIrr) refers to a reduction in associative learning after pre-exposure of the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus in a non-contingent fashion. This paradigm might serve as a translational model for (pre)attentive information processing deficits in schizophrenia. This is the first study to investigate the event-related potentials (ERPs) of a within-subject LIrr paradigm in humans. Furthermore, the effects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden on LIrr were assessed. As expected, LIrr was found to be intact in young healthy volunteers after placebo. Furthermore, in the placebo condition P3b latency was decreased for target stimuli, which were pre-cued. This suggests that the predictability of the occurrence of these stimuli is mainly reflected by this ERP component. Biperiden had no effect on the behavioural LIrr measures, although prolonged reaction times were evident. Biperiden increased the N1 amplitude of the pre-exposed predictor letters, suggesting an effect of this drug on early perceptual processing. In conclusion, the within-subject paradigm used in the current study in combination with electroencephalography can reveal brain mechanisms involved in LIrr. M1 antagonism did not affect LIrr performance but seemed to influence early information processing.</p></abstract>\n",

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Little information is available about whether the use of self-assessment instruments in primary care affects depression course and outcome. The purpose was to evaluate whether using a depression self-rating scale in recurrent person-centred GP consultations affected depression severity, quality of life, medication use, and sick leave frequency.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients in the intervention group met their GP regularly at least 4 times during the 3 months intervention. In addition to treatment as usual (TAU), patients completed a self-assessment instrument (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) on each occasion, and then GPs used the completed instrument as the basis for a person-centred discussion of changes in depression symptoms. The control group received TAU. Frequency of visits in the TAU arm was the result of the GPs’ and patients’ joint assessments of care need in each case.</p><p>Depression severity was measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), quality of life with EQ-5D, and psychological well-being with the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Data on sick leave, antidepressant and sedatives use, and care contacts were collected from electronic patient records. All variables were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Mean intra-individual changes were compared between the intervention and TAU group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences between the intervention and control group in depression severity reduction or remission rate, change in quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative prescriptions, or sick leave during the whole 12-month follow-up. However, significantly more patients in the intervention group continued antidepressants until the 6 month follow-up (86/125 vs 78/133, p &lt; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When GPs used a depression self-rating scale in recurrent consultations, patients more often continued antidepressant medication according to guidelines, compared to TAU patients. However, reduction of depressive symptoms, remission rate, quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative use, sick leave, and health care use 4-12 months was not significantly different from the TAU group. These findings suggest that frequent use of depression rating scales in person-centred primary care consultations has no further additional effect on patients’ depression or well-being, sick leave, or health care use.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link>NCT01402206</ext-link>.

      "<abstract><sec><title>OBJECTIVE</title><p>After intensive insulin treatment, many obese African American patients with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hyperglycemia are able to achieve near-normoglycemia remission. The optimal treatment to prevent hyperglycemic relapses after remission is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, 4-year, placebo-controlled study randomly assigned 48 African American subjects with DKA and severe hyperglycemia to metformin 1,000 mg daily (n = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg daily (n = 16), or placebo (n = 15) after normoglycemia remission. Hyperglycemic relapse was defined as fasting glucose &gt;130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and HbA1c &gt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at randomization and at 3 months and then every 6 months for a median of 331 days. Oral minimal model and incremental area under the curve for insulin (AUCi) were used to calculate insulin sensitivity (Si) and β-cell function, respectively. Disposition index (DI) was calculated as a product of Si and incremental AUCi.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Relapse-free survival was higher in sitagliptin and metformin (P = 0.015) compared with placebo, and mean time to relapse was significantly prolonged in the metformin and sitagliptin groups compared with the placebo group (480 vs. 305 days, P = 0.004). The probability of relapse was significantly lower for metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10–0.81]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10–0.98]) than for placebo. Subjects who remained in remission had a higher DI (P = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (P &lt; 0.001) than those with hyperglycemia relapse without significant changes in Si.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study shows that near-normoglycemia remission was similarly prolonged by treatment with sitagliptin and metformin. The prolongation of remission was due to improvement in β-cell function.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><p>Forty-eight African American subjects with DKA (n = 22) and severe hyperglycemia (n = 26) were included in the study. Seventeen subjects were randomly assigned to metformin 1,000 mg daily, 16 to sitagliptin 100 mg daily, and 15 to placebo. Four subjects in the metformin group, 6 in the sitagliptin group, and 1 in the placebo group were lost to follow-up. One subject in the sitagliptin group and one subject in the placebo group withdrew from the study. The overall median follow-up after insulin discontinuation was 331 days (interquartile range 102, 612 days) with no differences between randomized groups (Table 1). The subjects lost to follow-up or who withdrew from the study were in near-normoglycemia remission during their last documented study visit. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics at presentation between subjects who withdrew and those who stayed in the study, except for HbA1c. HbA1c was lower at presentation of DKA/hyperglycemia in subjects who withdrew compared with those who stayed (12.0 ± 2.3% [107 ± 25 mmol/mol] vs. 13.5 ± 2.0% [124 ± 22 mmol/mol], P = 0.03) but was similar at randomization.</p>\n",

Patients were randomized into 2 groups; cooling group consisted of 19 patients (59.4%) and no cooling group consisted of 13 patients (40.6%). Finally, further stratification of cooling group based on the temperature of infused solution created 3 analyzable groups; mild cooling consisted of 10 patients (31.3%), deep cooling of 9 patients (28.1%) and no cooling of 13 patients (40.6%). The mean ages of the recruited patients were 28.9, 26.7 and 45.5 years old for the mild cooling, deep cooling and no cooling groups, respectively. Fifteen patients were admitted with GCS of 6 (46.9%) and 17 patients with GCS of 7 (53.1%). Among these, 28 patients (87.5%) underwent unilateral decompresive craniectomy, while four patients had bifrontal decompressive craniectomy (12.5%). Table 1 illustrates those parameters where all groups were comparable with non-statistical difference shown for gender, GCS, ISS, Marshall score and clotting profiles.

Cooling the severely injured brain which had underwent decompressive craniectomy did not reduce the ICP further, but instead shown marked improvements in CPP and Licox PtiO2 after 12 h of cooling. Figure 2 discloses mean ICP values and patterns for the three studied groups. All ICP readings stayed below 25 mmHg, and marked fluctuations were noted in cooling groups. Figures 3 and 4 reveal mean values and trends for CPP and Licox PtiO2, respectively. Mild cooling group had ascending trends of CPP with mean values above 60 mmHg but &lt;75 mmHg together with PtiO2 mean values of above 40 mmHg after 12 h of cooling therapy. Interestingly, the deep cooling group did have similar ascending trends for CPP and PtiO2 but their mean values after 12 h of cooling therapy were above 75 mmHg and &lt;30 mmHg, respectively. Figure 5 gives additional information on brain-body (axillary) temperature gradient and types of cooling therapy.

      "<abstract><p>Acupressure on local and distal acupuncture points might result in sedation and relaxation, thereby reducing chronic neck pain. The aim was to investigate the effect of acupressure at local (LP) and distal acupuncture points (DP) in females with chronic neck pain. Thirty-three females were assigned to three groups: the control group did not receive any stimuli, the LP group received acupressure at local acupuncture points, GB 21, SI 14 and SI 15, and the DP group received acupressure at distal acupuncture points, LI 4, LI 10 and LI 11. Verbal rating scale (VRS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), muscle hardness (MH), salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) activity, heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) values and satisfaction due to acupressure were assessed. VRS, NDI, STAI and MH values decreased after acupressure in the LP and the DP group. HR decreased and the power of high frequency (HF) component of HRV increased after acupressure in only the LP group. Although acupressure on not only the LP but also the DP significantly improved pain conditions, acupressure on only the LP affected the autonomic nervous system while acupuncture points per se have different physical effects according to location. </p></abstract><sec><title>3.

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Working memory (WM) often is impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such impairment may underlie core deficits in cognition and social functioning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance WM in both healthy adults and clinical populations, but its efficacy in ASD is unknown. We predicted that bifrontal tDCS would improve WM performances of adults with high-functioning autism during active stimulation compared to sham stimulation and that such enhancement would generalize to an untrained task.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twelve adults with high-functioning ASD engaged in a battery of WM tasks that included backward spatial span, backward digit span, spatial n-back and letter n-back. While engaged, 40 min of 1.5 mA bifrontal stimulation was applied over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Using a single-blind crossover design, each participant received left anodal/right cathodal stimulation, right anodal/left cathodal stimulation, or sham stimulation, in randomized counterbalanced order on three separate days. Following tDCS, participants again engaged in letter and spatial n-back tasks before taking the Brief Test of Attention (BTA). We used repeated-measures ANOVA to compare overall performance on the WM battery as measured by a composite of z-scores for all five measures. Post hoc ANOVAs, t tests, Friedman’s tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to measure the online and offline effects of tDCS and to assess performances on individual measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to sham stimulation, both left DLPFC anodal stimulation (t11 = 5.4, p = 0.0002) and right DLPFC anodal stimulation (t11 = 3.57, p = 0.004) improved overall WM performance. Left anodal stimulation (t11 = 3.9, p = 0.003) and right anodal stimulation (t11 = 2.7, p = 0.019) enhanced performances during stimulation. Enhancement transferred to an untrained task 50 min after right anodal stimulation (z11 = 2.263, p = 0.024). The tasks that showed the largest effects of active stimulation were spatial span backward (z11 = 2.39, p = 0.017) and BTA (z11 = 2.263, p = 0.024).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In adults with high-functioning ASD, active bifrontal tDCS given during WM tasks appears to improve performance. TDCS benefits also transferred to an untrained task completed shortly after stimulation. These results suggest that tDCS can improve WM task performance and could reduce some core deficits of autism.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link>NCT01602263</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Primary outcome: overall WM performance</title>As shown in the final row of Table 1, the composite z-scores (full battery) were −0.25 (SD 0.71) for sham stimulation, 0.13 (SD 0.82) for left anodal stimulation, and 0.11 (SD 0.81) for right anodal stimulation, which repeated measures ANOVA showed to be significantly different (F2,22 = 12.85, p = 0.0002). Post hoc, paired-sample t tests revealed that performances associated with both left anodal active stimulation (t11 = 5.4, p = 0.0002) and right anodal active stimulation (t11 = 3.57, p = 0.004) were better than performances associated with sham tDCS. For composite z-scores (full battery), Cohen’s ds effect sizes were 0.50 for left anodal stimulation and 0.47 for right anodal stimulation. There was no difference in overall WM performance between the two active stimulation conditions (t11 = 0.26, p = 0.796). To assess the role of session order on full-battery composite z-scores, we compared them across sessions. We found composite z-scores (full battery) of −0.03 (SD 0.81) for session 1, −0.06 (SD 0.75) for session 2, and 0.09 (SD 0.83) for session 3.

The evolution of haematological parameters was estimated between 26 and 35 wk (zidovudine/placebo) and between 35 wk and delivery to compare a long versus short zidovudine exposure.

However, between 35 wk and delivery, the haematological parameters increased faster in women exposed to long rather than short durations of zidovudine (0.1 [0.0 to 0.1]; 105 [18 to 191]; 147 [59 to 234], respectively).

Around 15%–30% of babies born to HIV-positive women will themselves become infected, if the woman avoids breast-feeding but does not use any other means of preventing the virus from being passed on. However, if a drug, zidovudine (AZT), is given during pregnancy the chance of HIV being passed on to a baby drops from around 23% to around 8%. In some settings it may not be realistic to give the standard course of zidovudine, from 28 weeks of pregnancy, because of its cost and complexity. A number of trials have therefore looked at whether standard-course and short-course zidovudine are equivalent at reducing the risk of passing on HIV from mother to baby. One trial, the Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial-1 (PHPT-1) found that the short treatment course was substantially less effective at preventing HIV from being passed on from mother to baby. Current international guidance therefore recommends starting zidovudine at 28 weeks of pregnancy. However, zidovudine does have several side effects, including anemia; it can also cause a drop in the levels of certain types of white blood cell, and is thought to be toxic to bone marrow. The researchers who had carried out the PHPT-1 trial therefore wanted to do a subsequent analysis of data from that trial to find out whether there were any differences in these safety outcomes between standard and short course zidovudine.</p><p>What the trial shows: In total 1,436 women were recruited into the trial and assigned to receive either zidovudine from 28 weeks of pregnancy until delivery (standard course; 769 women), or from 35 weeks to delivery (short course; 667). Blood tests were performed at 26, 32, and 35 weeks of pregnancy and then at delivery, and the main outcomes assessed in this secondary analysis were the hemoglobin levels (to check for anemia), and levels of white blood cells, including the levels of two particular types (neutrophils and lymphocytes). The researchers found that standard-course zidovudine resulted in a drop at 35 weeks in the levels of hemoglobin and white blood cells, relative to short-course zidovudine. However, by the time of delivery these levels had recovered and no significant differences could be observed between the two arms of the trial. Women receiving standard-course zidovudine were more likely to experience severe anemia, which although a rare event in both arms of the trial, could have serious outcomes.</p><p>Strengths and limitations: The original trial from which these data were collected was a relatively large, randomized study and in which there was a low rate of loss to follow up. Although no formal sample size calculation was performed for the analyses presented here, the study probably had sufficient power to detect small differences in the outcomes assessed. A key limitation of this study is that the analyses presented here are a secondary exploration of data from the PHPT-1 trial and should therefore be seen as hypotheses to test in further studies, rather than as definitive conclusions.</p><p>Contribution to the evidence: The analyses presented here add to the findings of the parent trial, PHPT-1, by providing additional data about the toxicity of zidovudine. Other trials have not clearly established whether there are differences between short- and standard-course zidovudine in terms of their toxicity. The findings support current guidelines recommending standard-course zidovudine therapy for HIV-positive pregnant women. It is also crucial that efforts are made to ensure women worldwide can get access to facilities for monitoring the status of their HIV infection, and then receive highly active antiretroviral therapy when it is needed.</p></sec></abstract><title>RESULTS</title>\n",

      "<abstract><p>Cervical degenerative disease is one of the most common spinal disorders worldwide, especially in older people. Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) is a useful method for the surgical treatment of multi-level cervical degenerative disease. Anterior cervical disc replacement (ACDR) is considered as an alternative surgical method. However, both methods have drawbacks, particularly the neck motion decrease observed after arthrodesis, and arthroplasty should only be performed on patients presenting with cervical disc disease but without any vertebral body disease. Therefore, we designed a non-fusion cervical joint system, namely an artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC), to provide a novel treatment for multi-level cervical degenerative disease. To enhance the long-term stability of ACVC, we applied a hydroxyapatite (HA) biocoating on the surface of the artificial joint. Thirty-two goats were randomly divided into four groups: a sham control group, an ACVC group, an ACVC-HA group, and an ACCF group (titanium and plate fixation group). We performed the prosthesis implantation in our previously established goat model. We compared the clinical, radiological, biomechanical, and histological outcomes among these four different groups for 24 weeks post surgery. The goats successfully tolerated the entire experimental procedure. The kinematics data for the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups were similar. The range of motion (ROM) in adjacent level increased after ACCF but was not altered after ACVC or ACVC-HA implantation. Compared with the control group, no significant difference was found in ROM and neutral zone (NZ) in flexion-extension or lateral bending for the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups, whereas the ROM and NZ in rotation were significantly greater. Compared with the ACCF group, the ROM and NZ significantly increased in all directions. Overall, stiffness was significantly decreased in the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups compared with the control group and the ACCF group. Similar results were found after a fatigue test of 5,000 repetitions of axial rotation. The histological results showed more new bone formation and better bone implant contact in the ACVC-HA group than the ACVC group. Goat is an excellent animal model for cervical spine biomechanical study. Compared with the intact state and the ACCF group, ACVC could provide immediate stability and preserve segmental movement after discectomy and corpectomy. Besides, HA biocoating provide a better bone ingrowth, which is essential for long-term stability. In conclusion, ACVC-HA brings new insight to treat cervical degenerative disease.</p></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Design of different artificial cervical joints</title><p>Fig 1 shows photographs of the ACVC (Fig 1B), the ACVC-HA (Fig 1C), and the titanium cage and the anterior plate (Fig 1D) implants. The ball-in-trough structure (Fig 1A-7 and 1A-8) is the most important part of this unconstrained metal-on-metal ACVC joint. In theory, the ball-in-trough articulation allows a 20° ROM in flexion-extension, a 12° ROM in lateral bending, a 360° ROM in rotation, and a 1.5-mm anterior-posterior slide horizontally. The ACVC-HA is an ACVC treated with a 30-μm hydroxyapatite biocoating via microarc oxidation technology. The titanium cage and the anterior plate were used for goat anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. The titanium cage was 8 mm wide and could be cut to a suitable length. Because the vertebral bodies of goats are much longer than those of humans, four to eight screws could be used to fix the plate and the cage. The vertebral components were hollow-structured, which allowed the surgeons to implant the autologous bone in the hollow space. Thus, the surrounding bone could grow into the vertebral components through the holes, this providing long-term stability.                 </p></sec>\n",

      "<abstract><p>Stress-related illnesses are a growing health problem in the Western world; which also has economic significance for society. As a consequence; there is a growing demand for effective treatments. The study investigates the long-term efficacy of the Nacadia® nature-based therapy (NNBT) by comparing it to the efficacy of a validated cognitive behavioral therapy, called STreSS. The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial in which 84 participants are randomly allocated between the treatments. Long-term efficacy is investigated through data extracts from the national database of Statistics Denmark on the sick leave and the health-care consumption. The results show that both the NNBT and the STreSS lead to a significant decrease in number of contacts with a general practitioner in the period from twelve months prior to treatment to twelve months after treatment; and, a significant decrease in long-term sick leave from the month prior to treatment to twelve months after treatment. The positive long-term effects provide validation for the NNBT as an efficient treatment of stress-related illnesses.</p></abstract><sec><title>3. Results</title><p>Of the 83 participants allocated between the two treatments, 41 participants completed the NBT treatment and 40 participants completed the CBT treatment (see Figure 1). Four participants in the NBT were lost to follow-up because the correct personal identification number was not provided. Five participants were lost to follow-up in the CBT; four participants did not provide the correct personal identification number; and, one participant withdrew consent after the treatment.</p><p>The results from the background questionnaire showed that the vast majority of participants were women (NBT: 82%, CBT: 82%) with a mean age of 47.9 in NBT and 44.9 in CBT [11]. The majority had a university bachelor degree or higher education (NBT: 76%, CBT: 68%). The categorization of participants with respect to socioeconomic status showed an even distribution between the two treatments; the majority of participants in both NBT and CBT were employed at the start of treatment (NBT = 20; CBT = 21), and a great number held a top-level position (NBT = 13; CBT = 12) (Table 1). A substantial proportion of participants were also registered as unemployed at treatment start (NBT = 18; CBT = 18). Of those, 17 participants from the NBT and 16 participants from the CBT were fired from work during the twelve months preceding the start of treatment. Moreover, one participant in the NBT and two participants in the CBT quit their job during that period.</p><sec><title>3.1. Sick Leave </title><p>All of the participants were rated as incapacitated for work for at least three months prior to treatment start, as stated in the inclusion criteria, but not all participants were registered as being on sick leave in Statistics Denmark prior to treatment start (Figure 2). They were, instead, registered as receiving other rehabilitation benefits or as students. </p><p>The sample distributions, representing the number of months of sick leave, expressed significant deviations from the normal distribution (p &lt; 0.05). Efforts to establish normal distributions using various types of statistical transformations were unsuccessful.</p><p>No significant change was found in the total number of months of sick leave for the participants in the period from twelve months before the treatment compared to the twelve months after the treatment for either the NBT or the CBT treatments (p &gt; 0.05). Figure 2 illustrates the continous increase in the number of participants on sick-leave in the twelve months up to the start of treatment and, similarly, the similar decrease in the number of participants on sick leave from the end of the treatment to twelve months after.</p><p>A significant decrease was found between the participants on sick leave one month prior to treatment and in month twelve after treatment (NBT: p &lt; 0.001; CBT: p &lt; 0.01), (Table 2).</p><p>23 participants (77%) who were on sick leave prior to treatment and received the NBT treatment were not on sick leave twelve months after completing the treatment (Table 2). 15 participants (60%) who were on sick leave prior to treatment start and received the CBT treatment were not on sick leave twelve months after completing the treatment (Table 2). In total, 27 participants from the NBT group and 20 participants from the CBT group were not on sick leave after completing the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>3.2. Healthcare Consumption</title><p>For the NBT and the CBT, there was a significant reduction in number of contacts with a GP twelve months after treatment as compared to the twelve months before treatment (NBT p ˂ 0.01; CBT p ˂ 0.05) (Table 3). The sizes of the effect were r = −0.396 (NBT) and r = −0.249 (CBT).</p><p>In terms of the number of contacts, the median number of contacts with a GP is still much higher for the participants one year after the treatment for both the NBT and the CBT groups when compared to the adult population of Denmark as a whole (mean number of contacts = 5.95) [24]. (Because the sample did not show a normal distribution, it was decided to use the median value instead of the mean value, which is used in the national sample. Nevertheless, the two statistical measures are still comparable in terms of understanding the central tendency of the statistical scores).</p></sec></sec><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Participant flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><fig><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The proportion of participants on sick leave from twelve months prior to twelve months after a treatment.

      "<title>Results</title><sec><title>Sample demographics</title><p>Participants (n = 190) were recruited from 40 states and all were licensed or certified to conduct substance abuse treatment. Certified drug and alcohol providers comprised 33% of the sample, 31% were social workers, and were 18% Licensed Professional Counselors, with the remaining 18% in various other disciplines such as psychologists, physicians and nurses. Participants reported that they spent, on average, 25.62 (SD = 11.16) h per week treating clients with substance use disorders. Women comprised 62% of the sample. Participants were 79.7% White, 5.9% Black or African American, 2.6% American Indian/Alaska Native, 0.7% Asian or Asian American, 5.9% Hispanic, 5.2% other backgrounds (See  Table 2 ). All participants were fluent in spoken and written English. The two groups were examined for differences in relevant baseline measures. Groups were equivalent with regard to all examined characteristics including gender, ethnicity, education, and experience. At baseline, there were no differences between groups on measures of clinician speech (e.g., MICO, reflection:question ratio, percent complex reflections; all p &gt; 0.38) or client speech (change talk, sustain talk, percent CT; all p &gt; 0.42).</p></sec><sec><title>Participant attrition and follow up</title><p>A total of 776 work samples were collected across all follow-up points. To ensure that the data reflected the effects of training enrichments, samples from participants who completed fewer than three consult calls were excluded. Samples that did not adhere to study criteria (i.e., role-played sessions, non-SUD target behaviors, more than seven sessions with same client) were similarly excluded, as were inaudible sessions. This resulted in a sample of 609 sessions, or 78.5% of all sessions submitted, with 81.7% at 3 months, 73.2% at 6 months and 51% at 12 months. After each follow-up, participants received global ratings of their MI proficiency based upon their MISC ratings of the submitted sample. There were no between-group differences on the number of work samples submitted at any follow-up (all p &gt; 0.25), nor were there any differences between groups in the number of consult calls completed (t(189) = 0.404, p &gt; 0.60, d = 0.0594).</p></sec><sec><title>Interrater reliability estimates for coding of worksamples</title><p>A subset of 72 randomly selected recordings (11.8%) were coded by the 6 coders completing the majority (84.7%) of all recordings. Intraclass correlations (ICC’s) across all six coders for behavior counts ranged from 0.59 to 0.99 (Cicchetti, 1994). For this reliability sample, 34.7% of the total tapes were drawn from MIU, 65.3% from LEAF, (t(71) = 2.704, p &lt; 0.01), indicating that despite random selection the LEAF condition was oversampled. Since the most challenging behaviors to code (RefCT, RefST) are more frequent in the LEAF condition, this disparity in the sampling may have resulted in an underestimate of the reliability of the coders for the entire sample of tapes. (See  Table 3 for all reliability estimates.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis plan</title><p>Because outcome measures were nested within participants, multilevel modeling was used to assess the impact of the experimental manipulation. Our analyses examined client language both 1) at the 3 month follow up and 2) in all follow-up periods simultaneously. Mediation analyses focused on the 3 month follow up period. We used the PROCESS software (Hayes, 2013) to examine the relationship between group assignment and client language, mediated by the directional reflections of the providers (a strategy emphasized in the MI Leaf condition). We expected that group assignment (MI AU v MI Leaf) would predict the type of reflections used by participants in their follow up work samples (A path) and that directional reflections would predict client speech in those sessions (B path). Overall, we expected to see a relationship between group assignment and client speech (C path).</p></sec><sec><title>Was there a training effect for the MI workshop?</title><sec><title>Knowledge test</title><p>The MI Knowledge Test was used as the outcome measure to estimate the impact of training.

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Web-based, computer-tailored nutrition education interventions can be effective in modifying self-reported dietary behaviors. Traditional computer-tailored programs primarily targeted individual cognitions (knowledge, awareness, attitude, self-efficacy). Tailoring on additional variables such as self-regulation processes and environmental-level factors (the home food environment arrangement and perception of availability and prices of healthy food products in supermarkets) may improve efficacy and effect sizes (ES) of Web-based computer-tailored nutrition education interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>This study evaluated the short- and medium-term efficacy and educational differences in efficacy of a cognitive and environmental feedback version of a Web-based computer-tailored nutrition education intervention on self-reported fruit, vegetable, high-energy snack, and saturated fat intake compared to generic nutrition information in the total sample and among participants who did not comply with dietary guidelines (the risk groups).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized controlled trial was conducted with a basic (tailored intervention targeting individual cognition and self-regulation processes; n=456), plus (basic intervention additionally targeting environmental-level factors; n=459), and control (generic nutrition information; n=434) group. Participants were recruited from the general population and randomly assigned to a study group. Self-reported fruit, vegetable, high-energy snack, and saturated fat intake were assessed at baseline and at 1- (T1) and 4-months (T2) postintervention using online questionnaires. Linear mixed model analyses examined group differences in change over time. Educational differences were examined with group×time×education interaction terms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the total sample, the basic (T1: ES=–0.30; T2: ES=–0.18) and plus intervention groups (T1: ES=–0.29; T2: ES=–0.27) had larger decreases in high-energy snack intake than the control group. The basic version resulted in a larger decrease in saturated fat intake than the control intervention (T1: ES=–0.19; T2: ES=–0.17). In the risk groups, the basic version caused larger decreases in fat (T1: ES=–0.28; T2: ES=–0.28) and high-energy snack intake (T1: ES=–0.34; T2: ES=–0.20) than the control intervention. The plus version resulted in a larger increase in fruit (T1: ES=0.25; T2: ES=0.37) and a larger decrease in high-energy snack intake (T1: ES=–0.38; T2: ES=–0.32) than the control intervention. For high-energy snack intake, educational differences were found. Stratified analyses showed that the plus version was most effective for high-educated participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both intervention versions were more effective in improving some of the self-reported dietary behaviors than generic nutrition information, especially in the risk groups, among both higher- and lower-educated participants. For fruit intake, only the plus version was more effective than providing generic nutrition information. Although feasible, incorporating environmental-level information is time-consuming. Therefore, the basic version may be more feasible for further implementation, although inclusion of feedback on the arrangement of the home food environment and on availability and prices may be considered for fruit and, for high-educated people, for high-energy snack intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Netherlands Trial Registry NTR3396; http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3396 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6VNZbdL6w).</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Participant Characteristics at Baseline</title><p>A total of 1349 participants were included in the analyses. The mean age of the participants was 49.05 years (SD 10.62), 35.43% (478/1349) were male, 1.34% (18/1348) had a non-Western ethnic background, and 45.66% (616/1349) were in the high-educated group (Table 1). The mean daily vegetable intake was 159.12 grams (SD 69.24), daily fruit intake was 1.85 pieces (SD 1.29), daily high-energy snack intake was 3.34 pieces (SD 2.98), and mean saturated fat intake was 17.91 fat points (SD 6.07). The sizes of the risk groups were as follows: 1014 participants (75.17%) did not comply with the recommendation of 200 grams of vegetables a day, 803 participants (59.53%) did not comply with the guideline of 2 pieces of fruit per day, 808 participants (59.90%) consumed more than 2 high-energy snacks per day, and 627 participants (46.48%) did not comply with the age- and gender-specific guidelines for maximum fat intake. The plus group was significantly younger than the control group (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, P=.04) and the plus group consisted of more lower-educated people than the basic group (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.74, P=.04). Hence, age and education were included in the repeated measures analyses as covariates in addition to place of residence.</p>\n",

Use of a drainage method to protect the suture line from leakage is a matter of controversy.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives:</title><p>We have compared the surgical outcome of Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty for UPJO repair, with or without internal stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>Eighty-two patients with UPJO were evaluated from 1996 to 2002. Complicated or emergent cases were excluded. Classic standard dismembered pyeloplasty was performed. Internal drainage, with a double j catheter, was performed in several patients, randomly. Another drain was also placed in the retroperitoneal space. The follow-up of patients was planned weekly, with patient visits and urine analysis and intravenous pyelography (IVP) and diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) scan after one month.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study group consisted of 51 male and 31 female patients, who were mostly in the age range of 20 - 40 years. Comparing the two techniques of pyeloplasty with or without internal drainage, there was no significant difference between groups regarding extravasation and anastomosis complications, such as leakage, stenosis, urinoma formation or evidence of obstruction on postoperative IVP or DTPA scan. However, a higher incidence of catheter related urinary symptoms and flank pain was reported among those with internal stent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pyeloplasty, with adequate spatulation, hemostasis and a watertight anastomosis, represents the mainstay of successful pyeloplasty and there may be no significant benefit for urethral stenting, especially in non-complicated cases.</p></sec></abstract>\n",

      "<sec><title>4. Results</title><p>Double stenting was used in 30 cases and pyeloplasty without internal drainage was performed in 52 patients. Both groups were similar in age and sex distribution. The most common symptom was severe flank pain, which was present in 69% of patients. History of urinary tract infection was detected in 47% and 51% reported associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Pyuria was seen in 58% and only 36% of patients had positive urine culture, with Escherichia coli (E. coli) as the most common pathogen (60%). The preoperative sonographic evaluation and IVP results are shown in Table 1. Intraoperative assessments showed ureteropelvic junction segmental atresia in 45 cases and aberrant vessels in 25 patients. The postoperative course was compared in two groups of patients, with and without internal drainage (Table 2). Among patients with extravasation in DTPA scan in the stent free group, retrograde DJ stent was inserted in four cases that had unacceptable drainage due to inflammation. One patient had distal ureter obstruction because of distal ureter stone, that was treated by Trans-ureteral lithotripsy (TULP) and stent support. Three other cases had no anatomical abnormality, and they were followed and extravasation resolved spontaneously at control IVP after one month. Removal of DJ stent was planned in one month after operation. However, eight cases missed the time and late stent removal was accompanied with several complications, such as stone formation on the tip of catheter in the bladder of a patient that needed TULP before stent removal.</p><table-wrap><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Results of Preoperative Ultrasonography and Intravenous Pyelography Evaluation a, b</title></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Imaging Method</th><th>Right Kidney</th><th>Left Kidney</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sonography</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Severe hydronephrosis</td><td>28 (34.6)</td><td>35 (43.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate hydronephrosis</td><td>8 (9.9)</td><td>9 (11.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Mild hydronephrosis</td><td>6 (7.4)</td><td>3 (3.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Without hydronephrosis</td><td>39 (48)</td><td>34 (42)</td></tr><tr><td>IVP</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No secretion</td><td>6 (7.3)</td><td>9 (11)</td></tr><tr><td>Delayed secretion</td><td>33 (40.2)</td><td>38 (46.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Normal secretion</td><td>43 (52.4)</td><td>35 (42.7)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>aAbbreviation: IVP, intravenous pyelography</p></fn><fn><p>bData are presented as No. (%).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparing Postoperative Course Between Patients who Underwent Pyeloplasty With or Without Internal Drainage a, b</title></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Post-Operative Course</th><th>With Stent (n = 30)</th><th>Without Stent (n = 52)</th><th>P Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Drain removal</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>In 48 hours</td><td>12 (40)</td><td>17 (32.7)</td><td>0.583</td></tr><tr><td>After 2 days</td><td>18 (60)</td><td>34 (65.4)</td><td>0.632</td></tr><tr><td>Mean hospital stay, d</td><td>36 ± 1.74</td><td>3.4 ± 1.30</td><td>0.841</td></tr><tr><td>Urine analysis c</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hematuria</td><td>19/27</td><td>32/32</td><td>0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Pyuria</td><td>12/27</td><td>20/32</td><td>0.008</td></tr><tr><td>Post-operative IVP (one month later)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Extravasation</td><td>2 (6.7)</td><td>8 (15.3)</td><td>0.209</td></tr><tr><td>Delayed secretion</td><td>19 (63.3)</td><td>25 (48.1)</td><td>0.124</td></tr><tr><td>Visible ureter</td><td>18 (60)</td><td>41 (78.8)</td><td>0.633</td></tr><tr><td>DTPA scand</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Partial obstruction</td><td>8/20</td><td>13/44</td><td>0.716</td></tr><tr><td>Urinary symptoms </td><td>24 (80)</td><td>2 (3.8)</td><td>0.005</td></tr><tr><td>Urinoma</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (1.9)</td><td>0.324</td></tr><tr><td>Recurrence of stenosis</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>reoperation</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (1.9)</td><td>0.324</td></tr><tr><td>Stent remnants</td><td>2 (6.7)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0.041</td></tr><tr><td>Flank pain at voiding</td><td>10 (33.3)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0.001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>aAbbreviations: IVP, intravenous pyelography; DTPA, diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate.</p></fn><fn><p>bData are presented as No. (%).</p></fn><fn><p>cUrine analysis was done in 27 patients of the stent group and 32 cases of the stent free group.</p></fn><fn><p>dDTPA scan was done in 20 patients of stent group and 32 cases of stent free group.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec>\n",

Forty healthy participants aged 19–65 years were randomly assigned to either a balance or relaxation training intervention. Each group exercised twice a week for a total of 12 weeks. Pre- and posttests assessed balance performance, cardiorespiratory fitness, memory, spatial cognition, and executive functions. Only the balance group significantly increased in balance performance from pre- to posttest, while cardiorespiratory fitness remained unchanged in both groups. Moreover, the balance group significantly improved in memory and spatial cognition. Effects on executive functions were not observed. These results suggest that balance training is capable of improving particularly memory and spatial cognition. Therefore, an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition. It might be speculated that stimulating the vestibular system during balance training induces changes of the hippocampus and parietal cortex possibly via direct pathways between the vestibular system and these brain regions.</p></abstract><title>Results</title><p>Participants of the balance and the relaxation group did not differ with respect to age, gender, vocabulary score, cardiorespiratory fitness, self-reported physical activity, and psychopathological symptoms (see Table 1).

      "<sec><title>Patient disposition</title><p>Between 29 September 2009 and 08 March 2013, a total of 92 patients with NSCLC were randomly assigned 2:1 to the BTH1677 or the Control arm. As shown in Fig. 1, 59 patients in the BTH1677 arm and 30 patients in the Control arm were treated and included in the safety and survival analyses. The blinded central radiology review primary efficacy population included 50 patients (48 patients response evaluable) in the BTH1677 arm and 23 patients in the Control arm. The primary reason for patient exclusion from the primary efficacy population was that an evaluable baseline or post-baseline CT scan was not available or acceptable to the central radiology reviewers. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation in each arm was disease progression (BTH1677, 45.9%; Control, 41.9%).</p><p>Patient demographics and disease characteristics at baseline are shown in Table 1. The BTH1677 and Control arms were similar with respect to age, sex, race, as well as time from initial tumor diagnosis to diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to randomization. The percentage of patients with ECOG PS status of 1 vs 0 was higher in the BTH1677 arm (47.5%) than in the Control arm (33.3%).

Table 6 summarizes the PK parameters of BTH1677 from Cycle 1/Day 1 (n = 53) and Cycle 3/Day 1 ( n = 42). Geometric mean Cmax of serum BTH1677 was similar in Cycle 1 (49.77 μg/mL) and Cycle 3 (60.50 μg/mL).

There were significant increases found in the RMD group at Week 1, 2, and 3 (31, 32, 56 %; p &lt; 0.006, p &lt; 0.006, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively) compared to baseline, while in the placebo group there were no changes found during intervention (Table 3). Furthermore, there was a significant time-by-treatment interaction observed in stool volume (p = 0.014). Based on the Bristol Scale Score self-recorded, a significant increase (softer and better stool consistency) was observed in the RMD group after 3 weeks (21.4 %, p &lt; 0.01) compared to baseline. No change was observed in the placebo group for the stool consistency. Regarding the total number of Rome III positive criteria, there were significant reductions in both RMD and placebo groups (p &lt; 0.01 each).<table-wrap><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Change in stool volume and stool consistency for each group during 3-week intervention</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Baseline</th><th>Week 1</th><th>Week 2</th><th>Week 3</th><th>p value† time × treatment                                     </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stool volume (cm3/day)</td></tr><tr><td> RMD</td><td>53.4 ± 30.1</td><td>69.9 ± 27.4*</td><td>70.2 ± 27.3*</td><td>83.4 ± 26.6*</td><td>0.014</td></tr><tr><td> (Δ)</td><td></td><td>(16.6 ± 32.9)</td><td>(16.8 ± 31.2)</td><td>(30.0 ± 27.4)##</td></tr><tr><td> Placebo</td><td>56.4 ± 20.6</td><td>59.4 ± 25.0</td><td>64.3 ± 25.1</td><td>65.6 ± 23.8</td></tr><tr><td> (Δ)</td><td></td><td>(3.0 ± 21.4)</td><td>(7.9 ± 24.8)</td><td>(9.2 ± 20.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Stool consistency (score)</td></tr><tr><td> RMD</td><td>2.8 ± 1.2</td><td>3.0 ± 1.0</td><td>3.0 ± 1.2</td><td>3.4 ± 1.0*</td><td>n.s.</td></tr><tr><td> (Δ)</td><td></td><td>(0.3 ± 1.0)</td><td>(0.3 ± 1.2)</td><td>(0.6 ± 0.8)</td></tr><tr><td> Placebo</td><td>2.8 ± 0.8</td><td>3.2 ± 0.8</td><td>3.2 ± 0.7</td><td>3.2 ± 0.5</td></tr><tr><td> (Δ)</td><td></td><td>(0.4 ± 1.0)</td><td>(0.4 ± 0.9)</td><td>(0.4 ± 0.8)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values expressed as mean ± SD (standard deviation</p><p>Δ: change from baseline to each time point; n.s.: no significant                             </p><p>* p &lt; 0.05, intragroup significant difference (Bonferroni)</p><p>†p for time-by-treatment interaction was assessed by a repeated-measures ANOVA                             </p><p>##p &lt; 0.01, intergroup significant differences (ANOVA)                             </p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Interestingly, analysis of the individual Rome III criteria showed that only after intervention with RMD a significant lower number of subjects (compared to baseline) answered positively to 3 out of 6 criteria: “straining” (from 63.6 to 33.3 %; p &lt; 0.025), “sensation of incomplete evacuation” (from 51.5 to 27.3 %; p &lt; 0.003) in at least 25 % of defecations, as well as “fewer than three defecations per week” (from 24.2 to 0.0 %; p &lt; 0.013).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>During the study, six AEs were recorded (2 in placebo and 4 in RMD groups).

      "<abstract><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>To study the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of rising single doses of macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in healthy male subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in seven groups of eight healthy male subjects. Doses of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 and 600 mg or placebo (two subjects per group) were administered. Plasma macitentan and endothelin-1 and serum total bile salt concentrations were measured and analysed non-compartmentally. Plasma and urine were analysed qualitatively for the presence of metabolites and one of these, ACT-132577, was also measured quantitatively in plasma. Standard tolerability measurements were performed throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Macitentan was slowly absorbed and, at a dose of 300 mg, the t1/2 (95% confidence interval, CI) was 17.5 h (14.1, 21.8). The dose-proportionality coefficient β for Cmax (95% CI) was 0.83 (0.79, 0.87) indicating less than dose-proportional pharmacokinetics of macitentan. In plasma, a pharmacologically active oxidative depropyl metabolite, ACT-132577, was found whereas in urine two minor metabolites were detected. The t1/2 of ACT-132577 (95% CI) was 65.6 h (53.1, 80.9). Macitentan dose-dependently increased endothelin-1 concentrations up to 2.2-fold (95% CI 1.4, 2.4) at a dose of 600 mg, but had no consistent effect on total bile salts. Macitentan was well tolerated up to and including a dose of 300 mg, the maximum tolerated dose. Headache, nausea and vomiting were dose-limiting adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pharmacokinetic and tolerability profile of macitentan is consistent with a once-a-day dosing regimen and warrants further investigation in clinical studies.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subjects and tolerability</title><p>Fifty-six healthy male Caucasian subjects (age range: 19–49 years, body weight range: 55.4–98.0 kg) participated in this study and all completed the study as per protocol. A summary of the adverse events reported during the study, including those adverse events judged to be unrelated to study medication, is provided in Table 1. No unexpected adverse events, signs of oedema and/or serious adverse events were reported and all events resolved without sequelae. Up to and including a dose of 300 mg, the adverse event profile of macitentan did not significantly differ from that of placebo, whereas more adverse events than in the placebo group were reported at a dose of 600 mg. In this latter dose group, 5 out of 6 subjects reported headache of moderate intensity, accompanied by nausea and vomiting in 2 subjects. Two cases of increased alanine aminotransferase to about 2 times the upper limit of normal or less were observed: in a subject who had received 600 mg of macitentan and the other in a subject who had received placebo. Both cases occurred 7 days after drug administration, whereas 48 h after administration liver enzymes were normal. In neither subject was a significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase noted, nor were there any changes in total bile salt concentrations. There were no clinically significant drug-related effects on vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory variables. <table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of reported adverse events by treatment</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Adverse event</th><th>Treatment (mg macitentan)</th></tr><tr><th>0.2</th><th>1</th><th>5</th><th>25</th><th>100</th><th>300</th><th>600</th><th>Placebo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headache</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Back pain</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hepatic function abnormal</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Nausea</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Rhinitis</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Vomiting</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Abdominal pain</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Flushing</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leukocytosis</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Nasopharyngitis</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Neck pain</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Number of subjects reporting adverse events after having received macitentan (n = 6 per dose) or placebo (n = 14)</p><p>Adverse events reported more than once by the same subject were counted once</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title>\n",

      "The mean plasma concentration–time profiles and the pharmacokinetic variables of macitentan and its main metabolite are shown in Fig. 2, and Tables 2 and 3. Under fasting conditions, macitentan was absorbed slowly with a median tmax varying from 8 to 30 h for the different dose groups. After attainment of Cmax, plasma concentrations decreased slowly. The apparent terminal half-life could only be reliably estimated for the two higher dose groups and was about 16 h. The pharmacokinetics of macitentan showed a less than dose-proportional increase for Cmax as indicated by a value for the dose proportionality coefficient β (95% CI) of 0.83 (0.79, 0.87). Formation of the depropyl metabolite was slow with maximum concentrations attained at least 30 h after dosing (Fig. 2, Table 3). In comparison to the parent compound, plasma concentrations of the metabolite were higher and elimination was slower as demonstrated by mean t1/2 values varying from 40.2 to 65.6 h. This resulted in a total exposure (AUC0−∞) to the metabolite that was 2.7-fold (95% CI 2.5, 2.9) greater than that to macitentan at a dose of 600 mg. <fig><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Arithmetic mean plasma concentration–time profiles of macitentan (top panel) and ACT-132577 (bottom panel) in healthy subjects (n = 6 per group except for 600 mg dose where n = 5) after administration of a single dose of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 or 600 mg of macitentan</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><table-wrap><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Pharmacokinetic variables of macitentan in healthy subjects after administration of a single dose of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 and 600 mg of macitentan</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Dose (mg)</th><th>n</th><th>Cmax (ng/ml)</th><th>tmax (h)</th><th>AUC0–48 (ng.h/ml)</th><th>AUC0−∞ (ng.h/ml)</th><th>t1/2 (h)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0.2</td><td>6</td><td>4.0 (2.6 to 6.2)</td><td>8 (8–12)</td><td>85.9 (52.4 to 141)</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>17.9 (12.4 to 25.9)</td><td>8 (4–10)</td><td>439 (271 to 711)</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>93.4 (79.1 to 110)</td><td>8 (4–8)</td><td>2056 (1,855 to 2,278)</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>6</td><td>335 (264 to 425)</td><td>8 (4–30)</td><td>8,810 (7,412 to 10,472)</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>6</td><td>999 (643 to 1552)</td><td>8 (4–12)</td><td>25,281 (18,775 to 34,040)</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>300</td><td>6</td><td>1,847 (1,409 to 2,422)</td><td>30 (10–48)</td><td>67,109 (48,751 to 92,380)</td><td>103,007 (76,650 to 138,428)</td><td>17.5 (14.1 to 21.8)</td></tr><tr><td>600</td><td>5*</td><td>2,967 (2,233 to 3,943)</td><td>12 (8–30)</td><td>96,530 (70,006 to 133,102)</td><td>127,104 (82,657 to 195,450)</td><td>13.4 (11.3 to 15.9)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are expressed as geometric means (and 95% CI) or for tmax the median (and range)</p><p>ND = not determined because t1/2 could not be reliably assessed</p><p>*One subject was excluded from the descriptive statistics because of an atypical plasma concentration–time profile</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>\n",

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Internet research may raise older ethical issues in new forms or pose new issues. It has been recommended that debriefing information online be kept very short, with further information including study results made available if requested by participants. There are no empirical studies that compare possible alternative methods of debriefing in online studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To undertake a randomized controlled trial evaluating how to implement the recommended approach by assessing the effects of two different approaches on accessing of additional information.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>All 11,943 participants in the Effects of Study Design and Allocation (ESDA) study, which employed deception, were randomly assigned to one of two methods of debriefing: Group A received the debriefing information in the body of an email with links to protocol and results pages; Group B was presented with these links after clicking on an initial link in the body of the email to view the debriefing information on a website. Outcomes assessed were the proportions clicking on the links to the protocol and results summary and the time spent on these pages by those accessing them.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The group who were presented with no debriefing information in the body of the email and went to a website for this information (Group B) were approximately twice as likely to subsequently access the protocol and the results summary.

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Etoricoxib is a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor which was evaluated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Double-blind, randomized, placebo and active comparator-controlled, 12-week study conducted at 67 sites in 28 countries. Eligible patients were chronic NSAID users who demonstrated a clinical worsening of arthritis upon withdrawal of prestudy NSAIDs. Patients received either placebo, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily, or naproxen 500 mg twice daily (2:2:1 allocation ratio). Primary efficacy measures included direct assessment of arthritis by counts of tender and swollen joints, and patient and investigator global assessments of disease activity. Key secondary measures included the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, patient global assessment of pain, and the percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response (a composite of pain, inflammation, function, and global assessments). Tolerability was assessed by adverse events and routine laboratory evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>1171 patients were screened, 891 patients were randomized (N = 357 for placebo, N = 353 for etoricoxib, and N = 181 for naproxen), and 687 completed 12 weeks of treatment (N = 242 for placebo, N = 294 for etoricoxib, and N = 151 for naproxen). Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving etoricoxib and naproxen showed significant improvements in all efficacy endpoints (p&lt;0.05). Treatment responses were similar between the etoricoxib and naproxen groups for all endpoints. The percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response was 41% in the placebo group, 59% in the etoricoxib group, and 58% in the naproxen group. Etoricoxib and naproxen were both generally well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily was more effective than placebo and similar in efficacy to naproxen 500 mg twice daily for treating patients with RA over 12 weeks.

Baseline characteristics of the 891 patients in the 3 treatment groups were similar and are shown in Table 1. A total of 687 of the 891 patients (67.8% of the placebo group, 83.3% of the etoricoxib group, and 83.4% of the naproxen group) completed the 12-week study (Figure 1). The mean number of days patients were on treatment was 65.5 for placebo, 76.0 for etoricoxib, and 76.5 for naproxen. The most common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy, and significantly more patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy in the placebo group than in the etoricoxib and naproxen group (25.2%, 12.5%, 10.5%, respectively, p&lt;0.001 vs placebo). The results of all patients who had at least one post-randomization efficacy measurement were included in the primary analysis of efficacy (93.0% in the placebo group, 97.5% in the etoricoxib group and 96.1% in the naproxen group).</p><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study flowchart.

For all 4 primary endpoints, etoricoxib and naproxen were statistically superior to placebo. For all secondary endpoints, except serum C-reactive protein, both etoricoxib and naproxen were also superior to placebo. Serum C-reactive protein levels increased on etoricoxib compared to placebo. This was not seen in the naproxen group. There was no significant difference between etoricoxib and naproxen for any of the primary or secondary endpoints. The percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response was 40.9% in the placebo group, 58.7% in the etoricoxib group, and 57.5% in the naproxen group. Treatment effects of etoricoxib were rapid, occurring at the earliest time point measured (week 2), and were maintained over the entire 12-week study period (Figures 2a,2b,2c,2d).

The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 ± 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7–14 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain.

Request form errors include any error in the completion of the request form such as no patient details indicated, illegible requests, name on sample tube and request form unmatched, no test requested or an unlabelled sample. Unaccountable preanalytical errors include all errors that are not accounted for by the above but that occur in the preanalytical phase of laboratory testing of blood samples. These include samples with missing reasons for rejection, samples older than 3 days, samples that leaked in transit as well as samples that were not received by the laboratory.</p><p>Table 3 shows a detailed summary of rejection rates and related reasons by facility.

In general, PRO responses were in agreement with clinical responses as determined by either improvements in RA signs and symptoms (ACR20 response rates) or decrease in disease activity (DAS28 scores; Table 3). As expected, classification of response according to physical function and pain was highly correlated with ACR20 response rates, with 88.8% and 93.6% of patients treated with CZP 200 mg plus MTX being classified the same by physical function/ACR20 and pain/ACR20, respectively. Correlations between fatigue and ACR20 responses were also high (90.0%) as were those between patient's global assessment of disease activity (98.0%), while changes in HRQoL (SF-36 PCS and MCS scores) had the lowest correlation with ACR20 responses (84.3% and 77.4%, respectively).</p><table-wrap><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>PRO response by clinical response* at week 52 (CZP 200 mg plus MTX group, ITT population)</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>ACR20 response by (%)</th></tr><tr><th></th><th></th><th><hr/></th></tr><tr><th></th><th></th><th>SF-36 PCS</th><th>SF-36 MCS</th><th>HAQ-DI</th><th>Pain</th><th>FAS</th><th>PtGA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Clinical response</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>PRO response</td><td>No</td><td>45.5</td><td>14.7</td><td>43.4</td><td>19.5</td><td>44.4</td><td>8.7</td><td>44.4</td><td>3.8</td><td>44.1</td><td>7.1</td><td>86.9</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Yes</td><td>1.0</td><td>38.8</td><td>3.1</td><td>33.9</td><td>2.6</td><td>44.4</td><td>1.0</td><td>38.2</td><td>2.8</td><td>45.9</td><td>0</td><td>11.1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tetrachoric correlation (ASE)</td><td>0.9450 (0.0178)</td><td>0.8389 (0.0356)</td><td>0.9504 (0.0152)</td><td>0.9804 (0.0076)</td><td>0.9574 (0.0135)</td><td>0.9996 (0.0053)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>DAS response by (%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><hr/></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>SF-36 PCS</td><td>SF-36 MCS</td><td>HAQ-DI</td><td>Pain</td><td>FAS</td><td>PtGA</td></tr><tr><td><hr/></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clinical response</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>PRO response</td><td>No</td><td>44.2</td><td>16.5</td><td>43.2</td><td>20.4</td><td>43.6</td><td>10.0</td><td>43.6</td><td>5.1</td><td>43.9</td><td>7.7</td><td>44.1</td><td>4.9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Yes</td><td>1.0</td><td>38.2</td><td>2.1</td><td>34.4</td><td>2.1</td><td>44.4</td><td>2.1</td><td>49.2</td><td>1.8</td><td>46.7</td><td>1.5</td><td>49.5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tetrachoric correlation (ASE)</td><td>0.9344 (0.0204)</td><td>0.8674 (0.0322)</td><td>0.9496 (0.0156)</td><td>0.9776 (0.0085)</td><td>0.9672 (0.0114)</td><td>0.9833 (0.0069)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Clinical response = DAS or ACR20 response.</p><p>ACR20 = American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement; ASE = asymptomatic standard error; CZP = certolizumab pegol; DAS = disease activity score; FAS = fatigue assessment scale; HAQ-DI = health assessment questionnaire-disability index; ITT = intent to treat; MCS = mental component summary; MTX = methotrexate; PtGA = patient's global assessment; PCS = physical component summary; PRO = patient-reported outcomes; SF-36 = short-form 36-item health survey</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Results were similar for correlations between PRO responses and DAS28 responses, with SF-36 PCS and MCS scores showing the lowest correlations with DAS28 responses (82.4% and 77.6%, respectively) and physical function, fatigue, pain and global assessment of disease activity showing the highest correlations (88.0%, 90.6%, 92.8% and 93.6%, respectively).</p></sec>\n",

      "<abstract><p>Vitamin D deficiency was common among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and had negative influence on treatment outcome. Correction of vitamin D deficiency improved treatment response. Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) involved in inflammatory responses in CHC. Their higher levels at pretreatment of CHC could predict poorer responses. Vitamin D suppressed expression of IP-10 from monocytes in vitro. In CHC patients, DPP IV involved in IP-10 regulation. We hypothesized that correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in CHC patients might restore immune dysregulation through a pathway linked to the TH1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 or DPP IV. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 80 CHC patients with vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were assigned to receive vitamin D (40) or placebo (40) supplements for 6 weeks. The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], Th1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 and DPP IV were measured at baseline and at the 6th week. At the end of study, the mean 25(OH)D level in vitamin D group was significantly increased and normalised. There were no changes in the level of Th1/Th2 cytokines. Our important finding revealed that upon correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, the serum IP-10 and DPP IV levels were decreased significantly as compare to the placebo group (delta changes; 83.27 vs -133.80; 95% CI [-326.910, -40.758], p = 0.0125, and 271.04 vs -518.69; 95% CI [-1179,15, -59.781], p = 0.0305, respectively. As previous evidences suggested that each factor individually influenced and predicted outcome of CHC treatment. Our results offer a new insight and help to piece the puzzle of vitamin D deficiency, IP-10 and DPP IV together in CHC.</p><p>Trial registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry TCTR20160429001</p></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Study patients at baseline</title><p>From January to December 2014, 80 patients were included into this study and randomly assigned to receive a placebo (n = 40) vitamin D supplement (n = 40). 42 patients were naïve cases without previous CHC treatment and 38 patients were previously failed therapy either relapsers or non-responders.

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Concern that mild iodine deficiency in pregnancy may adversely affect neurodevelopment of offspring has led to recommendations for iodine supplementation in the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the effect of iodine supplementation during pregnancy on childhood neurodevelopment. Secondary outcomes included pregnancy outcomes, maternal thyroid function and general health.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Women with a singleton pregnancy of fewer than 20 weeks were randomly assigned to iodine (150 μg/d) or placebo from trial entry to birth. Childhood neurodevelopment was assessed at 18 months by using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III). Iodine status and thyroid function were assessed at baseline and at 36 weeks’ gestation. Pregnancy outcomes were collected from medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The trial was stopped after 59 women were randomly assigned following withdrawal of support by the funding body. There were no differences in childhood neurodevelopmental scores between the iodine treated and placebo groups. The mean cognitive, language and motor scores on the Bayley-III (iodine versus placebo, respectively) were 99.4 ± 12.2 versus 101.7 ± 8.2 (mean difference (MD) −2.3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) −7.8, 3.2;  P = 0.42), 97.2 ± 12.2 versus 97.9 ± 11.5 (MD −0.7, 95 % CI −7.0, 5.6;  P = 0.83) and 93.9 ± 10.8 versus 92.4 ± 9.7 (MD 1.4, 95 % CI −4.0, 6.9; P = 0.61), respectively. No differences were identified between groups in any secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Iodine supplementation in pregnancy did not result in better childhood neurodevelopment in this small trial. Adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed to provide conclusive evidence regarding the effect of iodine supplementation in pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trials registration</title><p>The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry at <ext-link>http://www.anzctr.org.au</ext-link>. The registration number of this trial is <ext-link>ACTRN12610000411044</ext-link>. The trial was registered on 21 May 2010.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><p>Of the 645 women approached, 205 met the eligibility criteria. A total of 59 out of 205 (29 %) women were enrolled in the study from the Women’s &amp; Children’s Hospital and the Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide, Australia, between June 2010 and October 2010 (Fig. 1). Twenty-nine were randomly allocated to iodine and 30 to placebo (Fig. 1). The baseline demographic characteristics of the participants are listed in Table 1. The trial was stopped early, before recruitment began in other Australian centres and New Zealand, because the funding body (NHMRC) withdrew its support for the trial. The NHMRC considered a placebo-controlled trial inconsistent with its recommendation for iodine supplementation in pregnancy. The ethics committees did not withdraw approval for the trial, but in view of the funding body’s position it supported the trial management committee’s decision to unblind the study and to follow all randomly assigned women as planned to monitor safety. Women were informed of their treatment group allocation and were provided with a copy of the NHMRC recommendation for iodine supplementation in pregnancy [9]. All women except two (one from each group) consented to continue with the follow-up after unblinding. The mean gestational age at unblinding was 33 ± 7 weeks. The mean duration of intervention before unblinding was 16 weeks (range 2–23 weeks). Nine (31 %) women in the iodine group and 4 (13 %) in the placebo group gave birth before unblinding. The decision regarding whether to continue taking trial supplements or to take commercially available iodine supplements was at the women’s discretion. Five women in the iodine group and 18 in the placebo group stopped taking trial supplements. Only one woman in the placebo group commenced iodine supplements after unblinding.<fig><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant flowchart</p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline demographic characteristics</p></caption><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Iodine (n = 29)</th><th>Placebo (n = 30)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age at trial entry, yearsa</td><td>29.1 (5.7)</td><td>29.8 (5.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Gestational age at trial entry, weeksa</td><td>15.2 (2.6)</td><td>14.9 (2.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Primiparousb</td><td>13 (44.8)</td><td>13 (43.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Completed secondary educationb</td><td>20 (69.0)</td><td>22 (73.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Completed further educationb</td><td>22 (75.9)</td><td>24 (80.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Smoke at trial entry or leading up to pregnancyb</td><td>7 (24.1)</td><td>5 (16.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Miscarriage in previous pregnancyb</td><td>8 (27.6)</td><td>12 (40.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Previous or current depressionb</td><td>4 (13.8)</td><td>7 (23.3)</td></tr><tr><td>BMI at trial entrya</td><td>25.3 (5.9)</td><td>23.6 (3.9)</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-pregnancy BMIa</td><td>23.6 (5.5)</td><td>22.2 (4.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Infant sex: maleb</td><td>20 (71.4)</td><td>9 (31.0)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>BMI body mass index</p><p>aData are presented as mean (standard deviation)</p><p>bData are presented as number (percentage)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>\n",

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Since the first facial allograft transplantation was performed, several institutions have performed the procedure with the main objectives being restoration of the aesthetic appearance and expressive function of the face. The optimal location to transect the facial nerve during flap harvest in transplantation to preserve facial movement function is currently unknown. There are currently two primary methods to perform facial nerve neurorrhaphy between the donor and recipient-one protocol involves transection and repair of the facial nerve at the main trunk while the another protocol advocates for the neurorrhaphy to be performed distally at the main branches. The purpose of this study is to establish the optimal location for transection and repair of the facial nerve to optimize functional recovery of facial movement.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective randomized controlled trial using a rat model was performed. Two groups of 12 rats underwent facial nerve transection and subsequent repair either at the main trunk of the nerve (group 1) or 2 cm distally, at the main bifurcation (group 2). Primary outcome of nerve functional recovery was measured using a previously validated laser curtain model, which measured amplitude of whisking at 2, 4, and 6 post-operatively. The deflection of the laser curtain sent a digital signal that was interpreted by central computer software.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At week 2 post-nerve surgery, the average amplitude observed for group 1 and 2 was 4.4 and 10.8 degrees, respectively.

      "<abstract><p>Background. In view of the adverse effects of using restraints, studies examining the use of restraint reduction programs (RRPs) are needed. Objectives. To investigate the effect of an RRP on the reduction of physical restraint rates in rehabilitation hospitals. Methods. A prospective quasi-experimental clinical trial was conducted. Demographic data, medical and health-related information on recruited patients from two rehabilitation hospitals, as well as facility data on restraint rates were collected. Results. The increase in the restraint rate in the control site was 4.3 times greater than that in the intervention site. Changes in the restraint mode, from continuous to intermittent, and the type of restraint used were found between the pre- and postintervention periods in both the control site and the intervention site. Discussion. Compared with that in the control site, the RRP in the intervention site helped arrest any increase in the restraint rate although it had no effect on physical restraint reduction. The shift of restraint mode from continuous to intermittent in the intervention site was one of the positive outcomes of the RRP. </p></abstract><title>3. Results</title><p>The samples in the two hospitals were first compared in terms of their demographic and clinical characteristics. The preintervention sample at the intervention facility was considerably older—mean age 75.4 (SD 10.7) versus 59.1 (SD 17.4) of the control facility (P &lt; 0.001). The two samples were different in terms of the number of medical diagnosis, with the study site having a mean of 3.1 diagnoses (SD 1.5) versus the control site's mean of 1.8 diagnoses (SD 1.2) (P &lt; 0.001); the mean MMSE score of the study site was 16.7 (SD 7.0) versus control site's 25.4 (SD 5.3) (P &lt; 0.001); the mean MBI score was 12.7 (SD 5.5) in the study site versus control site's mean 15.1 score (SD 3.2) (P &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences found in all the other clinical and demographic variables.</p><p>The postintervention sample at the study site remained considerably older, with a mean age of 74.8 (SD 10.6) versus 62.9 (SD 17.7) in the control site (P &lt; 0.001). Again, the two samples were different in terms of the number of medical diagnosis, with the study site having a mean of 3.2 diagnoses (SD 1.5) versus control site's mean of 1.9 diagnoses (SD 1.2) (P &lt; 0.001); the mean MMSE score of the study site was 16.4 (SD 7.2) versus control site's 24.4 (SD 6.5) (P &lt; 0.001); the mean MBI score of the study site was 12.0 (SD 5.1) versus control site's mean 15.1 (SD 3.4) (P &lt; 0.001). The two facilities were also significantly different in terms of their gender composition—49.0% males in the study site versus 34.8% males in the control site. No other significant differences were found in clinical and demographic variables between the two hospital samples in the post-intervention period.</p><p>Then the baseline sample profile of the patients before the intervention in the study and control site were compared (Tables 1(a) and 1(b)). The control site had a significantly younger patient group than the study site (P &lt; 0.001) in the nonrestrained patient group. This younger patient group probably resulted in the higher cognitive status as reflected in the significantly higher mean MMSE total score (P &lt; 0.001) and the lower risk of fall as reflected in the lower Morse Fall Scale score (P &lt; 0.001) (Table 1(a)). Restrained patients had a similar sample profile in both the study and control sites. However, significant differences were found in age (P &lt; 0.01) in both the nonrestrained and restrained groups of patients between the study and control sites. A significant difference in the experiences of falling in hospital (P &lt; 0.01) was also found in the nonrestrained patients (Table 1(b)). </p><p>Last, the profiles of those who were restrained and nonrestrained were compared in each of the study sites. Tables 2(a) and 2(b) provide information about the categorical variables of the samples recruited during the pre- and postintervention period in both sites. Significant differences were found in the MBI score (P = 0.016) and vision (P &lt; 0.001) in the study site in the postintervention period when compared with the preintervention period. The mean MBI score was worse (30.3 versus 31.5) while there were more people with normal vision (39.2% versus 51.2%) after intervention.</p><p>For the control site, there were significant differences in the age (P = 0.039) and the Morse fall scale (P &lt; 0.001) in the postintervention when compared with the pre-intervention phase. The mean age was older (59.1 versus 62.9) and the mean MFS score (20.7 versus 30.3) showed a slightly higher risk post-intervention.</p><p>To answer the primary research question of whether a reduction in restraint rates had been attained in the post-intervention period, the prevalence of restraint was calculated. In the control site, the overall restraint rate (including both intermittent and continuous) significantly increased from 2.6 to 8.3% (P &lt; 0.000). Both intermittent and continuous use of restraint were significantly increased in the postintervention period, with intermittent restraint use increasing from 0.2 to 3.3% (P &lt; 0.001) and continuous restraint use increasing from 2.4 to 5% (P &lt; 0.001) (Table 3). </p><p>In the study site, there was no significant difference in the overall restraint rate between the pre- and postintervention periods although the overall restraint rate had a slightly upward trend from 11.5% to 13.6% (P = 0.405) postintervention.

      "<p>We analyzed the subsample recruited into the RRC (those complex cases who were brought to the multidisciplinary team for discussion about their progress). In this subsample, we found that there was a significant increase of patients with their restraints taken off after RRC conference (0% versus 18.2%, P = 0.014). There was an insignificant but slight increase of intermittent restraint (from 14.5% to 18.2%, P = 0.317), and there was a significant decrease of continuous restraint after RRC conference (from 85.5% to 63.6%, P = 0.009). These data provided further evidence that there was a positive direction of changes in practice in the intervention site. There was a significant increase in the use of bedrails and lap tables and a significant decrease in the use of waist belts and jackets after intervention in the control site. The bed rail was the most common type of restraint (61.9%), followed by the jacket restraint and waist belt (both at 14.3%), with lap tables as the least common (9.5%) after intervention.</p><p>In the study site, there was a decrease in the use of lap tables (from 48.0% to 39.2%) after intervention, but at the same time, there was an increase in the use of bed rails (43.3% to 51.8%) at the study site (Table 2(b)). Bed rail was the most common type of restraint, followed by lap table (39.2%) and jacket restraint (8.6%) in the postintervention period.</p><p>Because any increase or decrease in physical restraint use may imply a concomitant change in the use of chemical restraint, the subjects' use of psychotropic medications were also examined. No significant differences were found in the use of psychotropic medications in the study site (P = 0.346) and the control site (P = 0.075) comparing pre- and postintervention data. Both sites had a low rate in the use of psychotropic drugs to begin with and remained as such after intervention. In the study site, only 3.3% of the subjects were prescribed psychotropic medications before intervention, and 2.3% were prescribed psychotropic drugs after intervention. In the control site, 2% of the subjects were on psychotropic medications, and none were prescribed (0%) after intervention. </p><p>The staff profiles were examined to see if there might be the possibility of impacting on the study outcomes. In the intervention site, the staff response rate in the preintervention survey was 82.2% (N = 97) and 77.4% after intervention (N = 89). No significant differences were found in their gender (P = 0.535), years of clinical experience (P = 0.684), with or without on-the-job training about restraint use (P = 0.179) pre- and post-intervention. Also, no significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (P = 0.147), attitude (P = 0.071), and practice (P = 0.139) before and after intervention using Janelli et al.'s (1991) validated questionnaire. When further analysis were conducted, a subsample of nurses (of one unit) were found to have better knowledge after intervention (mean score results: 5.51 versus 6.23, P = 0.04).</p><p>In the control site, the staff response rate before intervention was 51.5% (N = 17) and 77.8% after intervention (N = 28). No significant differences were found in their gender (P = 0.431), years of clinical experience (P = 0.516), and with or without on the job training about restraint use (P = 0.948). Moreover, no significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (P = 0.436) and attitude (P = 0.498). There was, however, a significant decrease in their practice score (from 38.41 to 36.43, P = 0.048). The problematic practice behaviors included item C7 (I tell family members why the patient is being restrained), C8 (I explain to the patient why the restraint is being applied), and C9 (I tell the patient when the restraint will be removed). </p><p>When comparing nursing staff samples of between the study and control sites, there were no significant differences observed in their gender distribution (before intervention: P = 0.279 and after intervention: P = 0.348), years of clinical experience (before intervention: P = 0.369; after intervention: P = 0.055), and with or without on the job training about restraint use (before intervention: P = 0.153; after intervention: P = 0.176). No significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (P = 0.230) and attitude (P = 0.986). However, there was a significant difference in their mean practice score (38.41 versus 36.43, P = 0.037), with the control site having relatively poorer scores.</p>\n",

The experimental group completed a 10-week yoga program prescribed three sessions per week during lunch hour (50 min per session). An experienced instructor led the sessions, which emphasized asanas (postures) and vinyasa (exercises). The primary outcome was the high frequency (HF) power component of HRV. Secondary outcomes included additional HRV parameters, musculoskeletal fitness (i.e. push-up, side-bridge, and sit &amp; reach tests) and psychological indices (i.e. state and trait anxiety, quality of life and job satisfaction).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All measures of HRV failed to change in the experimental group versus the control group, except that the experimental group significantly increased LF:HF (p = 0.04) and reduced pNN50 (p = 0.04) versus control, contrary to our hypotheses. Flexibility, evaluated via sit &amp; reach test increased in the experimental group versus the control group (p &lt; 0.001). No other adaptations were noted. Post hoc analysis comparing participants who completed ≥70% of yoga sessions (n = 11) to control (n = 19) yielded the same findings, except that the high adherers also reduced state anxiety (p = 0.02) and RMSSD (p = 0.05), and tended to improve the push-up test (p = 0.07) versus control.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A 10-week hatha yoga intervention delivered at the office worksite during lunch hour did not improve HF power or other HRV parameters. However, improvements in flexibility, state anxiety and musculoskeletal fitness were noted with high adherence. Future investigations should incorporate strategies to promote adherence, involve more frequent and longer durations of yoga training, and enrol cohorts who suffer from higher levels of work-related stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link>ACTRN12611000536965</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Flow of participants</title><p>Forty-two individuals (n = 42) expressed an interest in the study, and were deemed eligible; five withdrew prior to baseline testing with reasons presented in Figure 1. Thirty-seven individuals provided written informed consent, completed baseline testing, and were randomized to the yoga (n = 18) or control group (n = 19). One participant in the yoga group withdrew in week 2 for personal reasons, while two in the control group failed to complete follow-up testing. Recruitment resulted in lower participant interest and enrolment than anticipated [22], and therefore our a priori calculation of statistical power was reduced from 80% to 63%.</p><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow of participants. * Baseline data carried forward for 1 yoga and 2 control participants lost to follow-up. </p></caption><graphic></graphic></fig></sec>\n",

No statistically significant differences were observed between groups at baseline on the descriptive characteristics presented. However, due to potentially clinically important differences in BMI (p = 0.09), this variable was included as a covariate in all ANCOVA models. The cohort ranged in age from 21 to 58 years. BMI ranged from 18.3 to 39.2 kg/m2, and seven participants fulfilled the clinical criteria for obesity (i.e. BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2). Two participants were current smokers, while one had a history of tobacco use but did not currently smoke. Other than obesity, the most common chronic conditions were asthma (n = 4), hypercholesterolemia (n = 4) and hypertension (n = 5). None of the participants were presently engaged in regular yoga practice but nearly half had prior experience at a beginner level (17/37, 46%).

Gemcitabine undergoes intracellular conversion, from 2′,2′-difluoro 2′-deoxycytidine (dFdC) to the active triphosphate form 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP), responsible for inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. To directly measure drug delivery, dFdCTP levels were analyzed in PC tumors of KPP mice after continuous 10-day HhAntag treatment and a single dose of gemcitabine. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that dFdCTP concentrations were similar in both vehicle- and HhAntag-treated KPP mice (Fig 4C; Mann-Whitney P = 1.00). Intracellular gemcitabine is also converted to an inactivated form, diflurodeoxyuridine (dFdU). The ratio of the unprocessed form (dFdC) to inactive form (dFdU) estimates intratumoral gemcitabine exposure. The average ratio of dFdC to dFdU in KPP tumors of HhAntag-treated mice was not significantly different between vehicle and SMO inhibitor groups (Fig 4D; P = .48).

In the aripiprazole group, EPS-related AEs were observed in 2 (4.3%) patients (salivary hypersecretion) or 1 (2.1%) patient each (akathisia, gait disturbance, bradykinesia, lisp and tremor). One patient in the aripiprazole group experienced salivary hypersecretion, gait disturbance, bradykinesia, lisp and tremor. One (2.2%) patient in the placebo group experienced salivary hypersecretion as EPS. The severity of all observed EPS-related AEs were considered mild in both groups. Mean serum prolactin concentrations at baseline were 16.7 ng/mL for placebo and 14.3 ng/mL for aripiprazole. Aripiprazole was associated with a significant decrease in serum prolactin concentrations compared with placebo from baseline to week 8 (−13.8 vs −2.0 ng/mL; p &lt; 0.001). No patient in the aripiprazole group experienced increase in serum prolactin concentrations. Sedation was reported as an AE in 2.1% (n = 1) of the aripiprazole group and no patients in the placebo group. Increased appetite was reported as an AE in 4.3% (n = 2) of the aripiprazole group and 2.2% (n = 1) in the placebo group.

However, the mean change in weight from baseline to week 8 was not significantly different between aripiprazole and placebo (1.24 vs 0.58 kg; p = 0.085). The mean change in BMI from baseline to week 8 was significantly different between aripiprazole and placebo (0.40 versus 0.03 kg/m 2 ; p = 0.035). After treatment, the incidence rates of total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dL were: placebo, 9.1% and aripiprazole, 17.0%. No patients experienced fasting blood glucose ≥115 mg/dL, non-fasting blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL, fasting triglyceride ≥200 mg/dL, non-fasting triglyceride ≥500 mg/dL. No marked abnormalities were observed in the other clinical laboratory tests along with vital sign assessments and the 12-lead ECG, except for the decrease in serum prolactin concentrations in the aripiprazole group as described above.

We tested if temporal neck cooling with a wet towel and fanning has beneficial effects on cognitive function during strenuous exercise with a short duration in a hot environment. The main finding of this study was that temporal neck cooling did not attenuate the detrimental effects on cognitive function during strenuous exercise in a hot environment. The present finding suggests that temporal neck cooling with a wet towel and fanning is not effective enough to attenuate cognitive impairment during strenuous exercise with a short duration in a warm and humid environment.</p><p>We assessed cognitive function using the combination of spatial DR task and Go/No-Go task. The Spatial DR task requires working memory [25, 29]. The Go/No-Go task requires executive function, including selective attention, response inhibition and interference control [30, 31]. The prefrontal and parietal cortices play a key role in spatial working memory [32–35]. Activation in the prefrontal cortex is crucial for executive function [36, 37]. Furthermore, the frontopolar cortex, which is located at the most anterior part of the frontal cortex, is selectively activated in multi-tasking where execution of the primary task was maintained in a pending state while performing a secondary task [38]. Given that the present cognitive task was a modified version of multi-tasking, the present cognitive task required activation of the frontopolar cortex. Taken together, we can assume that the present cognitive task was appropriate to assess higher cognitive function in humans.</p><p>In the present study, HR was maintained at 160 beats/min during exercise. Indeed, RPE was approximately 16 immediately after the cognitive tasks during exercise. Furthermore, blood lactate concentration increased above 5 mmol/l after exercise in both conditions. Hence, in the present study, we can assume that exercise intensity was classified as strenuous.</p><p>Skin cooling may reduce thermal strain and/or discomfort at rest and during exercise [5, 9–13]. Thus, physiological as well as psychological changes induced by skin cooling may somehow attenuate the impairment in cognitive function during exercise in a hot environment. Previous studies indicated that head and neck cooling with frozen packs prevented the impairment of short-term memory [14, 39]. In the present study, the accuracy of the cognitive task decreased during exercise in the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions. We observed no differences in the accuracy of the cognitive task during exercise between conditions. These results suggest that temporal neck cooling for a short period did not have beneficial effects on cognitive function during exercise in a hot environment under the present condition. In the present study, while neck cooling temporarily decreased skin temperature, neck cooling did not alter body temperature. These results mean that the neck cooling applied in this study was not effective enough to decrease body temperature. The present results are in line with the findings showing that skin cooling did not reduce body temperature [9–11, 40]. Moreover, we found no differences in RPE between conditions. Therefore, the lack of beneficial effects of temporal neck cooling on cognitive function would be ascribed to that physiological and/or psychological changes induced by brief neck cooling was not sufficient enough to attenuate the detrimental effects on cognitive function.</p><p>Dehydration is one of the potential factors that may impair cognitive function in a hot environment. Hence, we used strenuous exercise with a short duration. We expected that severe dehydration is unlikely to occur even in a hot environment in the present study. Indeed, weight reduction was less than 0.5% in the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions. Previous studies suggested that dehydration may impair complex cognitive tasks when weight reduction was greater than 2% [21, 22, 39]. Indeed, Gaoua et al. [39] suggested that, when weight reduction did not exceed 0.5%, fluid replacement is adequate and dehydration does not alter cognitive function. Hence, we can assume that the effects of dehydration on cognitive function were negligible in the present study.</p><p>In contrast to the accuracy of the cognitive task, reaction time in the Go-trial was not altered by exercise. These results suggest that the effects of strenuous exercise in a hot environment are different between accuracy and speed of response. Previous studies indicated that nerve conduction velocity increases in the hot environment [14, 39]. Thus, exercise in a hot environment may increase in nerve conduction velocity, which leads to the decrease in reaction time. However, in the present study, it is unclear whether reaction time was not affected by strenuous exercise or whether increases in conduction velocity in a hot environment was not effective, possibly due to a short duration of exercise. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that increases in nerve conduction velocity compensated for the negative effects of strenuous exercise on speed of response. Provided that multiple factors are responsible for changes in response speed during exercise, further studies will be required to elucidate these points.</p><p>It has been suggested that increase in arousal level induced by exercise affect cognitive function [41, 42]. From this viewpoint, the present results may suggest that arousal level went beyond the optimal level during strenuous exercise in a hot environment, and that temporal neck cooling was not effective to alter arousal level. However, physiological mechanisms underlying the alterations in arousal level during exercise remains to be elucidated. Thus, further studies are required to understand the association between arousal level and cognitive function.</p></sec>\n",

Patients were monitored for adverse events. Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-HLA panel reactive antibodies (PRA) against class I and II HLAs determined by flow cytometry. Pain, function, and quality of life were assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and SF-36v2 scores.

      "<abstract><p>The World Health Organization recommends that malaria be confirmed by parasitological diagnosis before treatment using Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT). Despite this, many health workers in malaria endemic countries continue to diagnose malaria based on symptoms alone. This study evaluates interventions to help bridge this gap between guidelines and provider practice. A stratified cluster-randomized trial in 42 communities in Enugu state compared 3 scenarios: Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) with basic instruction (control); RDTs with provider training (provider arm); and RDTs with provider training plus a school-based community intervention (provider-school arm). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients treated according to guidelines, a composite indicator requiring patients to be tested for malaria and given treatment consistent with the test result. The primary outcome was evaluated among 4946 (93%) of the 5311 patients invited to participate. A total of 40 communities (12 in control, 14 per intervention arm) were included in the analysis. There was no evidence of differences between the three arms in terms of our composite indicator (p = 0.36): stratified risk difference was 14% (95% CI -8.3%, 35.8%; p = 0.26) in the provider arm and 1% (95% CI -21.1%, 22.9%; p = 0.19) in the provider-school arm, compared with control. The level of testing was low across all arms (34% in control; 48% provider arm; 37% provider-school arm; p = 0.47). Presumptive treatment of uncomplicated malaria remains an ingrained behaviour that is difficult to change. With or without extensive supporting interventions, levels of testing in this study remained critically low. Governments and researchers must continue to explore alternative ways of encouraging providers to deliver appropriate treatment and avoid the misuse of valuable medicines.</p><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link>NCT01350752</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><p>The trial profile is provided in Fig 2. The study took place between 6th June and 19th December 2011. A total of 42 clusters (14 per arm) were randomised and 40 (12 in control, 14 per intervention arm) were included in the analysis. Two clusters in the control arm were not included in the analysis because no patients visited these health facilities. The primary outcome was evaluated among 4946 (93%) of the 5311 patients invited to participate in the study.</p><fig><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0133832.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Trial profile.</title></caption><graphic></graphic></fig><sec><title>Process evaluation</title><p>Of the 137 facilities that were invited and agreed to participate in the trial, 113 (82%; 125 providers) were represented at the RDT demonstration or provider training. Reasons for non-attendance included being too busy, short-staffed, travelling, bereavement, and sickness or death. The training workshops were successfully delivered, with 112/125 (90%) of participants strongly agreeing that they were satisfied with the delivery of the course by the trainers and the relevance of the material to their work. Participants’ knowledge of topics covered in the material increased from 59% to 82% (as measured by the pre-post training test). In the intervention arms 71/79 (90%) facilities received support visits, due to closure of some facilities on the visit days.</p><p>A total of 109 teachers from 59 schools were initially trained on peer health education and holding community events. Teachers from 57 schools subsequently trained 510 children as PHEs. Twenty-seven schools held a malaria event with considerable variation in terms of the range of activities undertaken, attendance (80 to 400 community members) and duration (1 to 4 hours). The evaluation of pre and post tests for training of school teachers showed an increase in knowledge from 12% to 50%.</p><p>Three facilities in each of the provider (6%) and control (7%) arm reported stock-outs of RDTs in the 4 weeks prior to the provider survey compared to 1 facility (2%) in the provider-school arm. All facilities procured ACT through the usual channels with a third of facilities in the provider (32%) and provider-school (33%) arms reporting stock-outs in the 4 weeks before the provider survey compared with 16% in control. Stock-outs of ACT mainly occurred in public facilities (86%) compared with pharmacies (5%) and drug stores (23%) due to an unexpected break in supply from the Central Medical Stores to public facilities.</p></sec><title>Characteristics of the study population</title><p>The stratification and restricted randomisation were shown to have provided study arms that were generally similar in their characteristics with a few exceptions (Table 1). Patients were more likely to attend pharmacies in the provider-school arm, and drug stores in the other arms. Those in the control arm appear to be of higher socio-economic status and of the highest (tertiary) education.</p>\n",

      "<abstract><p>This pilot study evaluates the degree of side effects during high-dose chemotherapy (HD-VIC) plus autologous bone marrow transplant (HDCT) and its possible prevention by the cytoprotective thiol-derivate amifostine. Additionally, the in-patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared. 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD-VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine (910 mg/m2 at day 1–3) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide. Patients were stratified according to pretreatment. HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin (500 mg/m2/d over 18 h), ifosfamide (4 g/m2/d over 4 h) and etoposide (500 mg/m2/d) all given for 3 consecutive days. All patients received prophylactic application of G-CSF (5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment. Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, haematopoietic recovery, as well as frequency of fever and infections. The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10% from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min−1) and 37% in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min−1) (P&lt; 0.01). Amifostine-treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion. Stomatitis grade III/IV occurred in 25% without versus 0% of patients with amifostine (P = 0.01). Acute nausea/vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists/dexamethasone/trifluorpromazine. However, delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients. Engraftment of neutrophil (&gt; 500 μl−1) and thrombocytes (&gt; 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12, respectively, both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm. In addition, a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm. The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30% savings in costs for supportive care (Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient). Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine, calculation of in-patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm. This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD-VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine. Additionally, a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine-treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned. Larger randomized trials evaluating amifostine cytoprotection during high-dose chemotherapy are warranted. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign <ext-link>http://www.bjcancer.com</ext-link></p></abstract>\n",

The baseline characteristics including age, sex, procedure type, body mass index, smoking and alcohol history, outpatient status, anticoagulant use, ASA score, modified Mallampati score, and underlying diseases were not significantly different in the 2 groups (Table 1). Additionally, there was no difference in interventional procedures such as polypectomy (P = .773), biopsy ( P = .930), and epinephrine injection ( P = .934). Sedation-related outcomes such as induction time ( P = .833), total procedure time ( P = .111) and awake time (P = .070) were not different (Table 2).</p><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Assembly of patients.

      "<abstract><p>We examined the effects of a 10–14-weeks inpatient lifestyle modification program, including minimum 90 min of physical activity (PA) five days/week, on body composition, CVD risk factors, and eating behavior in 139 obese subjects (BMI 42.6 ± 5.2 kg/m 2 ). Completion rate was 71% ( n = 71) in the intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group and 85% ( n = 33) among waiting list controls. Compared to controls body weight (−17.0 (95% CI: −18.7, −15.3) kg,  P &lt; 0.0001), fat mass (−15.2 (95% CI: −17.4, −13.1) kg,  P &lt; 0.0001), fat free mass (−1.2 (95% CI: −2.2, −0.2) kg,  P = 0.016) and visceral fat (−86.6(95% CI: −97.4, −75.7) cm 2 ,  P &lt; 0.0001) were reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks. Within the ILI-group weight loss was −23.8 (95% CI: −25.9, −21.7) kg,  P &lt; 0.0001 and -20.3 (95% CI: −23.3, −17.3) kg,  P &lt; 0.0001, after six and 12 months, respectively. Systolic BP, glucose, triglycerides, and LDL-C were reduced, and HDL-C was increased (all  P ≤ 0.006) after 10–14 weeks within the ILI group. The reduction in glucose and increase in HDL-C were sustained after 12 months (all  P &lt; 0.0001). After one year, weight loss was related to increased cognitive restraint and decreased uncontrolled eating (all  P &lt; 0.05). Thus, ILI including high volume of PA resulted in weight loss with almost maintenance of fat-free mass, favorable changes in CVD risk factors, and eating behavior in subjects with severe obesity.</p></abstract><sec><title>3.

Changes in Weight and Body Composition within the ILI-Group</title><p>Changes in BC within the ILI-group at weeks 10–14, six, and 12 months are shown in  Table 3 . After six- and 12-month followup BW reduction was −23.8 ((95% CI: −25.9, −21.7) kg,  P &lt; 0.0001) and −20.3 ((95% CI: −23.3, −17.3) kg,  P &lt; 0.0001), respectively, compared with baseline. Within the ILI-group, the mean (SD) percentage weight loss at 12 months was 15.6% (9.2%), and VFA and FM were reduced by 30.8% (21.1%) and 28.8% (17.4%) compared to baseline, respectively, ( Figure 3 ). </p><p>The proportions of subjects in the ILI-group achieving ≥5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% reduction of their initial weight, respectively, are shown in  Table 4 . </p><p>Figure 4shows the development in BMI of each subject in the ILI-group.

Changes in CVD risk factors and exercise capacity within the ILI-group are shown in Tables  5 and  6 . The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was reduced significantly ( P &lt; 0.0001) within the ILI-group across the four time points ( Figure 5 ).</p></sec><sec><title>3.5. Eating Behavior before and after Intervention</title><p>Group comparisons of scores on the TFEQ-R21 showed no differences in eating behavior at baseline ( Table 7 ). Eating behavior in the ILI-group and controls prior to and after treatment is shown in  Figure 6 . Together these changes resulted in a significant reduction in UE and EE ( P = 0.033 and  P &lt; 0.0001) and increase in CR ( P &lt; 0.0001) scores from week 0 to 12 months of followup within the ILI-group, where the main changes occurred during the intervention period and remained quite stable thereafter. </p><p>Table 8shows the univariate GLM analysis with respect to changes in weight and eating behaviour, respectively. </p></sec></sec>\n",

      "<abstract><sec><title>Objective</title><p> The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of an ultra-low-dose vaginal estriol 0.03 mg in combination with viable Lactobacillus acidophilus KS400 (Gynoflor® vaginal tablets) in the short-term therapy and to investigate the long-term maintenance dose in the treatment of vaginal atrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p> This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (Controlled phase – initial therapy) followed by an open-label follow-up (Open phase – test medication initial and maintenance therapy). Included were postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy symptoms and Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) of ≤ 40%. The method of treatment was initial therapy with test medication (or placebo in first phase), one vaginal tablet daily for 12 days, followed by maintenance therapy, one tablet on two consecutive days weekly for 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> A total of 87 women completed the study. The Controlled phase results for a change in VMI demonstrated superiority of the 0.03 mg estriol–lactobacilli combination to placebo (p &lt; 0.001). In the test group, the positive change in VMI was 35.2%, compared to 9.9% in the placebo group. In the Open phase after the initial therapy, the VMI was increased to 55.4% and, during maintenance therapy, it stayed at a comparable level (52.8–49.4%). The maturation of epithelium was followed by improvement of clinical symptoms and normalization of the vaginal ecosystem.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p> The ultra-low-dose, vaginal 0.03 mg estriol–lactobacilli combination (Gynoflor®) was superior to placebo with respect to changes in VMI after the 12-day initial therapy, and the maintenance therapy of two tablets weekly was sufficient to prevent the relapse of vaginal atrophy.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>Results</title><p>An overview of subject disposition is given in Figure 2. A total of 87 women completed both phases of the study as scheduled. Reasons for discontinuation were premature discontinuation at their own request or failure to show up at control visits. One woman in the placebo group withdrew her consent before visit C1 and was excluded from the ITT population due to no data. Another woman in the placebo group was excluded from the PPS population due to prior termination of the study after visit C1. During the Open phase, there was another major protocol violation as the woman did not comply with the treatment.

The percentage of women with moderate or severe dryness decreased more in the estriol–lactobacilli combination group, resulting in a significant difference between the groups, both at C1 (p = 0.023) and at C2 (p &lt; 0.001). The number of women who reported having intercourse was too low for a valid statistical analysis of dyspareunia (E: approximately 45%, C1 and C2: 11–21%). The percentage with moderate or severe dyspareunia at E was 84% in the estriol–lactobacilli combination group and 90% in the placebo group. The corresponding numbers at C1 were 40% for both groups, and at C2 -0% in the estriol–lactobacilli combination group and 22% in the placebo group. Individual results for dyspareunia, abnormal discharge, pruritus, and soreness therefore were not significantly different between the estriol–lactobacilli combination and placebo groups.</p><fig><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Dynamics of vaginal symptoms, Controlled phase.

The total symptom score improved during estriol–lactobacilli combination therapy compared to placebo: at C1 without significant difference, and at C2 with significant difference. The percentages of the increase of superficial cells and the decrease of parabasal cells showed a similar dynamic: at C1 there were no significant differences between the groups; however, at C2 significant improvements in favor of the estriol–lactobacilli combination were observed. The number of lactobacilli and LBG also improved in both groups at C1, with no significant difference between the groups. But again, the corresponding results at C2 were significantly better in the test medication group. The mean vaginal pH decreased significantly more in the estriol–lactobacilli combination group as compared to placebo both at C1 and at C2. The global efficacy of the estriol–lactobacilli combination by investigator was significantly better than that of placebo, both at C1 and at C2. The rating by the patient was not significantly different at C1, but at C2 was significantly better for the test group.</p>\n",

Our objective was to investigate the effect of HAI surveillance disruption on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A quasi-experimental study with an intervention group and a control group was conducted between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2010 in two intensive care units (ICUs) of a university hospital that participated in a national HAI surveillance network. Surveillance was interrupted during the year 2007 in unit A (intervention group) and was continuous in unit B (control group). Period 1 (pre-test period) comprised patients hospitalized during 2004 to 2006, and period 2 (post-test period) involved patients hospitalized during 2008 to 2010. Patients hospitalized ≥48 hours and intubated during their stay were included. Multivariate Poisson regression was fitted to ascertain the influence of surveillance disruption.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2,771 patients, accounting for 19,848 intubation-days at risk, were studied; 307 had VAP. The VAP attack rate increased in unit A from 7.8% during period 1 to 17.1% during period 2 (P &lt;0.001); in unit B, it was 7.2% and 11.2% for the two periods respectively (P = 0.17). Adjusted VAP incidence rose in unit A after surveillance disruption (incidence rate ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.47, P = 0.036), independently of VAP trend; no change was observed in unit B. All-cause mortality and length of stay increased (P = 0.028 and P = 0.038, respectively) in unit A between periods 1 and 2. In unit B, no change in mortality was observed (P = 0.22), while length of stay decreased between periods 1 and 2 (P = 0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>VAP incidence, length of stay and all-cause mortality rose after HAI surveillance disruption in ICU, which suggests a specific effect of HAI surveillance on VAP prevention and reinforces the role of data feedback and counselling as a mechanism to facilitate performance improvement.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Of the 4,411 patients included in the surveillance of both units during the study period, 2,915 (61.1%) were exposed to mechanical ventilation during their hospital stay.

Among them, 940 (34%) were hospitalised in unit A, and 1,831 (66%) in unit B. Overall, 62% (n = 1,724) were men, and mean ± SD age was 60 ± 16 years. Totally, 61% (n = 1,694) received antibiotics at admission, 41% (n = 1,142) came from home, and 26% (n = 721) were immunosuppressed. Mean ± SD SAPSII score was 53 ± 20. All-cause in-hospital mortality was 26% (n = 712).</p><p>Overall, 307 patients had VAP. The VAP attack rate was 11.1 per 100 intubated patients and the VAP incidence rate was 15.5 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 13.8 to 17.3) per 1,000 intubation-days at risk.</p></sec><title>Characteristics by group and period</title><p>Table 1 reports the characteristics of hospitalised patients by group and period.

      "<abstract><p>Most patients with fibromyalgia use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Properly designed controlled trials are necessary to assess the effectiveness of these practices. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, early phase trial. Fifty patients seen at a fibromyalgia outpatient treatment program were randomly assigned to a daily soy or placebo (casein) shake. Outcome measures were scores of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention. Analysis was with standard statistics based on the null hypothesis, and separation test for early phase CAM comparative trials. Twenty-eight patients completed the study. Use of standard statistics with intent-to-treat analysis showed that total FIQ scores decreased by 14% in the soy group (P = .02) and by 18% in the placebo group (P &lt; .001). The difference in change in scores between the groups was not significant (P = .16). With the same analysis, CES-D scores decreased in the soy group by 16% (P = .004) and in the placebo group by 15% (P = .05). The change in scores was similar in the groups (P = .83). Results of statistical analysis using the separation test and intent-to-treat analysis revealed no benefit of soy compared with placebo. Shakes that contain soy and shakes that contain casein, when combined with a multidisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program, provide a decrease in fibromyalgia symptoms. Separation between the effects of soy and casein (control) shakes did not favor the intervention. Therefore, large-sample studies using soy for patients with fibromyalgia are probably not indicated.</p></abstract><sec><title>3. Results</title><sec><title>3.1. Baseline Characteristics</title><p>A total of 50 patients (49 women) were recruited for this trial. Median age was 47.7 years (range, 18–76 years). There was no significant difference in age (P = .99), FIQ scores (P = .36) or CES-D scores (P = .48) between the two groups. Twenty-eight patients (56%)—12 in the soy group and 16 in the placebo group (P = .39)—completed the 6-week trial. Reasons for not completing it are depicted in Figure 1. Patients who did not finish the trial were significantly younger (median age, 39.8 years) than those who finished it (median age, 53.9 years) (P &lt; .001). The median FIQ score was higher for patients who did not complete the trial (59.5) than for those who completed the study (54.8), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .12). The median CES-D score also was higher for patients who did not complete the trial (26.5) than for patients who completed the trial (14.0), but this also was not a statistically significant difference (P = .14).</p></sec><sec><title>3.2. Between-Group Comparisons</title><p>With intent-to-treat analysis, the total FIQ scores determined at study entry and at study completion decreased 14% (±29) in the soy group and 18% (±25) in the placebo group (P = .16). With per-protocol analysis, the total FIQ scores decreased 29% (±36) in the soy group and 28% (±26) in the placebo group (P = .93) (Figure 2). No statistically significant decrease between the soy group and the placebo group was observed for any of the FIQ subclass scores. With intent-to-treat analysis, the CES-D scores improved 16% (±26) in the soy group and 15% (±41) in the placebo group (P = .83); with per-protocol analysis, the CES-D scores improved 33% (±30) in the soy group and 24% (±50) in the placebo group (Figure 3). However, the decrease between the groups was not statistically significant (P = .96). Using various cutoff points for depression (CES-D ≥ 16, CES-D ≥ 19 and CES-D ≥ 27) and intent-to-treat analysis, we found a depression rate of 52%, 48% and 28%, respectively, in the soy group and 52%, 48% and 32% in the control group at study entry. After 6 weeks, these percentages were 48%, 44% and 24% in the treatment group and 48%, 36% and 24% in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P = 1.00). Determined by using per-protocol analysis for these three different CES-D scores, the percentages of patients with depression at study entry in the treatment group were 42%, 33% and 8% and in the control group were 38%, 38% and 19%. After 6 weeks, 33% of the treatment group had CES-D scores of 16 or greater, 25% had scores of 19 or greater and 0% had scores of 27 or greater. The percentages for the control group were 31%, 19% and 6%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. </p><p>The separation test using the difference from baseline to 6 weeks showed no benefit for soy, as determined by FIQ scores and CES-D scores for both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.

      "<abstract><p>The aim of this study was to compare changes in young soccer player's fitness after traditional bilateral vs. unilateral combined plyometric and strength training. Male athletes were randomly divided in two groups; both received the same training, including strength training for knee extensors and flexors, in addition to horizontal plyometric training drills. The only difference between groups was the mode of drills technique: unilateral (UG; n = 9; age, 17.3 ± 1.1 years) vs. bilateral (TG; n = 9; age, 17.6 ± 0.5 years). One repetition maximum bilateral strength of knee muscle extensors (1RM_KE) and flexors (1RM_KF), change of direction ability (COD), horizontal and vertical jump ability with one (unilateral) and two (bilateral) legs, and limb symmetry index were measured before and after an 8-week in-season intervention period. Some regular soccer drills were replaced by combination of plyometric and strength training drills. Magnitude-based inference statistics were used for between-group and within-group comparisons. Beneficial effects ( p &lt; 0.05) in 1RM_KE, COD, and several test of jumping performance were found in both groups in comparison to pre-test values. The limb symmetry index was not affected in either group. The beneficial changes in 1RM_KE (8.1%; p = 0.074) and 1RM_KF (6.7%; p = 0.004), COD (3.1%; p = 0.149), and bilateral jump performance (from 2.7% [ p = 0.535] to 10.5% [ p = 0.002]) were possible to most likely beneficial in the TG than in the UG. However, unilateral jump performance measures achieved likely to most likely beneficial changes in the UG compared to the TG (from 4.5% [ p = 0.090] to 8.6% [ p = 0.018]).

The participants were divided into a group of 19 firefighters exposed to occupational noise and a control group of 10 adults who were not exposed to such noise. All subjects were assigned a sound localization task involving 117 stimuli from 13 sound sources that were spatially distributed in horizontal, vertical, midsagittal and transverse planes. The three stimuli, which were square waves with fundamental frequencies of 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz, were presented at a sound level of 70 dB and were randomly repeated three times from each sound source. The angle between the speaker's axis in the same plane was 45°, and the distance to the subject was 1 m.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULT:</title><p>The results demonstrate that the sound localization ability of the firefighters was significantly lower (p&lt;0.01) than that of the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p>Exposure to occupational noise, even when not resulting in hearing loss, may lead to a diminished ability to locate a sound source.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results were obtained from a cohort of fifteen men and four women (n = 19).

      "<abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Limited information has been published regarding how specific processes for event adjudication can affect event rates in trials. We reviewed nonfatal myocardial infarctions (MIs) reported by site investigators in the international Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin (Eptifibatide) Therapy (PURSUIT) trial and those adjudicated by a central clinical events committee (CEC) to determine the reasons for differences in event rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The PURSUIT trial randomised 10,948 patients with acute coronary syndromes to receive eptifibatide or placebo. The primary end-point was death or post-enrolment MI at 30 days as assessed by the CEC; this end-point was also constructed using site-reported events. The CEC identified suspected MIs by systematic review of clinical, cardiac enzyme, and electrocardiographic data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The CEC identified 5005 (46%) suspected events, of which 1415 (28%) were adjudicated as MI. The site investigator and CEC assessments of whether a MI had occurred disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients with suspected MI, mostly reflecting site misclassification of post-enrolment MIs (as enrolment MIs) or underreported periprocedural MIs. Patients for whom the CEC and site investigator agreed that no end-point MI had occurred had the lowest mortality at 30 days and between 30 days and 6 months, and those with agreement that a MI had occurred had the highest mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CEC adjudication provides a standard, systematic, independent, and unbiased assessment of end-points, particularly for trials that span geographic regions and clinical practice settings. Understanding the review process and reasons for disagreement between CEC and site investigator assessments of MI is important to design future trials and interpret event rates between trials.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Incidence of disagreement</title><p>Overall, 5005 (46%) patients with possible or suspected MI were identified and adjudicated by the CEC. The CEC identified more patients with end-point events than did the site investigators (13.6% versus 7.7% for placebo, 12.6% versus 6.2% for eptifibatide). The CEC and site investigator assessments of MI disagreed for 9% of all patients enrolled in the PURSUIT trial. The CEC identified MIs in 1415 of the 5005 patients with suspected MI. The site investigator and the CEC assessments disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients. Of these 983 patients with disagreements, 816 patients had a MI identified by the CEC but not the site investigator, and 167 patients had a MI identified by site investigator but not the CEC. The proportion of patients with disagreement was similar among regions.</p></sec><title>Reasons for disagreement</title><p>Most often, when the site investigator had identified a MI and the CEC had not, the investigator had misclassified a MI at enrolment as an end-point MI, although by protocol these were not end-point events (Table 1). Recurrent ischemic events without elevated cardiac enzymes or ECG evidence of MI were also incorrectly identified by site investigators as MIs (Table 1). In cases where the CEC had identified a MI and the site investigators had not, one-third of those identified were MIs defined by enzyme elevations without clinical or ECG evidence of ischemia or infarction (Table 2). Enzyme elevations after bypass surgery accounted for 25% of these cases. Patients with clinically evident ischemia reported by the site investigator and associated with cardiac enzyme elevations were not reported as MIs by investigators in 27% of the cases of disagreement (Table 2). Few infarctions based on new Q waves without clinical evidence of reinfarction were identified by the CEC and not by site investigators.</p><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Myocardial infarctions identified by site investigators but not confirmed by the clinical events committee</p></caption><table><thead><tr><td></td><td>Eastern Europe</td><td>Latin America</td><td>North America</td><td>Western Europe</td><td>Overall</td></tr><tr><td>Clinical scenario</td><td>(n = 24)</td><td>(n = 8)</td><td>(n = 57)</td><td>(n = 78)</td><td>(n = 167)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Enrolment myocardial infarction*</td><td>8 (33)</td><td>4 (50)</td><td>24 (42)</td><td>28 (36)</td><td>64 (38)</td></tr><tr><td>Ischemic event without infarction†</td><td>7 (29)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>8 (14)</td><td>19 (24)</td><td>34 (20)</td></tr><tr><td>Peri-death infarction‡</td><td>6 (25)</td><td>2 (25)</td><td>13 (23)</td><td>8 (10)</td><td>29 (17)</td></tr><tr><td>Percutaneous coronary intervention related</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (12.5)</td><td>6 (11)</td><td>10 (13)</td><td>17 (10)</td></tr><tr><td>Coronary artery bypass surgery related</td><td>2 (8)</td><td>1 (12.5)</td><td>5 (9)</td><td>7 (9)</td><td>15 (9)</td></tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous</td><td>1 (4)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>6 (8)</td><td>8 (5)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data presented as n (%). * Not an end-point event per protocol. † Clinical evidence of ischemia without electrocardiography (ECG) or cardiac enzyme evidence of infarction. ‡ Infarction suspected at the time of death without supporting clinical, ECG, or cardiac enzyme data.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>\n",

Of these 106 patients, 93 underwent MR imaging, and all were included in this analysis (Figure 1). Table 1 lists the baseline characteristics of the patients included. They were well matched between both groups. Eighty percent of the patients were women who have been shown to be more likely to suffer from claustrophobia [8]. The mean age was 53 (SD, 12; range, 27-88), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 29 (SD, 7.5; range, 17.5–52). All patients were at increased risk to suffer from claustrophobia. The mean CLQ score was 2,35 (SD, 0.69) which is in accordance with other high-risk groups [16]. Moreover, 50.5% of the 93 patients had prior MR imaging which was prevented, aborted or performed with sedation due to claustrophobia.

      "<p>In the 93 patients who underwent spinal MR imaging there were 48 examinations on the short-bore MR scanner and 55 examinations on the open MR scanner. 25 examinations were performed after cross-referral, 16 of them with conscious sedation (Figure 1, Table 2). Only one patient aborted MR imaging on the first scanner due to claustrophobia after one sequence, which was thus not included in the primary analysis. The other patients who were imaged after cross-referral rejected MR imaging on the first scanner before the examination had started (Figure 1). Thus, none of the patients was scanned on both scanners. Details of the MR imaging characteristics are listed in Table 2. Scanning times were significantly longer for open MR imaging and the perceived noise and pain levels were also higher, although statistically not significant, in patients who were examined with the open MR scanner [8].</p><table-wrap><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0083427.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the MR Examinations.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic></graphic><table><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><td></td><td>Short-Bore MR Group</td><td>Open MR</td><td>P Value </td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of MR examinationsa</td><td>48</td><td>55</td><td>.9</td></tr><tr><td>Cervicothoracic spine</td><td>18 (37.5)</td><td>21 (38.2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Thoracolumbar spine</td><td>30 (62.5)</td><td>34 (61.8)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of MR sequences</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>T1w/T2w sagittal</td><td>48</td><td>55</td><td>.9</td></tr><tr><td>Cervicothoracic spine</td><td>18 (37.5)</td><td>21 (38.2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Thoracolumbar spine</td><td>30 (62.5)</td><td>34 (61.8)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>T2w axialb</td><td>68</td><td>76</td><td>.9</td></tr><tr><td>Cervicothoracic spine</td><td>19 (28)</td><td>22 (28.9)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Thoracolumbar spine</td><td>49 (72)</td><td>54 (71.1)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Scan duration (min)</td><td>19.8 (SD, 8.5)</td><td>31.7 (SD, 21.6)</td><td>.001</td></tr><tr><td>Cervicothoracic spine</td><td>19 (SD, 5.3)</td><td>30.1 (SD, 7.8)</td><td>.001</td></tr><tr><td>Thoracolumbar spine</td><td>17.5 (SD, 7.1)</td><td>25.8 (SD, 10.2)</td><td>.001</td></tr><tr><td>Whole spine</td><td>37 (SD, 6.8)</td><td>70 (SD, 42)</td><td>.2</td></tr><tr><td>Anxietyc</td><td>58.1 (SD, 33.9)</td><td>50.3 (SD, 30.6)</td><td>.3</td></tr><tr><td>Cervicothoracic spine</td><td>58.6 (SD, 34.9)</td><td>48.1 (SD, 30.1)</td><td>.4</td></tr><tr><td>Thoracolumbar spine</td><td>55.8 (SD, 32.8)</td><td>51.8 (SD, 31.9)</td><td>.7</td></tr><tr><td>Whole spine</td><td>71 (SD, 44.8)</td><td>49 (SD, 30.5)</td><td>.4</td></tr><tr><td>Noisec</td><td>57.5 (SD, 21.3)</td><td>65.9 (SD, 23.1)</td><td>.08</td></tr><tr><td>Cervicothoracic spine</td><td>52.2 (SD, 24)</td><td>62.5 (SD, 25)</td><td>.3</td></tr><tr><td>Thoracolumbar spine</td><td>58.5 (SD, 18.3)</td><td>71.6 (SD, 21.1)</td><td>.02</td></tr><tr><td>Whole spine</td><td>69.8 (SD, 29.2)</td><td>47.7 (SD, 18.6)</td><td>.2</td></tr><tr><td>Painc</td><td>19.8 (SD, 27.5)</td><td>31 (SD, 32.5)</td><td>.08</td></tr><tr><td>Cervicothoracic spine</td><td>20 (SD, 29.7)</td><td>27.6 (SD, 28.7)</td><td>.5</td></tr><tr><td>Thoracolumbar spine</td><td>21.2 (SD, 28.3)</td><td>28.6 (SD, 33.8)</td><td>.4</td></tr><tr><td>Whole spine</td><td>10.5 (SD, 15.8)</td><td>51.2 (SD, 33.7)</td><td>.06</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn><label></label><p>Data are number (%) or arithmetic mean (SD).

There were significantly more artifacts in sagittal T1-weighted sequences of the cervicothoracic and the thoracolumbar spine and in axial T2-weighted sequences of the thoracolumbar spine when obtained with the open MR scanner. Relevant artifacts were mainly due to motion for both, short-bore and open MR imaging. However, none of the examinations showed severe artifacts limiting their diagnostic value.

      "<abstract><sec><title>OBJECTIVE</title><p>Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes but less so in children. We designed a study to assess CGM benefit in young children aged 4 to 9 years with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>After a run-in phase, 146 children with type 1 diabetes (mean age 7.5 ± 1.7 years, 64% on pumps, median diabetes duration 3.5 years) were randomly assigned to CGM or to usual care. The primary outcome was reduction in HbA1c at 26 weeks by ≥0.5% without the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The primary outcome was achieved by 19% in the CGM group and 28% in the control group (P = 0.17). Mean change in HbA1c was −0.1% in each group (P = 0.79). Severe hypoglycemia rates were similarly low in both groups. CGM wear decreased over time, with only 41% averaging at least 6 days/week at 26 weeks. There was no correlation between CGM use and change in HbA1c (rs = −0.09, P = 0.44). CGM wear was well tolerated, and parental satisfaction with CGM was high. However, parental fear of hypoglycemia was not reduced.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>CGM in 4- to 9-year-olds did not improve glycemic control despite a high degree of parental satisfaction with CGM. We postulate that this finding may be related in part to limited use of the CGM glucose data in day-to-day management and to an unremitting fear of hypoglycemia. Overcoming the barriers that prevent integration of these critical glucose data into day-to-day management remains a challenge.</p></sec></abstract><title>RESULTS</title><p>Between January 2009 and December 2010, the trial randomized 146 children aged 4.0–9.9 years (7.5 ± 1.7 years [mean ± SD]) who had a median duration of type 1 diabetes of 3.5 years (interquartile range 2.2–5.2).

      "<abstract><sec><title>BACKGROUND:</title><p>Induction of anesthesia is the most crucial period of general anesthesia. Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia. Tracheal intubation can be done after reaching the deep levels of anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (BIS) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>In a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I &amp; II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O 2 ) and N 2 O and continued until target BIS (60 ± 2, 50 ± 2 and 40 ± 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>BIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting.

This is a secondary analysis of previously published data to investigate the effects of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) on strength of various muscle groups in critically ill patients. Methods. One hundred forty-two consecutive patients, with APACHE II score ≥ 13, were randomly assigned to the EMS or the control group. EMS sessions were applied daily on vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and peroneus longus of both lower extremities. Various muscle groups were evaluated with the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength. Handgrip strength assessment was also employed. Results. Twenty four patients in the EMS group and 28 patients in the control group were finally evaluated. EMS patients achieved higher MRC scores than controls (P ≤ 0.05) in wrist flexion, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion. Collectively, the EMS group performed higher (P &lt; 0.01) in the legs and overall. Handgrip strength correlated (P ≤ 0.01) with the upper and lower extremities' muscle strength and the overall MRC scores. Conclusions. EMS has beneficial effects on the strength of critically ill patients mainly affecting muscle groups stimulated, while it may also affect muscle groups not involved presenting itself as a potential effective means of muscle strength preservation and early mobilization in this patient population. </p></abstract><sec><title>3.

Baseline characteristics of patients finally evaluated in both groups are presented in Table 1.</p><p> The MRC scores of all the movements of the upper and lower extremities assessed are presented in Table 2. Patients of the EMS group performed statistically higher MRC scores than controls in wrist flexion, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion of both sides. No statistical differences were found between the two groups in all other movements. No significant between-group differences were observed for the MRC score of the left and the right arm either, while the MRC scores of the left and right legs were significantly higher in the EMS group. Similar between-group results were found for the total MRC score of the arms (EMS: 28 (26–30); control: 26 (22–30), P = 0.16) and the legs (EMS: 29 (26–30); control: 25 (20–28), P = 0.01). The overall MRC score was significantly higher in patients assigned to the EMS group in comparison to the control group (58 (51–60) versus 52 (40–58), P = 0.04) (Figure 2).</p><p>In concern to the baseline characteristics of the subgroup in which handgrip dynamometry was applied (n = 21), no difference was found between the control (n = 9) and the EMS group (n = 12) in gender (males/females, 6/3 versus 10/2, P = 0.61), age (65 ± 22 versus 61 ± 14 years, P = 0.25), or APACHE II score (19 ± 4 versus 17 ± 4, P = 0.46).</p><p>No difference was observed between the EMS and the control group in handgrip strength either in absolute (21.4 ± 10.8 versus 14.8 ± 10.7 kg, resp., P = 0.18) or relative (60.2 ± 27.3% predicted versus 49.1 ± 28.5% predicted, resp., P = 0.38) values. A significant difference was found in handgrip strength between patients diagnosed with ICU-AW in comparison to those without an ICU-AW diagnosis (6.6 ± 4.4 versus 23.4 ± 8.9 kg, P &lt; 0.01), even when the comparison was adjusted for gender and age (P &lt; 0.01). This was also the case when handgrip performance was expressed in relative values (29.0 ± 22.4% predicted versus 66.0 ± 22.2% predicted, P &lt; 0.01).</p><p>In concern to between-sides comparison, patients tended to perform better with the dominant rather than the non-dominant hand (16.2 ± 11.1 versus 14.2 ± 9.9 kg, resp., P = 0.09). All patients assessed were right handed, therefore the results were similar for comparison between right and left sides. Three patients performed better with the left hand, and in another 3 patients, there was no difference between hands. The 95% limits of agreement were also calculated and found to range from −7.1 to 10.3 kg.</p><p>In relation to between-trial comparisons, no difference was observed over the 5 trials performed (1st: 16.1 ± 10.5 kg, 2nd: 16.8 ± 10.8 kg, 3rd: 16.9 ± 11.5 kg, 4th: 16.6 ± 11.0, and 5th: 17.1 ± 11.5 kg, P = 0.44).</p><p>Finally, handgrip strength in absolute values correlated (P &lt; 0.01) with the MRC score of upper extremities (r = 0.78), lower extremities (r = 0.73), and the overall (r = 0.79) MRC scores (Figure 3). The respective correlation coefficients (P ≤ 0.01) for handgrip strength in relative values (% predicted) were 0.58, 0.53, and 0.55.</p></sec><fig><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart diagram of the patients admitted to the ICU during the 30-month study period.

      "<abstract><p>Recent research on whole-body cryotherapy has hypothesized a major responsibility of head cooling in the physiological changes classically reported after a cryostimulation session. The aim of this experiment was to verify this hypothesis by studying the influence of exposing the head to cold during whole-body cryostimulation sessions, on the thermal response and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Over five consecutive days, two groups of 10 participants performed one whole-body cryostimulation session daily, in one of two different systems; one exposing the whole-body to cold (whole-body cryostimulation, WBC), and the other exposing the whole-body except the head (partial-body cryostimulation, PBC).10 participants constituted a control group (CON) not receiving any cryostimulation. In order to isolate the head-cooling effect on recorded variables, it was ensured that the WBC and PBC systems induced the same decrease in skin temperature for all body regions (mean decrease over the 5 exposures: -8.6°C±1.3°C and -8.3±0.7°C for WBC and PBC, respectively), which persisted up to 20-min after the sessions (P20). The WBC sessions caused an almost certain decrease in tympanic temperature from Pre to P20 (-0.28 ±0.11°C), while it only decreased at P20 (-0.14±0.05°C) after PBC sessions. Heart rate almost certainly decreased after PBC (-8.6%) and WBC (-12.3%) sessions. Resting vagal-related heart rate variability indices (the root-mean square difference of successive normal R-R intervals, RMSSD, and high frequency band, HF) were very likely to almost certainly increased after PBC (RMSSD:+49.1%, HF: +123.3%) and WBC (RMSSD: +38.8%, HF:+70.3%). Plasma norepinephrine concentration was likely increased in similar proportions after PBC and WBC, but only after the first session. Both cryostimulation techniques stimulated the ANS with a predominance of parasympathetic tone activation from the first to the fifth session and in slightly greater proportion with WBC than PBC. The main result of this study indicates that the head exposure to cold during whole-body cryostimulation may not be the main factor responsible for the effects of cryostimulation on the ANS.</p></abstract><title>Results</title><p>All data of all subjects were taken into account in the presentation of the results.</p><sec><title>Skin and tympanic temperatures</title><p>Baseline skin temperature (Tskin) for all body regions was similar between groups before the cryostimulation, without difference between the first and fifth cryostimulation session (Fig 2). Each day, an almost certain very large reduction in mean skin temperature of the whole body was recorded within the 20-min after the PBC and WBC exposures (Fig 2). However, no difference was recorded between cryotherapy modalities from Post to P20. In both modalities, the mean Tskin almost certainly remained lower than baseline values up to P20 (Fig 2). In both modalities, a very likely large reduction in Tskin of the head was recorded in Post and persisted up to P5, in larger proportion for WBC than PBC (Fig 2). In both cryotherapy modalities, the mean decrease in Tskin for the whole body recorded immediately after (Post) the first cryostimulation session (-8.3±0.7°C and -8.6°C±1.3°C for PBC and WBC, respectively) was very likely larger than that recorded after the fifth cryostimulation session (-7.6±0.8°C and -7.7±0.9°C for PBC and WBC, respectively).</p><fig><object-id>10.1371/journal.pone.0124776.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Changes in the mean skin temperature of the whole body (except the head) and the head alone.</title><p>Values were recorded before (Pre), immediately after (Post) and for 20-min (P1 to P20) after the first and the fifth whole-body cryostimulation (WBC), and partial-body cryostimulation (PBC) sessions, and in the control (CON) condition.
