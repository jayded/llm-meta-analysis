# Abstract ## Background No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. ## Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2--10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir--ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with [ClinicalTrials.gov](#), [NCT04257656](#). ## Findings Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87--1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95--2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. ## Interpretation In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies. ## Funding Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Emergency Project of COVID-19, National Key Research and Development Program of China, the Beijing Science and Technology Project. # Results Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 255 patients were screened, of whom 237 were eligible ([figure 1](#) ). 158 patients were assigned to receive remdesivir and 79 to receive placebo; one patient in the placebo group withdrew their previously written informed consent after randomisation, so 158 and 78 patients were included in the ITT population. No patients were enrolled after March 12, because of the control of the outbreak in Wuhan and on the basis of the termination criteria specified in the protocol, the data safety and monitoring board recommended that the study be terminated and data analysed on March 29. At this stage, the interim analysis was abandoned. When all the other assumptions stayed the same, with the actual enrolment of 236 participants, the statistical power was reduced from 80% to 58%. <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Trial profile</figcaption> </figure> Three patients in the remdesivir group did not start their assigned treatment so were not included in safety analyses ([figure 1](#)). The median age of study patients was 65 years (IQR 56--71); sex distribution was 89 (56%) men versus 69 (44%) women in the remdesivir group and 51 (65%) versus 27 (35%) in the placebo group ([table 1](#) ). The most common comorbidity was hypertension, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease. Lopinavir--ritonavir was co-administered in 42 (18%) patients at baseline. Most patients were in category 3 of the six-point ordinal scale of clinical status at baseline. Some imbalances existed at enrolment between the groups, including more patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease in the remdesivir group than the placebo group. More patients in the control group than in the remdesivir group had been symptomatic for 10 days or less at the time of starting remdesivir or placebo treatment, and a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients had a respiratory rate of more than 24 breaths per min. No other major differences in symptoms, signs, laboratory results, disease severity, or treatments were observed between groups at baseline. ::::table-wrap

Data are median (IQR), n (%), or n/N (%). Clinical improvement (the
event) was defined as a decline of two categories on the modified
six-category ordinal scale of clinical status, or hospital discharge.
OR=odds ratio.

Differences are expressed as rate differences or Hodges-Lehmann
estimator and 95% CI.

Hazard ratio and 95% CI estimated by Cox proportional risk model.

Three patients in each group were survivors and ten patients in the
remdesivir group and seven patients in the placebo group were
non-survivors.

Calculated by ordinal logistic regression model.:::: <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Time to clinical improvement in the intention-to-treat population<br /> Adjusted hazard ratio for randomisation stratification was 1·25 (95% CI 0·88–1·78). *Including deaths before day 28 as right censored at day 28, the number of patients without clinical improvement was still included in the number at risk.</figcaption> </figure> Results for time to clinical improvement were similar in the per-protocol population (median 21·0 days [IQR 13·0--28·0] in the remdesivir group *vs* 23·0 days [15·0--28·0] in the placebo group HR 1·27 [95% CI 0·89--1·80]; [appendix pp 2--3, 5](#)). Although not statistically significant, in patients receiving remdesivir or placebo within 10 days of symptom onset in the ITT population, those receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo (median 18·0 days [IQR 12·0--28·0] *vs* 23·0 days [15·0--28·0]; HR 1·52 [0·95--2·43]; [appendix p 6](#)). If clinical improvement was defined as a one, instead of two, category decline, the HR was 1·34 with a 95% CI of 0·96--1·86 ([appendix p 7](#)). For time to clinical deterioration, defined as a one-category increase or death, the HR was 0·95 with a 95% CI of 0·55--1·64 ([appendix p 8](#)). 28-day mortality was similar between the two groups (22 [14%] died in the remdesivir group *vs* 10 (13%) in the placebo group; difference 1·1% [95% CI −8·1 to 10·3]). In patients with use of remdesivir within 10 days after symptom onset, 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the groups, although numerically higher in the placebo group; by contrast, in the group of patients with late use, remdesivir patients had numerically higher 28-day mortality, although there was no significant difference. Clinical improvement rates at days 14 and day 28 were also not significantly different between the groups, but numerically higher in the remdesivir group than the placebo group. For patients assigned to the remdesivir group, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was not significantly different, but numerically shorter than in those assigned to the control group; however, the number of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation was small. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in length of oxygen support, hospital length of stay, days from randomisation to discharge, days from randomisation to death and distribution of six-category scale at day 7, day 14, and day 28 ([table 3](#); [appendix p 9](#)). Of 236 patients (158 in the remdesivir group and 78 in the placebo group) who were RT-PCR positive at enrolment, 37 (19%) of the 196 with data available had undetectable viral RNA on the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab taken at baseline. The mean baseline viral load of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs was 4·7 log~10~ copies per mL (SE 0·3) in the remdesivir group and 4·7 log~10~ copies per mL (0·4) in the control group ([table 1](#)). Viral load decreased over time similarly in both groups ([figure 3A](#) ). No differences in viral load were observed when stratified by interval from symptom onset to start of study treatment ([appendix p 10](#)). In the subset of patients from whom expectorated sputa could be obtained (103 patients), the mean viral RNA load at enrolment was nearly 1-log higher in the remdesivir group than the placebo group at enrolment ([figure 3B](#)). When adjusted for baseline sputum viral load at enrolment, the remdesivir group showed no significant difference at day 5 from placebo, but a slightly more rapid decline in load (p=0·0672). <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Viral load by quantitative PCR on the upper respiratory tract specimens (A) and lower respiratory tract specimens (B)<br /> Data are mean (SE). Results less than the lower limit of quantification of the PCR assay and greater than the limit of qualitative detection are imputed with half of actual value; results of patients with viral-negative RNA are imputed with 0 log<sub>10</sub> copies per mL.</figcaption> </figure> The cumulative rate of undetectable viral RNA of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs by day 28 was 153 (78%) of 196 patients, and the negative proportion was similar among patients receiving remdesivir and those receiving placebo ([appendix p 4](#)). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 patients in the remdesivir group and 50 (64%) of 78 in the control group ([table 4](#) ). The most common adverse events in the remdesivir group were constipation, hypoalbuminaemia, hypokalaemia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased total bilirubin; and in the placebo group, the most common were hypoalbuminaemia, constipation, anaemia, hypokalaemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased blood lipids, and increased total bilirubin. 28 (18%) serious adverse events were reported in the remdesivir group and 20 (26%) were reported in the control group. More patients in the remdesivir group than the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events or serious adverse events (18 [12%] in the remdesivir group *vs* four [5%] in the placebo group), among whom seven (5%) were due to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome in the remdesivir group. All deaths during the observation period were judged by the site investigators to be unrelated to the intervention). ::::table-wrap
