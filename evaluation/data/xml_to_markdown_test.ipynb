      "# Abstract ## Background: Minor oral surgical procedures are the most commonly performed procedures by oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Performance of painless surgical procedure is highly appreciated by the patients and is possible through the use of local anesthesia, conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Postoperative pain can also be controlled by the use of opioids, as opioid receptors exist in the peripheral nervous system and offers the possibility of providing postoperative analgesia in the surgical patient. The present study compares the efficacy of 0.5% bupivacaine versus 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.3 mg buprenorphine in minor oral surgical procedures. ## Patients and Methods: The present study was conducted in 50 patients who required minor oral surgical procedures under local anesthesia. Two types of local anesthetic solutions were used- 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200000 epinephrine in group I and a mixture of 39 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200000 and 1 ml of 300 μg buprenorphine (3 μg/kg)in group II. Intraoperative and postoperative evaluation was carried out for both the anesthetic solutions. ## Results: The mean duration of postoperative analgesia in bupivacaine group (508.92 ± 63.30 minutes) was quite less than the buprenorphine combination group (1840.84 ± 819.51 minutes). The mean dose of postoperative analgesic medication in bupivacaine group (1.64 ± 0.99 tablets) was higher than buprenorphine combination group (0.80 ± 1.08 tablets). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the onset of action of the anesthetic effect and duration of anesthesia. ## Conclusion: Buprenorphine can be used in combination with bupivacaine for patients undergoing minor oral surgical procedures to provide postoperative analgesia for a longer duration. # RESULTS Out of total 50 patients selected for the study, there were 29 (58%) male and 21 (42%) female [ [Figure 1](#)]. The mean age of patients was 27.60 years in bupivacaine group and 27.50 years in buprenorphine combination with bupivacaine group. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Demographic data</figcaption> </figure> Patients were divided into two groups and the surgical procedures included surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars, incision and drainage of space infections, enucleation of cysts, dentoalveolar fractures, isolated mandibular fractures, maxillary fractures, elective implant removal, and excision of tumors [ [Figure 2](#)]. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Various minor oral surgical procedures done</figcaption> </figure> In both groups, the minimum volume of anesthetic solution used was 4 ml. However, the mean volume of bupivacaine solution including the amount needed for infiltration/reanesthesia was slightly higher (4.15 ± 0.52 ml) than the mean volume of buprenorphine combination with bupivacaine solution (4.12 ± 0.60 ml). The difference in the mean volume of both the solutions used was found to be statistically nonsignificant ( *P* = 0.84). The mean subjective onset of action in bupivacaine group (3.00 ± 1.08 min) was slightly longer than buprenorphine combination group (2.92 ± 1.03 min) whereas, on pinprick test, reverse was the case with the mean of 7.40 ± 1.93 min in buprenorphine combination group and 7.28 ± 1.59 min in bupivacaine group [ [Table 1](#)]. Statistically, no significant difference was observed between both groups regarding subjective ( *P* = 0.79) and objective onset of action ( *P* = 0.81). ::::table-wrap\n",

However, the mean duration of postoperative analgesia in bupivacaine group (508.92 ± 63.30 min) was observed to be quite less than buprenorphine combination group (1840.84 ± 819.51 min), and value was found to be highly significant statistically ( *P* < 0.001) [ [Table 2](#)]. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Internet research may raise older ethical issues in new forms or pose new issues. It has been recommended that debriefing information online be kept very short, with further information including study results made available if requested by participants. There are no empirical studies that compare possible alternative methods of debriefing in online studies. ## Objective To undertake a randomized controlled trial evaluating how to implement the recommended approach by assessing the effects of two different approaches on accessing of additional information. ## Methods All 11,943 participants in the Effects of Study Design and Allocation (ESDA) study, which employed deception, were randomly assigned to one of two methods of debriefing: Group A received the debriefing information in the body of an email with links to protocol and results pages; Group B was presented with these links after clicking on an initial link in the body of the email to view the debriefing information on a website. Outcomes assessed were the proportions clicking on the links to the protocol and results summary and the time spent on these pages by those accessing them. ## Results The group who were presented with no debriefing information in the body of the email and went to a website for this information (Group B) were approximately twice as likely to subsequently access the protocol and the results summary. These differences between the two groups were highly statistically significant. Although these differences are clear, the overall proportions accessing such information were low, and there were no differences in mean time spent reading these pages. Only one quarter of Group B actually accessed debriefing information. ## Conclusions In circumstances where the uptake of fuller information on study design, methods, and findings is deemed important, debriefing information may be better provided via a link and not included in the body of an email. Doing so may, however, reduce the extent of receiving any debriefing information at all. There is a wider need for high quality empirical studies to inform ethical evaluations. ## Trial Registration Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12610000846022 (http://www.anzctr.org.au/) # Results The CONSORT flowchart summarizing the study design and numbers included in the analyses is presented in [Figure 1](#). Group B was approximately twice as likely to have clicked on the protocol and results links, although the proportion doing so was less than 10% in each case (see [Table 1](#)). Group B was not likely to spend any more time reading this material. Approximately one quarter of this group visited the debrief page (see [Table 1](#)) and thus accessed any debriefing information at all, however, and we had no capacity to measure the extent of any reading of the debriefing information provided in the body of the email to Group A. Approximately one third of those who visited the debriefing page in Group B subsequently clicked on the link for results, and approximately one quarter did so for the protocol (see [Table 1](#) ). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Exhaustive exercise causes muscle damage accompanied by oxidative stress and inflammation leading to muscle fatigue and muscle soreness. Lemon verbena leaves, commonly used as tea and refreshing beverage, demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a proprietary lemon verbena extract (Recoverben®) on muscle strength and recovery after exhaustive exercise in comparison to a placebo product. ## Methods The study was performed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with parallel design. Forty-four healthy males and females, which were 22--50 years old and active in sports, were randomized to 400 mg lemon verbena extract once daily or placebo. The 15 days intervention was divided into 10 days supplementation prior to the exhaustive exercise day (intensive jump-protocol), one day during the test and four days after. Muscle strength (MVC), muscle damage (CK), oxidative stress (GPx), inflammation (IL6) and volunteer-reported muscle soreness intensity were assessed pre and post exercise. ## Results Participants in the lemon verbena group benefited from less muscle damage as well as faster and full recovery. Compared to placebo, lemon verbena extract receiving participants had significantly less exercise-related loss of muscle strength (*p* = 0.0311) over all timepoints, improved glutathione peroxidase activity by trend (*p* = 0.0681) and less movement induced pain (*p* = 0.0788) by trend. Creatine kinase and IL-6 didn't show significant discrimmination between groups. ## Conclusion Lemon verbena extract (Recoverben®) has been shown to be a safe and well-tolerated natural sports ingredient, by reducing muscle damage after exhaustive exercise. ## Trial registration The trial was registered in the clinical trials registry (clinical trial.gov [NCT02923102](#)). Registered 28 September 2016 # Results ## Group characteristics Out of 44 subjects allocated to intervention, 40 subjects (19 men and 21 women) completed the study according to the protocol (full analysis set; FAS). Four subjects dropped out after start of supplementation and before efficacy testing. Three of these suffered from a common cold, which did not allow them to perform the exhaustive exercise test, and one dropped out due to personal decision. Thirty-seven subjects were analyzed for valid case analysis set (VCAS). One subject had a strong common cold during the exhaustive exercise test, which may have influenced biomarker results. Another subject did not meet compliance criteria for study product intake and the third subject had major deviation of the exhaustive exercise protocol. As these three subjects did meet exclusion criteria for VCAS analysis, they were not considered in final analysis (VCAS). Gender, age, BMI, blood routine markers, and blood pressure did not differ significantly between the groups prior to the study. Subject characteristics are summarized in Table [2](#). The nutrition frequency questionnaire scores were 45.35 ± 10.51 points in the lemon verbena group and 42.65 ± 11.33 points in the placebo group (*p* = 0.4597). Most subjects consumed between two and four portions fruits plus vegetables per day (lemon verbena: 82%, placebo: 70%). Intake of fruit and vegetables, as supplier for polyphenols, were comparable between groups. The protocol compliance of study product intake was very good. For VCAS, all subjects met the compliance criterion ≥85% and ≤115% of study preparation consumed (lemon verbena group: 102 ± 5%, placebo: 101 ± 2%). For FAS, one subject had a compliance >115% since much less products remained, bringing up uncertainty about correct intake, which was the reason for exclusion from VCAS. Borg scale data after exhaustive exercise and jump repetitions were not significantly different between groups (*p* = 0.8997, *p* = 0.1561). Therefore, burden of subjects by the exhaustive exercise and jump protocol was comparable between groups, so a comparable stress could be expected. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Web-based, computer-tailored nutrition education interventions can be effective in modifying self-reported dietary behaviors. Traditional computer-tailored programs primarily targeted individual cognitions (knowledge, awareness, attitude, self-efficacy). Tailoring on additional variables such as self-regulation processes and environmental-level factors (the home food environment arrangement and perception of availability and prices of healthy food products in supermarkets) may improve efficacy and effect sizes (ES) of Web-based computer-tailored nutrition education interventions. ## Objective This study evaluated the short- and medium-term efficacy and educational differences in efficacy of a cognitive and environmental feedback version of a Web-based computer-tailored nutrition education intervention on self-reported fruit, vegetable, high-energy snack, and saturated fat intake compared to generic nutrition information in the total sample and among participants who did not comply with dietary guidelines (the risk groups). ## Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with a basic (tailored intervention targeting individual cognition and self-regulation processes; n=456), plus (basic intervention additionally targeting environmental-level factors; n=459), and control (generic nutrition information; n=434) group. Participants were recruited from the general population and randomly assigned to a study group. Self-reported fruit, vegetable, high-energy snack, and saturated fat intake were assessed at baseline and at 1- (T1) and 4-months (T2) postintervention using online questionnaires. Linear mixed model analyses examined group differences in change over time. Educational differences were examined with group×time×education interaction terms. ## Results In the total sample, the basic (T1: ES=--0.30; T2: ES=--0.18) and plus intervention groups (T1: ES=--0.29; T2: ES=--0.27) had larger decreases in high-energy snack intake than the control group. The basic version resulted in a larger decrease in saturated fat intake than the control intervention (T1: ES=--0.19; T2: ES=--0.17). In the risk groups, the basic version caused larger decreases in fat (T1: ES=--0.28; T2: ES=--0.28) and high-energy snack intake (T1: ES=--0.34; T2: ES=--0.20) than the control intervention. The plus version resulted in a larger increase in fruit (T1: ES=0.25; T2: ES=0.37) and a larger decrease in high-energy snack intake (T1: ES=--0.38; T2: ES=--0.32) than the control intervention. For high-energy snack intake, educational differences were found. Stratified analyses showed that the plus version was most effective for high-educated participants. ## Conclusions Both intervention versions were more effective in improving some of the self-reported dietary behaviors than generic nutrition information, especially in the risk groups, among both higher- and lower-educated participants. For fruit intake, only the plus version was more effective than providing generic nutrition information. Although feasible, incorporating environmental-level information is time-consuming. Therefore, the basic version may be more feasible for further implementation, although inclusion of feedback on the arrangement of the home food environment and on availability and prices may be considered for fruit and, for high-educated people, for high-energy snack intake. ## Trial Registration Netherlands Trial Registry NTR3396; http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3396 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6VNZbdL6w). # Results ## Participant Characteristics at Baseline A total of 1349 participants were included in the analyses. The mean age of the participants was 49.05 years (SD 10.62), 35.43% (478/1349) were male, 1.34% (18/1348) had a non-Western ethnic background, and 45.66% (616/1349) were in the high-educated group ([Table 1](#)). The mean daily vegetable intake was 159.12 grams (SD 69.24), daily fruit intake was 1.85 pieces (SD 1.29), daily high-energy snack intake was 3.34 pieces (SD 2.98), and mean saturated fat intake was 17.91 fat points (SD 6.07). The sizes of the risk groups were as follows: 1014 participants (75.17%) did not comply with the recommendation of 200 grams of vegetables a day, 803 participants (59.53%) did not comply with the guideline of 2 pieces of fruit per day, 808 participants (59.90%) consumed more than 2 high-energy snacks per day, and 627 participants (46.48%) did not comply with the age- and gender-specific guidelines for maximum fat intake. The plus group was significantly younger than the control group (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, *P*=.04) and the plus group consisted of more lower-educated people than the basic group (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.74, *P*=.04). Hence, age and education were included in the repeated measures analyses as covariates in addition to place of residence. ::::table-wrap\n",

Younger participants were more likely to drop out between baseline and T1 (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, *P*=.002) and T2 (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04, *P*<.001) compared to older participants. Dropout between baseline and T1 was higher in the basic (34.6%, 158/456; OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07-1.90, *P*=.02) and the plus group (37.3%, 171/459; OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.17-2.07, *P*=.003) than in the control group (27.2%, 118/434). Dropout between baseline and T2 was also higher in the basic (44.3%, 202/456; OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.04-1.80, *P*=.03) and plus group (48.4%, 222/459; OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20-2.07, *P=*.001) than in the control group (36.6%, 159/434). ## Assessment of Moderation by Educational Level No significant interaction effects with educational level were found in the total sample and risk groups for fruit, vegetable, and saturated fat intake. Therefore, stratified analyses by educational level were not indicated for these behaviors. For high-energy snack intake, the interaction with education was borderline significant in both the total sample (*F*~4,932.32~=2.34, *P*=.053) and risk group (*F*~4,533.59~=2.37, *P*=.051). Therefore, stratified analyses by educational level were performed as additional analyses for high-energy snack intake. ## Intervention Effects ### Fruit Intake Even though fruit intake increased over time (*F*~2,953.39~=38.44, *P*<.001), there was no difference in change over time between the 3 groups (*F*~4,1151.24~=1.09, *P*=.36) in the total sample ([Tables 2](#) and [3](#)). Among participants who consumed less than 2 pieces of fruit at baseline (n=803), a significant difference in change over time was found between the groups (*F*~4.523.71~=3.61, *P*=.007). The plus group had a significantly larger increase in fruit intake than the control group, between baseline and both T1 (plus vs control: ES =0.25, *P*=.01) and T2 (plus vs control: ES =0.37, *P*=.001). At medium term, the plus version also resulted in a larger increase in fruit intake than the basic version (plus vs basic: ES =0.22, *P*=.04) ([Tables 4](#) and [5](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

The same results were found in the risk group: vegetable intake increased over time (*F*~2,654.00~=72.11, *P*<.001), but no difference between the 3 groups was found (*F*~4,671.86~=2.15, *P*=.07)([Tables 4](#) and [5](#)). ### High-Energy Snack Intake High-energy snack intake had a very skewed distribution and, therefore, was log-transformed. The significance tests were based on the log-transformed variable, but the unstandardized regression coefficients and ES were based on the original variable. In the total sample, there was a significant difference in decrease of high-energy snacks between the groups (*F*~4,933.35~=5.77, *P*<.001). Both intervention groups had a significantly larger decrease in high-energy snack intake than the control group between baseline and both T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.30, *P*<.001; plus vs control: ES =--0.29, *P*=.001) and T2 (basic vs control: ES =--0.18, *P*=.006; plus vs control: ES =--0.27, *P*=.002) ([Tables 2](#) and [3](#)). Stratified analyses showed that for lower-educated participants both the basic and plus version resulted in a larger decrease than the control intervention between baseline and T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.33, *P*<.001; plus vs control: ES =--0.23, *P*=.02). Between baseline and T2, only the basic version resulted in a larger decrease than the control intervention (basic vs control: ES =--0.23, *P*=.009). For high-educated participants, both intervention groups had a larger decrease than the control group between baseline and T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.31, *P*=.006; plus vs control: ES =--0.38, *P*=.01*).* Between baseline and T2, the plus version resulted in a larger decrease than the control intervention (plus vs control: ES =--0.53, *P*<.001) and basic version (plus vs basic: ES =--0.32, *P*=.04). Also in the risk group (n=808), significant differences in change over time were found (*F*~4,534.96~=4.30, *P*=.002). Both intervention groups had a significant larger decrease than the control group between baseline and T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.34, *P*<.001; plus vs control: ES =--0.38, *P*=.001) and T2 (basic vs control: ES =--0.20, *P*=.02; plus vs control: ES =--0.32, *P*=.008) ([Tables 4](#) and [5](#)). Stratified analyses showed that among lower-educated participants only the basic version resulted in a larger decrease in high-energy snack intake than the control intervention between baseline and both T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.40, *P*=.002) and T2 (basic vs control: ES =--0.26, *P*=.03). For higher-educated participants, both intervention groups had a larger decrease than the control group between baseline and T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.34, *P*=.02; plus vs control: ES=--0.50, *P*=.001). Between baseline and T2, the plus version resulted in a larger decrease than the control intervention (plus vs control: ES =--0.64, *P*<.001) and basic version (plus vs basic: ES =--0.38, *P*=.03). ### Fat Intake Differences in change over time between the groups were found (*F*~4,919.65~=3.02, *P*=.02) in the total sample. The basic group had a larger decrease in saturated fat intake than the control group between baseline and both T1 (basic vs control: ES =--0.19, *P*=.001) and T2 (basic vs control: ES =--0.17, *P*=.01). In addition, the decrease between baseline and T1 was significantly smaller for the plus group compared to the basic group (plus vs basic: ES =0.12, *P*=.045) ([Tables 2](#) and [3](#)). Also in the risk group (n=627), differences in change over time between the groups were found (*F*~4,441.26~=2.99, *P*=.02). The basic group had a significantly larger decrease in saturated fat intake than the control group between baseline and both T1 (basic vs control: ES=--0.28, *P*=.006) and T2 (basic vs control: ES=--0.28, *P*=.01). Between baseline and T1, the decrease was lower for the plus group than for the basic group (plus vs basic: ES =0.24, *P*=.02) ([Tables 4](#) and [5](#)).\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background and purpose The trabecular metal tibial monoblock component (TM) is a relatively new option available for total knee arthroplasty. We have previously reported a large degree of early migration of the trabecular metal component in a subset of patients. These implants all appeared to stabilize at 2 years. We now present 5-year RSA results of the TM and compare them with those of the NexGen Option Stemmed cemented tibial component (Zimmer, Warsaw IN). ## Patients and methods 70 patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to receive either the TM implant or the cemented component. RSA examination was done postoperatively and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years. RSA outcomes were translations, rotations, and maximum total point motion (MTPM) of the components. MTPM values were used to classify implants as \"at risk\" or \"stable\". ## Results At the 5-year follow-up, 45 patients were available for analysis. There were 27 in the TM group and 18 in the cemented group. MTPM values were similar in the 2 groups (p = 0.9). The TM components had significantly greater subsidence than the cemented components (p = 0.001). The proportion of \"at risk\" components at 5 years was 2 of 18 in the cemented group and 0 of 27 in the TM group (p = 0.2). ## Interpretation In the previous 2-year report, we expressed our uncertainty concerning the long-term stability of the TM implant due to the high initial migration seen in some cases. Here, we report stability of this implant up to 5 years in all cases. The implant appears to achieve solid fixation despite high levels of migration initially. # Results ## Standard outcomes and follow-up All standard outcome measures for the 45 patients in this study are given in [Table 1](#). Originally, 37 patients were randomized to receive the trabecular metal component and 33 received the cemented component. Age and BMI were similar in the 2 groups at the time of admission. There were no differences in subjective measures (WOMAC) between implant groups at any follow-up point. ::::table-wrap\n",

There were 27/28 of the trabecular metal subjects and 18/21 cemented subjects with 2-year data recruited. The reasons for loss to follow-up for the other 25 patients are documented in [Figure 1](#) and it happened mainly in the first two years of follow-up. Of the patients with a high degree of prosthesis migration in the original study, all 9 were recruited to the 5-year follow-up. All but 3 of the patients originally recruited to the study are still being followed by the operative surgeon, and there have been no revisions to date. The three patients who were exceptions had left the province. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram.</figcaption> </figure> ## RSA results The accuracy of the RSA system was 0.025 mm, 0.025 mm, 0.063 mm, and 0.026 mm for the x-, y-, and z- directions and maximum total point motion, respectively. The precision of the RSA system was 0.07 mm, 0.07 mm, and 0.11 mm for x-, y-, and z- translations, 0.16°, 0.15°, and 0.12° for x-, y-, and z- rotations, and 0.10 mm for maximum total point motion. At the 2-year follow-up, there were no subjects \"at risk\" in the trabecular metal group (0/28). At the 5-year follow-up, none of the trabecular metal components were found to be \"at risk\". At the 2-year follow-up, there were 4 subjects \"at risk\" in the cemented group (4/21). At the 5-year follow-up, 1 of the cemented components \"at risk\" was lost to follow-up, 2 stabilized (0.09 mm and 0.07 mm of movement between 2 and 5 years) and 1 continued to migrate (0.35 mm of movement between 2 and 5 years). 1 of the cemented implants found to be stable at 2 years migrated an additional 0.42 mm and was classified as being \"at risk\". However, retrospectively, this implant had somewhat anomalous 2-year data (0.64 mm, 0.45 mm, and 0.87 mm at 1, 2, and 5 years), where the difference between 1 year and 5 years would make the implant appear stable (0.23 mm in 4 years) but the difference between 2 years and 5 years would make the implant appear to be continuously migrating (0.42 mm in 3 years). The condition number and mean errors for this subject were within normal limits. All other implants that were found to be stable at 2 years migrated less than 0.3 mm between the 2- and 5-year follow-up, and were still classified as stable. The proportion of \"at risk\" components at 5 years was 2 of 18 (0.11, 95% CI: 0.03--0.33) in the cemented group and was 0 of 27 (95% CI: 0.0--0.13) in the trabecular metal group (p = 0.2). At the 5-year follow-up, there was no difference in MTPM between the cemented group and the trabecular metal group (p = 0.9) ([Table 2](#) and [Figure 2](#)). MTPM values for individual subjects are shown in [Figure 3](#). Compared to the cemented components, the trabecular metal tibial components had more subsidence (p = 0.001) ([Table 2](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

Using the marker configuration models, independent bead motion was detected in 5 of the high-migration cases, between the postoperative and 6-month follow-up examinations. The error of fit of the model marker was reduced dramatically (0.103 mm to 0.0466 mm on average) when the bead in question was removed from the analysis. The position of the bead with respect to that of the bead in the model was inferior, indicating that the motion was not due to loose beads, which would have traveled radially. The magnitude of independent bead motion was from 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm in all 5 cases. At the 5-year follow-up, there was no change in the position of the independently moving bead---indicating that the deformation of the base plate was permanent.\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background Few clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells for the management of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the safety and tolerability and to explore the efficacy of a single intra-articular injection of allogeneic human mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) to improve clinical symptoms and retard joint structural deterioration over 24 months in patients following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. ## Methods In this phase Ib/IIa, double-blind, active comparator clinical study, 17 patients aged 18--40 years with unilateral ACL reconstruction were randomized (2:1) to receive either a single intra-articular injection of 75 million allogeneic MPCs suspended in hyaluronan (HA) (MPC + HA group) (*n* = 11) or HA alone (*n* = 6). Patients were monitored for adverse events. Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-HLA panel reactive antibodies (PRA) against class I and II HLAs determined by flow cytometry. Pain, function, and quality of life were assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and SF-36v2 scores. Joint space width was measured from radiographs, and tibial cartilage volume and bone area assessed from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ## Results Moderate arthralgia and swelling within 24 h following injection that subsided were observed in 4 out of 11 in the MPC + HA group and 0 out of 6 HA controls. No cell-related serious adverse effects were observed. Increases in class I PRA >10% were observed at week 4 in the MPC + HA group that decreased to baseline levels by week 104. Compared with the HA group, MPC + HA-treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain, symptom, activities of daily living, and SF-36 bodily pain scores (*p* < 0.05). The MPC + HA group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing (*p* < 0.05), less tibial bone expansion (0.5% vs 4.0% over 26 weeks, *p* = 0.02), and a trend towards reduced tibial cartilage volume loss (0.7% vs --4.0% over 26 weeks, *p* = 0.10) than the HA controls. ## Conclusions Intra-articular administration of a single allogeneic MPC injection following ACL reconstruction was safe, well tolerated, and may improve symptoms and structural outcomes. These findings suggest that MPCs warrant further investigations as they may modulate some of the pathological processes responsible for the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis following ACL reconstruction. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov ([NCT01088191](#)) registration date: March 11, 2010﻿ ## Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13075-017-1391-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. # Results ## Baseline characteristics of study participants The baseline characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table [2](#). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, gender, body mass index, tibial cartilage volume, tibial bone area, joint space width, tibial cartilage volume, or bone area. Apart from the KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) scores for the HA injected individuals, both groups exhibited KOOS baseline scores that were below the cut-off scores for individuals with physical problems associated with injured knees [[7](#)]. However, participants in the MPC + HA group reported worse KOOS pain (*p* = 0.02), symptoms (*p* < 0.001), ADL score (*p* = 0.047), and SF-36v2 bodily pain (*p* = 0.01) score than the HA-alone group at baseline. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between completers and non-completers at 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up as shown in Fig. [1](#) (Additional files [1](#), [2](#) and [3](#): Tables S1--S3). ::::table-wrap\n",

In the HA-alone group, only 1 out of 4 patients had increases in class I PRA >10% at week 4, and this level was maintained through to week 104. None of the study participants exhibited clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or blood chemistry laboratory results over the course of the study. No major changes in vital signs were reported following injection of the test substances, nor were there notable changes from baseline in the physical examination data. No ectopic tissue formation was noted from the blinded MRI evaluations. ## Serious adverse events Two serious adverse events, fracture of the humerus and infective bursitis, were reported for patients in the MPC + HA group after week 52. These were not considered to be treatment related. ## Effect of MPCs on knee pain, function, and quality of life over 24 months There was an improvement from baseline in both groups for all the KOOS dimensions over 24 months (Fig. [2](#), Additional file [4](#): Table S4).

There was also an improvement over 24 months in both groups for all SF-36 physical components except for general health perception (Fig. [2](#), Additional file [5](#): Table S5). However, statistically significant differences between treatments were only observed for bodily pain at 6, 12, and 24 months (*p* = 0.02, 0.05, and 0.03, respectively), where injection with the MPH + HA preparation was found to be more beneficial than HA alone (Fig. [2](#), Additional file [5](#): Table S5). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Change from baseline in <strong>a–c</strong> Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (<em>KOOS</em>) (pain scores (<strong>a</strong>), symptom scores (<strong>b</strong>), and activities of daily living (<em>ADL</em>) scores (<strong>c</strong>)), and <strong>d</strong> SF-36 physical component scores over 24 months (mean and 95% confidence interval shown). *<em>p</em> &lt;﻿ 0.05﻿ <em>HA</em> hyaluronan, <em>MPC</em> mesenchymal precursor cell</figcaption> </figure> ## Effect of MPCs on tibial cartilage volume change over 24 months There was no significant difference in annual change in medial or lateral tibial cartilage volume between the MPC + HA and HA-alone groups over 6, 12, and 24 months (Table [4](#)).

      "# Abstract ## Background Increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) is observed in psoriasis. Metformin has shown improvement in cardiovascular risk factors while pioglitazone demonstrated anti proliferative, anti-inflammatory and anti angiogenic effects. Study objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Insulin sensitizers (metformin and pioglitazone) in psoriasis patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). ## Methods Single centre, parallel group, randomized, study of metformin, pioglitazone and placebo in psoriasis patients with MS. ## Results Statistically significant improvement was observed in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Erythema, Scaling and Induration (ESI) and Physician global assessment (PGA) scores in pioglitazone (*p* values -- PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.002, PGA = 0.008) and metformin groups (*p* values -- PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.016, PGA = 0.012) as compared to placebo. There was statistically significant difference in percentage of patients achieving 75 % reduction in PASI and ESI scores in metformin (*p* value -- PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.001) and pioglitazone groups (*p* vaue -- PASI = 0.001, ESI = 0.001). Significant improvement was observed in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and triglycerides levels in metformin and pioglitazone arms. Significant improvement was noted in weight, BMI, waist circumference, FPG, triglycerides and total cholesterol after 12 weeks of treatment with metformin while pioglitazone showed improvement in FPG, triglyceride levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. There was no difference in pattern of adverse drug reaction in three groups. ## Conclusion Insulin sensitizers have shown improvement in the parameters of MS as well as disease severity in psoriasis patients. ## Trial registration CTRI Registration Number: [ CTRI/2011/12/002252](#). Registered on 19/12/2011. # Results A total of 83 consecutive adult psoriasis patients with MS were screened from June 2010 to April 2011 (Fig. [1](#)). Out of 83 patients, 23 were excluded from the study. 23, 16 and 21 patients were randomized to placebo, pioglitazone and metformin treatment groups respectively. Disposition of patients and reasons for withdrawal were summarized in Fig. [1](#). Hence, 21 patients in placebo arm, 16 in pioglitazone and 18 patients in metformin arm completed the study. As Intention to treat analysis with last observation carry forward (LOCF) was done, so all the subjects as randomized were included for final analysis. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flowchart of the patients enrolled in the study depicting enrollment, withdrawal and follow up of the subjects</figcaption> </figure> No significant difference was observed in baseline demographics and MS characteristics among three treatment groups except past history of remission (Table [1](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Asthma is the most common chronic condition of childhood and disproportionately affects inner-city minority children. Low rates of asthma preventer medication adherence is a major contributor to poor asthma control in these patients. Web-based methods have potential to improve patient knowledge and medication adherence by providing interactive patient education, monitoring of symptoms and medication use, and by facilitation of communication and teamwork among patients and health care providers. Few studies have evaluated web-based asthma support environments using all of these potentially beneficial interventions. The multidimensional website created for this study, BostonBreathes, was designed to intervene on multiple levels, and was evaluated in a pilot trial. ## Methods An interactive, engaging website for children with asthma was developed to promote adherence to asthma medications, provide a platform for teamwork between caregivers and patients, and to provide primary care providers with up-to-date symptom information and data on medication use. Fifty-eight (58) children primarily from inner city Boston with persistent-level asthma were randomised to either usual care or use of BostonBreathes. Subjects completed asthma education activities, and reported their symptoms and medication use. Primary care providers used a separate interface to monitor their patients' website use, their reported symptoms and medication use, and were able to communicate online via a discussion board with their patients and with an asthma specialist. ## Results After 6-months, reported wheezing improved significantly in both intervention and control groups, and there were significant improvements in the intervention group only in night-time awakening and parental loss of sleep, but there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups in these measures. Emergency room or acute visits to a physician for asthma did not significantly change in either group. Among the subgroup of subjects with low controller medication adherence at baseline, adherence improved significantly only in the intervention group. Knowledge of the purpose of controller medicine increased significantly in the intervention group, a statistically significant improvement over the control group. ## Conclusions This pilot study suggests that a multidimensional web-based educational, monitoring, and communication platform may have positive influences on pediatric patients' asthma-related knowledge and use of asthma preventer medications. # Results 983 children with asthma were identified through automated medical record review. Of these, 520 (52.9%) were able to be reached and had an eligible physician, 391 (75.2%) completed a phone screening, and 89 (22.8%) were deemed eligible for the study. Of the 89 eligible subjects, 31 declined to participate leaving 58 (65%) enrolled with 21 randomized to the control group, and 37 randomized to the intervention group. See Figure  [2](#) for Consort diagram. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Consort Diagram.</strong></figcaption> </figure> At the 6 month end-point, the control group retained 14 (66.7%) of enrolled subjects, and intervention group retained 28 (75.7%) of subjects. The other subjects were lost to follow-up before the 6 month end point. Analysis of the randomness of missing data for days of wheeze, days had to slow down, nights woke-up, days limited activity, days parent lose sleep and days missed school for asthma using the permutation test indicated no significant dependence of drop out on the outcome values. Thirteen [ [13](#) ] physicians and 1 NP participated in the study of whom 61% were female, the mean age was 45 years old, 95% were located in an urban practice area, 22% were family physicians and 78% were pediatricians or pediatric NP. Characteristics of the subjects are described in Table  [1](#) . Overall, 58.6% of subjects were African-American, and 32.6% of household reported earning less than $15,000 per year. Most subjects (87.5%) had some form of health insurance. Parents of control subjects were slightly more likely to report high school education or above (78.4% of intervention subject parents, versus 100% of control parents, P = 0.041). ::::table-wrap\n",

Results of the provider survey on experience with BB are shown in Table  [5](#) . Providers tended toward agreement that BB provided useful information; was easy to use; that their patients benefited from using BB; and that the asthma specialist feedback was useful. Responses were neutral on effectiveness of the discussion board for communication with patients, and on average, expressed neutral to slight disagreement on adequacy of time available to use BB, and if they had changed management based on BB data. Open-ended comments grouped into three consistent themes: the observation that BB improved communication with patients, the advantages of having access to information on patient asthma status on a more immediate, day to day, basis; and that the time commitment to use the system was a concern. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Chronic work-related stress is an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases and associated mortality, particularly when compounded by a sedentary work environment. The purpose of this study was to determine if an office worksite-based *hatha* yoga program could improve physiological stress, evaluated *via* heart rate variability (HRV), and associated health-related outcomes in a cohort of office workers. ## Methods Thirty-seven adults employed in university-based office positions were randomized upon the completion of baseline testing to an experimental or control group. The experimental group completed a 10-week yoga program prescribed three sessions per week during lunch hour (50 min per session). An experienced instructor led the sessions, which emphasized *asanas* (postures) and *vinyasa* (exercises). The primary outcome was the high frequency (HF) power component of HRV. Secondary outcomes included additional HRV parameters, musculoskeletal fitness (i.e. push-up, side-bridge, and sit & reach tests) and psychological indices (i.e. state and trait anxiety, quality of life and job satisfaction). ## Results All measures of HRV failed to change in the experimental group versus the control group, except that the experimental group significantly increased LF:HF (p = 0.04) and reduced pNN50 (p = 0.04) versus control, contrary to our hypotheses. Flexibility, evaluated *via* sit & reach test increased in the experimental group versus the control group (p < 0.001). No other adaptations were noted. *Post hoc* analysis comparing participants who completed ≥70% of yoga sessions (n = 11) to control (n = 19) yielded the same findings, except that the high adherers also reduced state anxiety (p = 0.02) and RMSSD (p = 0.05), and tended to improve the push-up test (p = 0.07) versus control. ## Conclusions A 10-week *hatha* yoga intervention delivered at the office worksite during lunch hour did not improve HF power or other HRV parameters. However, improvements in flexibility, state anxiety and musculoskeletal fitness were noted with high adherence. Future investigations should incorporate strategies to promote adherence, involve more frequent and longer durations of yoga training, and enrol cohorts who suffer from higher levels of work-related stress. ## Trial registration [ACTRN12611000536965](#) # Results ## Flow of participants Forty-two individuals (n = 42) expressed an interest in the study, and were deemed eligible; five withdrew prior to baseline testing with reasons presented in Figure [1](#). Thirty-seven individuals provided written informed consent, completed baseline testing, and were randomized to the yoga (n = 18) or control group (n = 19). One participant in the yoga group withdrew in week 2 for personal reasons, while two in the control group failed to complete follow-up testing. Recruitment resulted in lower participant interest and enrolment than anticipated [[22](#)], and therefore our *a priori* calculation of statistical power was reduced from 80% to 63%. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Flow of participants.</strong> * Baseline data carried forward for 1 yoga and 2 control participants lost to follow-up.</figcaption> </figure> ## Baseline characteristics Participant characteristics are presented in Table [1](#). No statistically significant differences were observed between groups at baseline on the descriptive characteristics presented. However, due to potentially clinically important differences in BMI (p = 0.09), this variable was included as a covariate in all ANCOVA models. The cohort ranged in age from 21 to 58 years. BMI ranged from 18.3 to 39.2 kg/m^2^, and seven participants fulfilled the clinical criteria for obesity (i.e. BMI ≥30.0 kg/m^2^). Two participants were current smokers, while one had a history of tobacco use but did not currently smoke. Other than obesity, the most common chronic conditions were asthma (n = 4), hypercholesterolemia (n = 4) and hypertension (n = 5). None of the participants were presently engaged in regular yoga practice but nearly half had prior experience at a beginner level (17/37, 46%). The majority of participants were administrative staff, technical support staff, or post-graduate students. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## OBJECTIVE Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular mortality and increases adiponectin concentrations, but effects might differ according to sex and beverage consumed. ## RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 72 healthy individuals (22--56 years) were enrolled in this randomized controlled crossover trial. After washout, two interventions for 3 weeks followed: ethanol (concentration 12.5%), beer (5.6%), or red wine (12.5%) equivalent to 30 g ethanol/day for men and 20 g/day for women or the same de-alcoholized beverages or water. Adiponectin was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ## RESULTS Among women, adiponectin significantly increased after consuming red wine (29.8%, *P* < 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, *P* < 0.05) and consuming beer (16.1%, *P* < 0.05). De-alcoholized beverages had no substantial effect on adiponectin concentrations. ## CONCLUSIONS Moderate amounts of ethanol-containing beverages increased adiponectin concentrations, but sex-specific effects might depend on type of beverage consumed. # RESULTS Compliance was excellent according to self-report and counting of empty bottles returned. One participant was excluded because of protocol violation. Baseline characteristics including age, BMI, and liver enzymes did not differ within sexes and between intervention groups. Adiponectin concentrations were substantially higher among females (means 7.6--8.8 μg/ml) than males (means 4.8--6.3 μg/ml) but also did not differ between the intervention groups within each sex. Among females, adiponectin significantly increased after intervention with red wine (29.8%, *P* < 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, *P* < 0.05) and beer consumption (16.1%, *P* < 0.04).

      "# Abstract ## Background Elobixibat is a minimally absorbed ileal bile acid (BA) transporter (IBAT) inhibitor in development against chronic constipation (CC) and constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C). CC is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type2 diabetes mellitus. The objectives of this study were to evaluate metabolic effects of elobixibat. Effects on plasma lipids and BA synthesis were evaluated utilizing a 4-week, placebo-controlled study in patients with dyslipidemia while changes of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by elobixibat was assayed in samples from a 14 day high-dose elobixibat study in patients with CC. ## Methods Thirty-six dyslipidemic patients, 21 females, mean age 63 years, were randomized to 2.5 mg or 5 mg elobixibat or placebo once daily for four weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondary endpoints included other lipid parameters and serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a marker of BA (bile acid) synthesis. Another study, in 36 patients with CC treated with high dose elobixibat; 15 mg or 20 mg/day or placebo for 14 days, was evaluated for changes in GLP-1. ## Results In the dyslipidemia study LDL cholesterol was reduced by 7.4 % ( *p* = 0.044), and the LDL/HDL ratio was decreased by 18 % (*p* = 0.004). Serum C4 increased, indicating that BA synthesis was induced. No serious adverse events were recorded. In the CC study, GLP-1 increased significantly in both the 15 mg (20.7 ± 2.4 pmol/L; *p* = 0.03) and the 20 mg group (25.6 ± 4.9 pmol/L; *p* = 0.02). ## Conclusions Elobixibat reduces LDL cholesterol and LDL/HDL ratio and increase circulating peak GLP-1 levels, the latter in line with increased intestinal BA mediated responses in humans. ## Trial registrations ClinicalTrial.gov: [NCT01069783](#) and [NCT01038687](#) . # Results ## Results of the dyslipidemia study ### Patient flow and follow-up The study flow and patient demographics is shown in Fig. [1](#). Out of 81 screened subjects, 36 patients fulfilled eligibility criteria, entered the study and were randomized to treatment with elobixibat or placebo. All patients completed the study; the ITT and the Safety population include the same patients. At baseline, the demographic parameters were similar between the treatment groups (Table [1A](#)). Patients had a mean age of 63 years (range 34--80) and there was a slight preponderance for women (58 %). Baseline lipid profiles were similar across the groups (Table [ 1A](#)). No changes in safety laboratory values, including liver enzymes and plasma glucose, were identified during the study. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Patient flow chart in the Dyslipidemia study</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

No significant change was achieved for the 2.5 mg elobixibat cohort. When analyzing the mean and median change values from baseline to Days 14 and 28, there was a more prominent reduction in the drug-treated groups as compared to placebo whereas on day 42 (14 days after cessation of treatment) there was no clear difference. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Median % changes (interquartile 25–75 % range) from baseline for plasma total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, LDL/HDL ratio and triglycerides (TG) in the Dyslipidemia study. *: <em>p</em> = 0.044 **: <em>p</em> = 0.004 (Wilcoxon)</figcaption> </figure> Elobixibat treatment did not significantly alter total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides (Fig. [2](#)).

AEs were most prevalent in the placebo group (92 % of the patients reported 27 AEs). In the 2.5 mg and 5 mg treatment groups, 50 % and 67 % of the patients reported a total of 11 and 14 AEs respectively. Most of the AEs were recorded as mild and transient and only four were moderate, two in the placebo group and two in the 5 mg group; none of them were judged to be related to the study drug. No patient discontinued the study. Table [2](#) outlines the incidence of AEs. The most common AEs were headache, diarrhea and constipation. Notably, diarrhea was reported in 3 patients on placebo, 2 patients on 2.5 mg and 3 patients on 5 mg. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objective To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of once-daily 1200 mg and 2400 mg SPN-804 (Oxtellar XR™, Supernus Pharmaceuticals), an extended-release tablet formulation of oxcarbazepine (OXC), added to 1-3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in adults with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization. ## Methods The Prospective, Randomized Study of OXC XR in Subjects with Partial Epilepsy Refractory (PROSPER) study was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 3 study. The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly (28-day) seizure frequency for the 16-week double-blind treatment period in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with analyzable seizure data. Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50% seizure reduction, proportion of patients seizure free, and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration. ## Results Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, −38.2% (*P *=* *0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and −42.9% (*P *=* *0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg. Responder rates were 28.1%, 36.1% (*P *=* *0.08), and 40.7% (*P *=* *0.02); 16-week seizure-free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3%, 4.9% (*P *=* *0.59), and 11.4% (*P *=* *0.008), respectively. When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters, a *post hoc* analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: −13.3%; 1200 mg: −34.5%, *P *=* *0.02; 2400 mg: −52.7%, *P *=* *0.006) in the North American study site cluster. A concentration--response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg. Adverse event types reflected the drug's established profile. Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate-release OXC. Once-daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals. ## Conclusions Adjunctive once-daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures. Adverse event occurrence and discontinuations due to adverse events suggest improved tolerability vs previously published data with immediate-release OXC. # Results ## Patient disposition and characteristics Of 440 patients screened, 366 patients were randomized to once-daily placebo (*n *=* *121), SPN-804 1200 mg (*n *=* *122), and SPN-804 2400 mg (*n *= 123). Analyzable seizure data for the primary efficacy analysis were available for 96.7% (*n *=* *117), 89.3% (*n *=* *109), and 90.3% (*n *=* *111), respectively (Fig. [1](#)). Of the 111 patients in the 2400-mg group with analyzable seizure data, 26 were patients in whom SPN-804 was down-titrated to 1800 mg/day. Overall, 67.8% of patients completed 16 weeks, with 21.5% of placebo patients discontinuing prematurely compared with 32.8% and 42.3% in the 1200-mg and 2400-mg SPN-804 groups, respectively. The most common reason for study withdrawal was adverse events, accounting for the higher discontinuation rates in the active treatment groups. Based on pill counts, 96.0% (placebo), 93.2% (1200 mg), and 95.1% (2400 mg) of patients were adherent with once-daily dosing. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Study disposition for patients assigned to placebo or Oxtellar XR (SPN-804).</figcaption> </figure> Treatment groups were generally well balanced in terms of baseline demographics and disease characteristics (Table [1](#)). Overall, the mean age was 38.9 years; 55.2% of patients were women. The mean number of years since epilepsy diagnosis was 20.8 years; median monthly seizure frequency at baseline was 6.5 seizures despite ongoing treatment with two or three concomitant AEDs in 67.2% of patients. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "One patient assigned to SPN-804 2400 mg was receiving 4 AEDs.:::: ## Efficacy The median percent seizure frequency change over the 16-week double-blind treatment period was −28.7% with placebo vs −38.3% (*P *=* *0.08) for once-daily 1200-mg and −42.9% (*P *=* *0.003) in the 2400-mg group (Fig. [2](#)). The estimated treatment difference favoring SPN-804 over placebo was −10.3% (95% CI: −22.3, 1.2) for 1200-mg and −18.3% (95% CI: −30.4, −5.8) for 2400-mg group. Secondary endpoints generally mirrored the primary efficacy analysis. Responder rates, that is, proportion of patients with ≥50% seizure frequency reduction (Fig. [2](#)), were placebo, 28.1%; 1200 mg, 36.1% (*P *=* *0.08); and 40.7% (*P *=* *0.02) of those receiving 2400 mg. The odds ratio comparing the responder rates was 1.67 (95% CI: 0.95, 2.94) for SPN-804 1200 mg vs placebo and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.13, 3.50) when comparing 2400 mg and placebo. For the prespecified pragmatic ITT analysis of seizure freedom, 3.3% of the placebo group, 4.9% (*P *=* *0.53) in the 1200-mg group, and 11.4% (*P *=* *0.008) in the 2400-mg group were seizure free for the entire 16-week blinded treatment period. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Oxtellar XR (SPN-804) vs placebo: Median percent reduction from baseline 28-day seizure frequency (A) and responder rate (B) for the 16-week double-blind treatment period in ITT population with analyzable data. *<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.003; **<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.02 vs placebo. ITT, intent-to-treat.</figcaption> </figure> Sensitivity analyses using a completer and a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis did not change the primary statistical outcome that once-daily SPN-804 2400 mg was shown to be significantly superior to placebo, whereas 1200 mg was not. However, in a sensitivity analysis evaluating the potential influence of regional differences in this multinational trial, both SPN-804 dosage groups were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction -- placebo, −13.3%; 1200 mg, −34.5% (*P *=* *0.02); 2400 mg, −52.7% (*P *=* *0.006) among patients (*n *=* *106) participating at North American study sites (Fig. [3](#)). The estimated treatment difference favoring SPN-804 over placebo was −26.1% (95% CI: −47.9, −4.1) for 1200-mg and −35.3% (95% CI: −59.1, −12.5) for 2400-mg group. In contrast, with the substantially higher placebo effect (-33.2%) observed in patients (*n *=* *231) from the Eastern Europe/Russia study site cluster (Fig. [3](#)), neither SPN-804 dosage group was significantly superior to placebo (1200 mg: −38.4%, *P *=* *0.60; 2400 mg: −41.2%, *P *=* *0.13) in this subset. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Oxtellar XR (SPN-804) vs placebo: Median percent reduction from baseline 28-day seizure frequency in the North American cluster of study sites (A) and Eastern Europe/Russia cluster (B) in the ITT population. *<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.02; **<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.006 vs placebo. ITT, intent-to-treat.</figcaption> </figure> After 16 weeks of double-blind treatment, PGIC score changes were not significantly different for either SPN-804 dosage vs placebo. Mean total QOLIE-31 and subscale scores did not decrease from baseline during SPN-804 or placebo administration in any group. The only significant differences from placebo in QOLIE-31 score changes were significantly smaller increases in the QOLIE-31 subscales of Cognitive Functioning in the 1200-mg and Medication Effects in both SPN-804 groups (*P *<* *0.01 vs placebo). ## Tolerability and safety The overall incidence of adverse events (Table [2](#)) was similar in the placebo (55.4%) and SPN-804 1200-mg groups (56.6%) and was lower than in patients assigned to 2400 mg (69.1%). The incidences of specific adverse events were generally similar for the placebo and SPN-804 1200-mg groups. The most common adverse events were those related to the nervous system, occurring in 31.4% of placebo patients and 38.5% of those receiving 1200 mg, compared with 56.1% in the 2400-mg group. The most frequently reported adverse events -- dizziness, nausea, somnolence, vomiting, headache, and diplopia -- were typically dose related. Treatment-limiting adverse event rates were 8.3% and 14.8% in the placebo and 1200-mg groups, respectively; 30.1% in the 2400-mg group discontinued due to adverse events. In the active treatment groups, adverse events resulting in discontinuation occurred primarily during the forced-titration phase (1200 mg: 13/20, 65%; 2400 mg: 26/37, 70%). The fact that 23 patients were down-titrated to 1800 mg also suggests some difficulty with tolerability at 2400 mg. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "*N*, total number of patients; *n*, number of patients.:::: Serious adverse events occurred in seven patients each in the placebo (5.8%) and SPN-804 1200-mg (5.7%) groups and in 10 (8.1%) in the 2400-mg group. Of the adverse events classified as serious, none were considered study drug-related in the SPN-804 1200-mg group and three were considered study drug-related in the placebo group (one subject each with erythematous rash, Stevens--Johnson syndrome, or dizziness). A fourth patient assigned to the placebo group was the only death in the study (death due to ovarian cancer diagnosed 2 days before randomization). Serious adverse events were considered study drug-related in six patients receiving SPN-804 2400 mg -- symptomatic hyponatremia (*n *=* *1), generalized rash (*n *=* *1), dizziness (*n *=* *1), vomiting (*n *=* *1), and general drug intolerance (*n *=* *2), which was characterized by other non-serious adverse events such as dizziness, diplopia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or headache. Study drug was discontinued in all patients with serious adverse events, although SPN-804 was initially down-titrated in one patient before being discontinued due to vertigo/dizziness. Only one clinically significant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG abnormality was observed during the study. A shift from normal to lower serum sodium levels was observed in a relatively small subset of patients receiving active treatment (placebo, 1.7%; 1200 mg, 9.8%; 2400 mg, 6.5%). Serum sodium levels were < 130 mEq/l at any point during double-blind treatment in nine patients receiving SPN-804 (1200 mg, *n *=* *4; 2400 mg, *n *=* *5) and < 125 mEq/l in two patients (one in each SPN-804 group). One occurrence of a markedly abnormal sodium value resulted in symptomatic hyponatremia and was classified as a serious adverse event. ## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics Based on population PK analysis of plasma MHD concentrations, the mean (SD) C~max~ of MHD was 17.9 (5.3) μg/ml in patients receiving once-daily SPN-804 1200-mg and 27.1 (8.7) μg/ml in the 2400-mg group; C~min~ concentrations were 12.0 (4.3) μg/ml and 19.4 (7.8) μg/ml, respectively. Clearance was increased 31% in patients receiving carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate as concomitant therapy, but was not increased further when more than one of these agents was given as co-therapy. In a concentration--response analysis, patients receiving SPN-804 were grouped according to estimated trough (C~min~) MHD concentrations. The breakpoint between subgroups (10 μg/ml) was determined by a sensitivity analysis. The overall median C~min~ across SPN-804 groups was 13.9 μg/ml. Median percent seizure frequency reduction was significantly greater in the subgroup with C~min~ ≥10 μg/ml MHD (*n *=* *125, −50%, *P *=* *0.02) compared with the <10 μg/ml subgroup (*n *=* *41, −35.2%) or the placebo group (*n = *117*,* −28.7%, *P *=* *0.0004); the difference in median percent change for <10 μg/ml subgroup vs placebo was not significant (*P *=* *0.57). The C~min~ was ≥ 10 μg/ml in approximately 85% of patients in the SPN-804 2400-mg group and 66% in the 1200-mg group.\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background Data about the vaccination status of participants are required in epidemiological cohort studies whenever infection or immunity is considered as potential exposure or outcome. Within Pretest 2 of the German National Cohort (GNC) we therefore investigated the acceptance and feasibility of extracting vaccination status from vaccination certificates provided by the participants of the study. ## Methods This study was conducted in three study centers (Bremen, n = 73; Hamburg, n = 200; Hannover, n = 193). In order to test if an additional reminder would prevent participants from forgetting their vaccination certificates at home persons willing to participate in Pretest 2 were randomly assigned to one of three invitation groups (IG). About one third of the participants received either no further reminder (IG1), a reminder card together with the appointment letter (IG2) or a separate reminder card 4 days before the appointment (IG3). At the study center, vaccination data were scanned or copied and entered into a database using a unique identification number. Participants were also asked to fill in a short questionnaire to assess the completeness of the provided vaccination data. Additionally, in one of the three participating study centers, general practitioners (GP) were asked to provide vaccination data from their records following respective participants' consent. Finally, we compared the influenza data from the vaccination certificates with the influenza data obtained from participants in Pretest 2 by use of a self-administered questionnaire (ID-Screen). ## Results Due to different starting dates of the study the intended reminder procedure was implemented only in Hamburg and Hannover. In Hamburg, significantly more vaccination certificates were submitted by the group which received the reminder card separately 4 days before the examination (IG3) compared to IG1 and IG2 (*p* = 0.04). In Hannover, in contrast, most vaccination certificates were brought by those who received the reminder card together with the appointment letter. Overall, the use of a reminder card had a positive but not significant effect as 89 % (185/209) of participants who received the reminder card submitted vaccination data versus 81 % (84/104) of participants who did not receive any reminder card (*p* = 0.06). Of all Pretest 2 participants in Hannover, 62 % (120/193) gave written consent for data collection by the GPs. In total, 114 practices were contacted of which 49 (43 %) sent vaccination data. All in all, 360 vaccination certificates with 5065 documented vaccinations were entered into a database, of which 4830 (95 %) were valid for analysis covering a period from 1946 to 2012. The comparison of influenza vaccination data from vaccination certificates to the remembered data from a self-completed questionnaire showed an agreement of data in 46 % (84/184) of cases (Kappa = 0.48). Influenza vaccinations were underreported in 4 % (7/170) of self-completed questionnaires. ## Conclusion The reliable documentation of vaccinations within the context of the GNC proved to be feasible and thus recommendable at a large scale within the GNC as participants showed high willingness and compliance in providing available vaccination documents. An additional validation by means of documents provided by physicians seems to be possible for more than a quarter of participants. In order to maximize the likelyhood of participants' of bringing their vaccination certificates it would be sufficient to send a reminder card together with the appointment letter. ## Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi: 10.1007/s00103-014-2050-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. # Results ## Participation The recruitment process for this feasibility study differed among the participating study centers. On the one hand, the invitation procedure consisting of three different invitation groups was implemented in Hamburg and Hannover only, due to a later starting date in Bremen. Consequently, all participants in Bremen invited to Pretest 2 received by default the reminder card together with the appointment letter. On the other hand, participation proportions for this feasibility study could be calculated for Hannover only, as in Bremen and Hamburg the consent for the vaccination data collection was integrated into the consent form of the Pretest 2 baseline assessment whereas in Hannover participants were asked for a separate consent. Recruitment data and participation proportions per invitation group are shown in Fig. [2](#). The participation proportions of the random samples are of special interest because the study protocol for the GNC allows random samples only; therefore, participation proportions will be discussed mainly in this respect. Overall, 400 persons were invited to participate in this feasibility study. In Hannover, 92.2 % (153/166) of Pretest 2 participants gave a separate written consent for the vaccination data collection. Again 92.2 % (141/153) of these participants brought vaccination certificates to the appointment. In Hamburg and Bremen, where participants were not explicitly asked for their willingness to participate in this feasibility study, the proportion of provided vaccination certificates was slightly lower: 80.0 % (128/160, one missing) of invited persons in Hamburg and 75.3 % (55/73) in Bremen provided vaccination data. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow chart of the recruitment and submitted vaccination certificates. <em>RS =</em> random sample from local registry, <em>CS</em> = convenience sample, consisting of volunteers, e.g. students, friends, colleagues and family members.

The approach to send a separate reminder card 4 days before the appointment was the most successful; 92 % (94/102) participants of IG3 provided vaccination data compared to 85 % (91/107) in IG2 (*p* = 0.06). Stratifications by study center indicated that in Hannover participants in IG2 provided the most vaccination certificates (95 %), whereas in Hamburg, significantly more vaccination certificates (92 %) were provided in IG3, with no differences between IG1 and IG2 (chi-square^2^: 6.546, df 2, *p* = 0.04). ## Data provided by physicians Of 193 Pretest 2 participants in Hannover, 120 (62 %) provided written consent for the data collection by general practitioners. In one case the consent was given but the participant had not been in contact with the health care system for a long time so that he could not provide any GP address. In total, 114 practices were contacted of which 43 % (49/114) sent vaccination data. Two practices did not send any data because no vaccination was given during the past 10 years. In most cases the medical staff filled in the paper documentation sheet, with a few providing computerized print-outs. ## Questionnaire The short questionnaire was completed by 94.7 % (426/450) of participants including the convenience sample. There were considerable differences between the study centers. Whereas in Hamburg all participants completed the questionnaire (200/200), this was the case for 98.9 % (175/177) of the participants in Hannover, and for only 70 % (51/73) in Bremen (data shown in supplement). Thorough data cleaning was necessary because of inconsistent responses. For example, the question, if the participant ever possessed a vaccination certificate was denied by 16 persons of whom 5 persons submitted their vaccination certificate to the study personnel the same day. A problem seemed to exist also if more than one vaccination certificate existed so that participants were not sure to which one to refer. Moreover the high percentage of missing answers for most questions, coded as \"don't know/no answer\", suggests that these questions were difficult to remember and thus not suitable for a self-administered questionnaire. Of all participants, 96 % had possessed a vaccination certificate once during their life-time, with 91 % possessing one at the moment. There were no differences between random and convenience samples. In all, 37 % of responders indicated that the present vaccination certificate was the first, whereas for 55 % of responders it was the second up to fourth vaccination certificate. In addition, 67 % answered to have brought all available vaccination data to the study center, 54 % included all vaccinations ever received (random sample). Tetanus (18 %), influenza (17 %) and vaccinations received in childhood (13 %) were indicated most often as vaccinations not included in documentation. The question regarding the attitude towards vaccinations was answered by 416/426 (98 %) participants. The attitude towards vaccinations was assessed by 74 % of responders as positive. Of those 18 % being critical, 45 % indicated fear the side effects of vaccinations and 30 % were concerned that vaccinations might overwhelm the immune system. Among other reasons, responders took the chance to explain more in detail their critical attitude against specific vaccinations like influenza vaccination because of bad experiences. Only one person indicated to be in principle opposed to vaccinations; for 8 % of responders vaccinations were no issues of concern. No statistical difference of attitude towards vaccination could be detected between persons who submitted their vaccination certificate compared to those who did not submit any vaccination data. ## Capturing and availability of vaccination data Overall 372 vaccination certificates were electronically captured or copied the same day of examination, of which 7 % (27/372) of vaccination certificates were lost primarily because of missing identification numbers (ID) on the copy/scan. The procedure of blackening the personal data before capturing the vaccination data electronically was not followed consequently so that in about 17 % of documents this needed to be worked over subsequently. The quality of vaccination certificates was partly poor, especially the older ones (before 1990) often lacked the names of given vaccines (1700 vaccines), or the date of vaccination. In 5 % (222) of cases, the vaccination date was missing, (partly) illegible or cut off during the process of scanning/copying the vaccination data. Some of these data (121 dates) could be recorded as described above. Further problems encountered were the lack of information about vaccines as single or combined vaccination or the illegibility of documented vaccinations. The median time for data entry was 14.3 min per vaccination certificate (minimum of 0.4 min; maximum of 124.3 min). Including the data of physicians, vaccination data could be obtained for a total of 82 % (367/450) of participants or 79 % (367/466) of all eligible Pretest 2 participants. An overview of submitted vaccination data per study center (number of valid vaccination documents and vaccinations) including the sample characteristics of persons submitting vaccination data is shown in Table [1](#). The documented vaccinations covered a period from 1946 to 2012. ::::table-wrap\n",

Most frequently documented vaccinations are shown in Table [2](#). Single vaccinations against poliomyelitis and tetanus were significantly more often, influenza vaccinations significantly less often documented in vaccination certificates than at the physicians' offices. To assess the quality of vaccination documentation, the data captured by vaccination certificates were compared to data provided by physicians. Using the example of tetanus, 27 persons provided tetanus vaccination information documented in vaccination certificates (125 vaccinations) as well as documented by physicians (54 vaccinations). In all, 30 % (38/125) of tetanus vaccinations documented in the vaccination certificates corresponded exactly with tetanus vaccinations documented by physicians for 20/27 persons (74 %). In these cases the date of vaccination, the kind of vaccine and the producer of the vaccine were documented identically in each document. A total of 6 % (7/125) of documented tetanus vaccinations in the vaccination certificates did not correspond to documented tetanus vaccinations by physicians for 6/27 persons (22 %). Tetanus documentation differed because either the name of the vaccine was missing, not consistent or different producers of vaccines were indicated. In addition, 8/54 (15 %) tetanus vaccinations documented by physicians were not documented in the vaccination certificates which accounts for at least 6 % (8/125) of tetanus vaccinations missing in the vaccination certificates. ::::table-wrap\n",

Three questions about influenza vaccination were included: whether an influenza vaccination has ever been received (V1), if yes, in which frequency (V2) and the year of the last influenza vaccination (V3). In total 365 persons answered the influenza questions. Vaccination documents were available for 78 % (284/365) of these participants, which allowed assessing the agreement of self-reported versus documented influenza vaccinations. Half of all responders (184/365) indicated having ever been vaccinated against the flu (Table [4](#)). Agreement with documentations was found for 84 (46 %) of these responders [Kappa 0.48] with up to 20 influenza vaccinations per person. Vaccination was underreported in 4 % (7/170) of cases where the receipt of influenza vaccination was negated but documented in the submitted vaccination records with up to 3 vaccinations per person. The \"unvaccinated\" responders were mostly vaccinated in 2008--2010 (7/11 vaccinations). The self-reported year of last influenza vaccination was confirmed by vaccination records in 27 % of cases (41/150). In 23 % (35/150) of cases the self-reported year did not correspond to the vaccination records because the year of the last remembered influenza vaccination was before (19 %) or after (5 %) the last influenza vaccination documented in the vaccination records. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract Acupressure on local and distal acupuncture points might result in sedation and relaxation, thereby reducing chronic neck pain. The aim was to investigate the effect of acupressure at local (LP) and distal acupuncture points (DP) in females with chronic neck pain. Thirty-three females were assigned to three groups: the control group did not receive any stimuli, the LP group received acupressure at local acupuncture points, GB 21, SI 14 and SI 15, and the DP group received acupressure at distal acupuncture points, LI 4, LI 10 and LI 11. Verbal rating scale (VRS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), muscle hardness (MH), salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) activity, heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) values and satisfaction due to acupressure were assessed. VRS, NDI, STAI and MH values decreased after acupressure in the LP and the DP group. HR decreased and the power of high frequency (HF) component of HRV increased after acupressure in only the LP group. Although acupressure on not only the LP but also the DP significantly improved pain conditions, acupressure on only the LP affected the autonomic nervous system while acupuncture points per se have different physical effects according to location. # 3. Results [Table 1](#) shows the demographic data of the three groups. There were no significant differences in age, weight, and pre-treatment values regarding pain conditions among the three groups ([Table 1](#)). There were no significant differences in all parameters in the control group. VRS ([Figure 3](#)), STAI-I ([Figure 4](#)), and MH ([Figure 5](#)) values significantly decreased immediately after treatment, and NDI ([Figure 6](#)) was lower at 1 day following treatment compared with pre-treatment in the LP and the DP groups. HR ([Figure 7](#)) significantly decreased and the HF component of HRV ([Figure 9](#)) significantly increased after treatment in the LP group only. There were no differences on the sAA and the LF components ([Figure 8](#)) and the LF/HF ratio ([Figure 10](#)) of HRV among the three groups. Satisfaction due to acupressure continued to 1 day after the treatment in the LP and the DP groups ([Figure 11](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Changes in pain intensity (VRS: verbal rating scale). ○: control group. ■: local acupuncture point (LP) group. □: distal acupuncture point (DP) group.

      "# Abstract ## Background It is important that potential study participants are appropriately informed and understand what is involved with their research participation. A few studies have examined study participants' understanding of the informed consent process and the adequacy of the information they received when agreeing to participate in a randomised controlled trial. Deficiencies in the consent process have been found. This topic remains an under researched area of acupuncture research. The aim of this study was to examine participants' understanding of their informed consent and the adequacy of the information presented when agreeing to participate in a randomised controlled trial of acupuncture. ## Methods All women who participated in a randomised controlled trial over an 11 month period were invited to participate in a survey. An anonymous self-completion questionnaire was designed and covered participants' understanding of informed consent in the clinical trial, their views of the information provided, the opportunity to ask questions, the use of sham acupuncture, their recall of study visits and processes for withdrawal, and their reason for participating in the trial. ## Results A response rate of 59 % was obtained. Over 90 % of subjects indicated there was plenty of opportunity to discuss the study prior to giving consent, and 89 % indicated that questions asked were answered to their satisfaction. The majority of women indicated the amount of information describing acupuncture was about right, however 24 % would have liked more. Information describing sham acupuncture was not considered adequate by 48 % of women, and 35 % would have liked more information, 30 % could not recall why, or were uncertain why a sham group was used. Participants indicated less understanding of the information relating to payment if they became ill due to study participation, risks and discomforts from the study interventions, which of the procedures were experimental and for how long they would be involved in the study. ## Conclusion Trial participants' understanding of informed consent was overall satisfactory but highlighted some areas of deficiency. Future studies could consider use of supplementary material such as Q and A fact sheets. # Results A total of 353 questionnaires were sent out and responses were received from 210 participants giving a response rate of 59 %. Responses to the survey indicated representation across Australian States and Territories, and from our three overseas recruitment sites in New Zealand. The majority of women completing the survey were aged over 35 years, and the majority were highly educated (Table [1](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

In addition 61 women (29 %) indicated the importance of undertaking research as a key reason for joining the trial. We sought women's views about the information they received and the opportunity to ask questions when considering their involvement in the study (Table [2](#)). Over 90 % indicated there was enough opportunity to discuss the study with the clinical staff before deciding to join the trial, and 89 % indicated that any questions they asked were answered to their satisfaction. The majority of women indicated the information describing acupuncture was about right, however 48 (24 %) would have liked more (Table [2](#)). Information describing sham acupuncture was not considered adequate by approximately half of the women, and 35 % would have liked more information. The role of educational status was examined in response these questions and we found women with tertiary education would have liked more information on acupuncture (*p* < 0.009), no other associations were found. ::::table-wrap\n",

Participant responses indicated some deficiencies. Over 82 % of responses indicated women could recall what a RCT meant. Responses were illustrated by the following quotations *\"I will be selected at random to be in the real or sham acupuncture group to assess the effect of acupuncture on live birth rates\"*. Many participants responded indicating their understanding of randomisation and blinding, for example, *\"that the person is randomly picked to be in the sham or real acupuncture group\", \"I will be allocated to either a treatment or a control group, blind study means I won't be aware of which group I was allocated to\"*. Some subjects responded by discussing the randomisation process, \"*its like a name in a hat you get randomly drawn to have either real or placebo acupuncture\",* and *\" where a computer randomly selects which group you will be in\"*. Incorrect responses reflected responses relating to blinding *\" no one knows which group you are in\", participants receive either sham or actual treatment without knowing which one\"*, or general responses relating to the purpose of the study \"*its a experiment used to test the effectiveness of something in this case the acupuncture meridians on the pregnancy success rates in IVF patients\".* We asked why was sham acupuncture used? Thirty percent could not recall why or were uncertain, and 69 % provided an explanation. Many described it in terms of a non-specific effect relating it to the placebo effect, *\"because it was the placebo treatment, you need to see whether the outcomes would be affected by receiving acupuncture or not\", \"to rule out the placebo effect, or to rule it in\", \"to see if it is all in the mind\"*. Others indicated their understanding of the use of a control group, *\" to determine if real acupuncture does actually cause more pregnancies\", \"as a control group to eliminate changes caused by bias or belief\", \"to see if specific points had results that can be compared against the sham results\". \"Sham acupuncture is used to control for the physiological and psychological effects\".* Fifty nine percent of participants indicated they could not recall the process to withdraw from the study with an additional 16 % responding they were unclear. Of those indicating they understood the process for withdrawing, a small number mentioned they could withdraw any time, however the majority of participants responded to this question by explaining they were of aware of the process to contact the site research nurse or the trial co-ordinator to communicate their intention to withdraw. Recall of the potential risks and side effects was poor. Over 41 % could not describe any side effects or risks and a further 29 % were unsure. Twenty eight percent of women listed side effects, with the majority accurately recalling acupuncture side effects listed on the information sheet including slight discomfort, pain from needling, and the less frequently occurring events relation to feeling lighted heads, nausea, and dizziness. Five inaccurately recalled a risk of infection.\n",
      "# Abstract ## Objective To determine abnormal MRI findings in adults hospitalized with acute severe axial LBP. ## Method Sixty patients with back pain were divided into 3 groups consisting of 1) 23 adults with acute axial severe LBP who could not sit up or stand up for several days, but had not experienced previous back-related diseases or trauma (group A), 2) 19 adults who had been involved in a minor traffic accident, and had mild symptoms but not limited mobility (group B), and 3) 18 adults with LBP with radicular pain (group C)., Various MRI findings were assessed among the above 3 groups and compared as follows: disc herniation (protrusion, extrusion), lumbar disc degeneration (LDD), annular tear, high intensity zone (HIZ), and endplate changes. ## Results The MRI findings of A group were as follows: disc herniation (87%), LDD (100%), annular tear (100%), HIZ (61%), and end plate changes (4.4%). The findings of disc herniation, annular tear, HIZ, and LDD were more prevalent in A group than in B group (p<0.01). HIZ findings were more prevalent in A group than in group B or group C (p<0.05). ## Conclusion Patients with acute severe axial LBP were more likely to have disc herniation, LDD, annular tear, HIZ. Among LBP groups, there was a significant association of HIZ on MRI with acute severe axial LBP. # RESULTS The frequencies of the MRI findings were as follows: In patients with acute lower back pain (group A), disc herniation (87%), LDD (100%), annular tear (100%), HIZ (61%), and Modic change (4.4%); in patients with mild lower back pain caused by a simple vehicle accident (control group B), disc herniation (31.6%), LDD (47.4%), annulus tear (26.3%), HIZ (21.1%), and Modic change (10.5%); and in patients with severe radiating lower back pain (control group C), disc herniation (100%), LDD (100%), annulus tear (94.4%), HIZ (16.7%), and Modic changes (27.7%) ([Table 1](#)). In all groups, (80%) of the disc changes were in L4-5 and L5-S1 ([Table 2](#)). There were significant differences in the disc herniation, HDD, annulus tear, and HIZ between the patients with acute severe lower back pain (group A) and the control group B (p<0.05) ([Table 3](#)). The proportion of HIZ incidence was significantly higher in group A than in control group B, and in the patients with severe radiating pain (control group C) (p<0.05) ([Table 3](#)). It was difficult to give clinical meaning to the Modic change, as its frequency was low. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Magnetic resonance images of high intensity zone (HIZ), (A) The sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance image showing a HIZ (arrow) within the posterior annulus at L5-S1, (B) The axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance image shows a HIZ (arrow) within the posterior annulus at L5-S1.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Magnetic resonance images of lumbar disc degeneration (LDD).

      "# Abstract We study whether exposure to poverty can induce affective states that decrease productivity. In a controlled laboratory setting, we find that subjects randomly assigned to a treatment, in which they view a video featuring individuals that live in extreme poverty, exhibit lower subsequent productivity compared to subjects assigned to a control treatment. Questionnaire responses, as well as facial recognition software, provide quantitative measures of the affective state evoked by the two treatments. Subjects exposed to images of poverty experience a more negative affective state than those in the control treatment. Further analysis shows that individuals in a more positive emotional state exhibit less of a treatment effect. Also, those who exhibit greater attentiveness upon viewing the poverty video are less productive. The results are consistent with the notion that exposure to poverty can induce a psychological state in individuals that adversely affects productivity. # Results ## Performance The measure of performance in our experiment is the number of sliders an individual correctly aligns over the course of a ten-period session. On average subjects solved 171.91 sliders with a standard deviation of 46.96 in a session. As illustrated in [Fig 1](#), subjects in the *Poverty* treatment solved 165.2 sliders as compared to 179.3 sliders in the *Neutral* treatment. This difference is borderline significant (t(97,151) = 1.534, p = 0.063). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the hypothesis that the number of sliders completed in the two treatments are drawn from the same distribution (KS-test, p<0.01). Performance in the Neutral treatment is significantly lower than that observed by [[12](#)], where subjects on average solved 222 sliders in 20 minutes. We attribute this difference to the fact that [[12](#)] employ tournament incentives that have been proven to increase effort [[28](#)]. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0170231.g001 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Average performance by treatment.</figcaption> </figure> Furthermore, the treatment effect on performance is significant once other sources of variation are controlled for. We estimate a regression of performance on condition dummies, covariates of wealth, and previous exposure to poverty. The estimates of this linear regression are presented in [Table 1](#). The table shows that the effect of being assigned to *Poverty* is significant once the variables that capture the subject's previous exposure to poverty and wealth are included. Ceteris paribus, a subject assigned to *Poverty* produces on average 1.54 less sliders in each two-minute round as compared to a subject assigned to the *Neutral* condition. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "***p<0.01.:::: These tables show that the *Poverty* treatment yields a higher score on the general dimension scale of negative affects (referred to as NA from here onward), compared to the *Neutral* treatment (p<0.01). This difference stems from the higher score of the Guilt scale, composed by the items *Guilty* and *Ashamed* (p<0.001) and the higher scores of the items *Hostile* (p<0.05), and *Upset* (p<0.001), under *Poverty*. Moreover, the *Poverty* treatment also yields a higher score on the general dimension scale of positive affects (PA from here onward), than under *Neutral* (p = 0.025). This difference between treatments is driven by a higher score on the attentiveness scale, composed of the items *Alert*, *Determined* and *Interested*, in *Poverty* (p<0.05). Note that even though the Joviality scale, composed of *Enthusiastic* and *Excited*, exhibits a lower score under *Poverty* (p = 0.011), the direction of the difference in PA between treatments shows that this difference is not as large as that displayed by attentiveness. *Poverty* induces higher average negative affects compared to the PANAS scores obtained under typical natural conditions. The average score of 21.036 in NA after watching the *Poverty* video is significantly larger than a typical baseline average of NA 14.8 reported by [[13](#)]. However, the *Poverty* treatment does not induce higher average positive affect than 29.7, the score observed by [[13](#)]. Taken together, these results show that the *Poverty* video induces a considerable increase on the score of both positive and negative affects as compared to the *Neutral* video. On the one hand the *Poverty* video evokes higher scores on guilt and hostility. On the other hand, the video increases the score related to attentiveness. ### Physiological Measure of Emotional State The Facereader data indicate that before the videos are played, there are no significant differences in the physiological measures of emotions between treatments. We report no significant difference across treatments in neutrality (p = .9873), sadness (p = 0.1591) happiness (p = .757), anger (p = .7411), scare (p = .4343) or disgust (p = .6738). As a consequence and as can be seen in [Fig 3](#), there is no significant difference in the emotional valence before presentation of the videos (p = 0.782). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0170231.g003 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Initial value and change in valence from before to after the video was shown.</figcaption> </figure> The descriptive statistics of the subject's physiological reaction due to the videos, measured as the difference between the one-minute interval before the beginning of the video and the one-minute interval immediately after it has finished, are presented in [Table 4](#). These statistics, along with [Fig 3](#), show that the *Poverty* video induces a more negative valence (one sided t-test, p = .055). This finding is in agreement with the self-reported data, in that the *Poverty* treatment induces a more negative emotional state than the *Neutral* treatment. This difference is driven by the specific emotions of *Scare* (one sided t-test, p = .039) and *Sadness* (one sided t-test, p = .057). These patterns, coupled with the PANAS results, reveal that the *Poverty* video increases a number of negative emotions such as fear, guilt, sadness, shame and upset. Whether these differences in affects correlate with lower performance is addressed in the next section. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objectives: To respond to the primary safety objective of the Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial 1 (PHPT-1) by studying the evolution of haematological parameters according to zidovudine exposure duration in HIV-1−infected pregnant women. ## Design: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of different durations of zidovudine prophylaxis. ## Setting: 27 hospitals in Thailand. ## Participants: 1,436 HIV-infected pregnant women in PHPT-1. ## Intervention: Zidovudine prophylaxis initiation at 28 or 35 wk gestation. ## Outcome measures: Haemoglobin level, leucocytes, total lymphocyte counts, and absolute neutrophil counts were measured at 26, 32, and 35 wk and at delivery. The evolution of haematological parameters was estimated between 26 and 35 wk (zidovudine/placebo) and between 35 wk and delivery to compare a long versus short zidovudine exposure. For each parameter, linear mixed models were adjusted on baseline sociodemographic variables, HIV clinical stage, CD4 count, and viral load. ## Results: Between 26 and 35 wk, haemoglobin, leucocytes, and absolute neutrophil counts decreased in zidovudine-exposed compared to unexposed women (mean difference [95% CI] −0.4 [−0.5 to −0.3], −423 [−703 to −142], −485 [−757 to −213], respectively). However, between 35 wk and delivery, the haematological parameters increased faster in women exposed to long rather than short durations of zidovudine (0.1 [0.0 to 0.1]; 105 [18 to 191]; 147 [59 to 234], respectively). At delivery, the differences were not statistically significant, except for mean haemoglobin level, which remained slightly lower in the long zidovudine treatment group (difference: 0.2 g/dl). Zidovudine had no negative impact on the absolute lymphocyte counts. ## Conclusion: Zidovudine initiated at 28 wk gestation rather than 35 wk had a transient negative impact on the evolution of haematological parameters, which was largely reversed by delivery despite continuation of zidovudine. This result provides reassurance about the safety of early initiation of zidovudine prophylaxis during pregnancy to maximize prevention of perinatal HIV. # Editorial Commentary **Background:** Pregnant women who are infected with HIV are at high risk of passing on the virus to their unborn baby during pregnancy, labour, and breastfeeding. Around 15%--30% of babies born to HIV-positive women will themselves become infected, if the woman avoids breast-feeding but does not use any other means of preventing the virus from being passed on. However, if a drug, zidovudine (AZT), is given during pregnancy the chance of HIV being passed on to a baby drops from around 23% to around 8%. In some settings it may not be realistic to give the standard course of zidovudine, from 28 weeks of pregnancy, because of its cost and complexity. A number of trials have therefore looked at whether standard-course and short-course zidovudine are equivalent at reducing the risk of passing on HIV from mother to baby. One trial, the Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial-1 (PHPT-1) found that the short treatment course was substantially less effective at preventing HIV from being passed on from mother to baby. Current international guidance therefore recommends starting zidovudine at 28 weeks of pregnancy. However, zidovudine does have several side effects, including anemia; it can also cause a drop in the levels of certain types of white blood cell, and is thought to be toxic to bone marrow. The researchers who had carried out the PHPT-1 trial therefore wanted to do a subsequent analysis of data from that trial to find out whether there were any differences in these safety outcomes between standard and short course zidovudine. **What the trial shows:** In total 1,436 women were recruited into the trial and assigned to receive either zidovudine from 28 weeks of pregnancy until delivery (standard course; 769 women), or from 35 weeks to delivery (short course; 667). Blood tests were performed at 26, 32, and 35 weeks of pregnancy and then at delivery, and the main outcomes assessed in this secondary analysis were the hemoglobin levels (to check for anemia), and levels of white blood cells, including the levels of two particular types (neutrophils and lymphocytes). The researchers found that standard-course zidovudine resulted in a drop at 35 weeks in the levels of hemoglobin and white blood cells, relative to short-course zidovudine. However, by the time of delivery these levels had recovered and no significant differences could be observed between the two arms of the trial. Women receiving standard-course zidovudine were more likely to experience severe anemia, which although a rare event in both arms of the trial, could have serious outcomes. **Strengths and limitations:** The original trial from which these data were collected was a relatively large, randomized study and in which there was a low rate of loss to follow up. Although no formal sample size calculation was performed for the analyses presented here, the study probably had sufficient power to detect small differences in the outcomes assessed. A key limitation of this study is that the analyses presented here are a secondary exploration of data from the PHPT-1 trial and should therefore be seen as hypotheses to test in further studies, rather than as definitive conclusions. **Contribution to the evidence:** The analyses presented here add to the findings of the parent trial, PHPT-1, by providing additional data about the toxicity of zidovudine. Other trials have not clearly established whether there are differences between short- and standard-course zidovudine in terms of their toxicity. The findings support current guidelines recommending standard-course zidovudine therapy for HIV-positive pregnant women. It is also crucial that efforts are made to ensure women worldwide can get access to facilities for monitoring the status of their HIV infection, and then receive highly active antiretroviral therapy when it is needed. # RESULTS ## Participants and Baseline Data The baseline characteristics of 1,436 pregnant HIV-infected women included in the PHPT-1 trial between June 1997 and December 1999 have already been described [[8](#)]. The main characteristics are described in [Table 1](#), and participant flow is described in [Figure 1](#). In total, 667 HIV-1 women were randomized to the short zidovudine regimen and 769 women to the long regimen. ::::table-wrap\n",

Median (IQR) length of gestation was 39.0 (38.0 to 40.0) wk. Median gestational ages at pre-entry and at randomization visit were 25.7 (24.6 to 26.4) wk and 27.9 (27.3 to 28.1) wk, respectively. The median duration of the first period (pre-entry to 35-wk visit) and the second period (35-wk visit to delivery) considered for analysis were 9.0 (8.0 to 9.9) wk and 4.3 (3.9 to 4.8) wk, respectively. The durations of the periods did not differ significantly according to randomization arms. ## Outcomes The observed evolutions of the mean haemoglobin, leucocyte, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count, between 26 wk of gestation and delivery, are presented in [Figure 2](#) by randomization arms. The mean haemoglobin level increased steadily between 26 wk and delivery in women randomized to the short regimen ([Figure 2](#)A). In women randomized to the long regimen, haemoglobin decreased slightly from 26 to 32 wk, and then increased until delivery. The mean haemoglobin levels, similar at pre-entry in both groups, were significantly lower in women randomized to the long regimen at 32 and 35 wk gestation and, to a lesser extent, at delivery. The mean leucocyte ([Figure 2](#)B) and neutrophil ([Figure 2](#)C) counts decreased slightly until 35 wk and then increased sharply until delivery, with a more rapid decrease and subsequent increase in women randomized to the long regimen. The mean counts were significantly lower at 32 and 35 wk gestation in women randomized to the long regimen, but did not differ between the two groups at delivery. The lymphocyte counts ([Figure 2](#)D) remained stable until 35 wk of gestation and then increased until delivery, with no difference between the two groups. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Haematological Parameters between 26 Weeks' Gestation and Delivery in HIV-Infected Women According to Zidovudine Exposure<br /> Measurements occurred at the same visit in the two groups.

There were no differences in the absolute lymphocyte counts ([Table 3](#)). The predicted means are described in [Table 3](#). Other than zidovudine exposure, the factors independently associated with a negative evolution of haematological parameters were low body mass index, multiparity, low CD4 count, an advanced HIV clinical stage, and high baseline viral load (unpublished data). ## Blood Transfusions Overall, eight (0.6%) pregnant women received blood transfusions. All were exposed to zidovudine from 28 wk gestation (8/754 versus 0/656, *p* = 0.01). Among these women, two were transfused because of a haemorrhage (at delivery and at 7 d before delivery). One woman with a thalassemia trait received packed red cell transfusions at 45 and 37 d before delivery. The remaining five women were transfused at 0, 2, 4, 25 and 64 d before delivery because of anaemia, including one woman with a haemoglobin level of 4.6 g/dl who delivered a stillborn.\n",
      "# Abstract Learned irrelevance (LIrr) refers to a reduction in associative learning after pre-exposure of the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus in a non-contingent fashion. This paradigm might serve as a translational model for (pre)attentive information processing deficits in schizophrenia. This is the first study to investigate the event-related potentials (ERPs) of a within-subject LIrr paradigm in humans. Furthermore, the effects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden on LIrr were assessed. As expected, LIrr was found to be intact in young healthy volunteers after placebo. Furthermore, in the placebo condition P3b latency was decreased for target stimuli, which were pre-cued. This suggests that the predictability of the occurrence of these stimuli is mainly reflected by this ERP component. Biperiden had no effect on the behavioural LIrr measures, although prolonged reaction times were evident. Biperiden increased the N1 amplitude of the pre-exposed predictor letters, suggesting an effect of this drug on early perceptual processing. In conclusion, the within-subject paradigm used in the current study in combination with electroencephalography can reveal brain mechanisms involved in LIrr. M1 antagonism did not affect LIrr performance but seemed to influence early information processing. # Results One participant did not meet the requirement of at least 80% target hits and was therefore excluded from behavioural and ERP analysis. Part of the behavioural data was missing for another subject; this person was also not included, leaving a total of 15 participants. ## Behavioural data: LIrr effects [Figure 2](#) shows the effects of the LIrr conditions on RT to the target letters. In the analysis of the RT data, there was a main effect of LIrr condition on RT [*F*(2, 28)=21.73, *p*<0.001]. *Post-hoc* analysis showed that RTs to the target letters were faster for the NPE compared with the RAN (*p*<0.001) and PE condition (*p*<0.001). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Effects of the learned irrelevance (LIrr) conditions and biperiden on reaction time (RT) to the target letters (means+<span class=\"smallcaps\">s.e.m</span>., ** <em>p</em>&lt;0.01; *** <em>p</em>&lt;0.001). In the placebo condition, intact LIrr is present, reflected by larger RTs for pre-exposed (PE)- than for non-pre-exposed (NPE)-cued target letters.

In the placebo analyses of the target letters, there were no relevant task effects on N1 amplitude and latency (*F*'s<1.58, n.s.) or on P3b amplitude (*F*'s<1.17, n.s.).

The analysis of the amplitude of the N1 peak showed that the effect of biperiden varied per level of electrode [treatment×electrode interaction effect: *F*(2, 26)=7.54, *p*<0.01] and per level of LIrr condition [treatment×LIrr condition interaction effect: *F*(2, 26)=3.94, *p*<0.05]. Therefore, we decided to do separate repeated measures ANOVAs per LIrr condition. In the analyses of RAN and NPE predictors, there were no interaction or main effects of biperiden on N1 amplitude (*F*'s<1.98, n.s.). For the PE predictors, the effect of treatment on N1 amplitude varied per electrode [treatment×electrode interaction effect: *F*(2, 26)=7.42, *p*<0.01]; therefore we performed separate repeated measures ANOVAs per electrode. Biperiden was found to increase the N1 amplitude at Fz and FCz (*F*'s>5.77, *p*<0.05). There were no relevant interaction effects or main effects of biperiden on N1 latency (*F*'s<2.40, n.s.), or on P3a amplitude or latency (*F*'s<2.25, n.s.) of the predictor letters. Furthermore, for the targets there were no effects of biperiden on N1 amplitude and latency (*F*'s<3.25, n.s.), or on P3b amplitude and latency (*F*'s<4.18, n.s.). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Effects of biperiden on the N1 component of the pre-exposed predictor letters (Fz electrode channel).

      "# Abstract ## Purpose This randomized controlled, clinical prospective interventional trial was aimed at exploring the effect of patient empowerment on short- and long-term outcomes after major oncologic surgery in elderly cancer patients. ## Methods This trial was performed from February 2011 to January 2014 at two tertiary medical centers in Germany. The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months. ## Results Overall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 ± 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7--14 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions. ## Conclusion Patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative length of stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state, pre-operative functional impairment, severity of surgery, and length of anesthesia. ## Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov. Identifier [NCT01278537](#) # Results ## Patient recruitment The outline of patient recruitment and follow-up is shown in [Fig 1](#). The final sample consisted of 652 patients. Of these, 326 patients were assigned to the intervention-group and 326 patients were assigned to the control-group. After 12 months, questionnaires were sent to the patients. 103 patients (15.8%) had died. We received 450 questionnaires out of 549 (79%). Loss to follow-up was 15.2% (n = 99) after 12 months. Follow-up after 3 months was of no concern for the primary endpoints and is not considered in this analysis. ## Baseline characteristics The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are listed in Tables [1](#) and [2](#). The mean age of all patients was 72 ± 4.9 years. There were more men (68.6%) than women (31.4%). Distribution of tumor site is also shown in [Table 1](#). There were no differences regarding age, gender and tumor distribution between both groups (p = 0.5; p = 0.24 and p = 0.74 respectively). All other demographic and clinical data were comparable in intervention and control group ([Table 1](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

In women, the mean difference from baseline global HRQoL to global HRoL 12 months after surgery was -2.63 ± 27 in the intervention group, and -- 6,16 ± 25 in the control group (p = 0.37). In men, the mean difference score was -0.48 ± 24 in the intervention group compared to -1.62 ± 25 in the control group (p = 0.71). Between the groups, there were no clinical or statistical significant changes. Merely the women in the control group showed a small clinical decline (5--9 points difference) [[16](#)].

      "# Abstract ## Background Plasmalogens (Pls) reportedly decreased in postmortem brain and in the blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently we showed that intraperitoneal administration of Pls improved cognitive function in experimental animals. In the present trial, we tested the efficacy of oral administration of scallop-derived purified Pls with respect to cognitive function and blood Pls changes in patients with mild AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). ## Methods The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 24 weeks. Participants were 328 patients aged 60 to 85 years who had 20 to 27 points in Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese (MMSE-J) score and five or less points in Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Version-Japanese (GDS-S-J). They were randomized to receive either 1 mg/day of Pls purified from scallop or placebo. The patients and study physicians were masked to the assignment. The primary outcome was MMSE-J. The secondary outcomes included Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), GDS-S-J and concentration of phosphatidyl ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsPE) in erythrocyte membrane and plasma. This trial is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network, number UMIN000014945. ## Findings Of 328 patients enrolled, 276 patients completed the trial (140 in the treatment group and 136 in the placebo group). In an intention-to-treat analysis including both mild AD (20 ≤ MMSE-J ≤ 23) and MCI (24 ≤ MMSE-J ≤ 27), no significant difference was shown between the treatment and placebo groups in the primary and secondary outcomes, with no severe adverse events in either group. In mild AD patients, WMS-R improved significantly in the treatment group, and the between group difference was nearly significant (P = 0.067). In a subgroup analysis of mild AD patients, WMS-R significantly improved among females and those aged below 77 years in the treatment group, and the between-group differences were statistically significant in females (P = 0.017) and in those aged below 77 years (P = 0.029). Patients with mild AD showed a significantly greater decrease in plasma PlsPE in the placebo group than in the treatment group. ## Interpretation Oral administration of scallop-derived purified Pls may improve cognitive functions of mild AD. ## Funding The Japanese Plasmalogen Society. # Results ## Study Participants A total of 328 patients were enrolled at 25 hospitals or clinics in Kyushu, Kanto, and Kansai regions in Japan from November 15, 2014 to October 8, 2015. They were randomly assigned to either of the two treatment groups (166 to Pls group and 162 to placebo group). Of the 328 enrolled patients, 285 continued to participate in the study for 12 weeks, and 276 completed the 24 week study period. Those who completed the study included 11 patients (4.0%) who failed to use 80% or more of the provided test substance. [Fig. 1](#) shows the trial profile. No significant difference was noted between the groups with respect to age, MMSE-J, GDS-S-J, WMS-R (0 min), WMS-R (30 min), erythrocyte PlsPE, and plasma PlsPE, at baseline, although the male-to-female ratio was significantly lower in the placebo group ([Table 1](#)). ## Clinical Efficacy ### Primary Analysis In an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups in the primary and secondary outcomes of cognitive function. The MMSE-J score showed a nearly significant improvement in the treatment group while no such improvement was observed in the placebo group, resulting no statistically significant between-group difference. The WMS-R (0 min) and WMS-R (30 min) score each showed a significant improvement in both groups, but there was no statistically significant between-group difference. Erythrocyte PlsPE increased and plasma PlsPE decreased to different degrees after treatment in both Pls and placebo groups. There was no statistically significant between-group difference at any points of time, while the decrease in plasma PlsPE seemed greater in the placebo group ([Table 2](#)). ### Subgroup Analysis We examined the change in cognitive function in mild AD patients and MCI patients separately. No notable change was seen in MMSE-J in either group. WMS-R (0 min) and WMS-R (30 min) improved statistically significantly in the treatment group, and the improvement seemed greater in the Pls treatment group with respect to the 0 min value (P = 0.067) and the 30-min value (P = 0.078) ([Table 3](#)). ### Subgroup Analysis by Gender and Age Furthermore, we analyzed the cognitive function in patients with mild AD patients by gender and age ([Table 4](#)). Mild AD patients were divided into two groups based on the median value, 77 years or younger and 78 years or older. In the patients aged 77 years or younger, WMS-R (30 min) increased statistically significantly in the treatment group, showing a significant between-group difference (P = 0.029). In female patients with mild AD, WMS-R (30 min) improved significantly in the treatment group, with a significant between-group difference (P = 0.017). There was no notable between-group difference in the analysis of MCI patients by gender and age. ### Changes in Blood Plasmalogens The changes in blood PlsPE levels among mild AD patients were examined ([Table 5](#)). Plasma PlsPE decreased in the placebo group, showing a significant between-group difference (P = 0.016). There was a statistically significant elevation of erythrocyte PlsPE at week 16 in the treatment group and at week 24 in placebo. However, the changes were not significantly different between the two groups. ## Clinical Safety [Table 6](#) summarizes adverse events. There was no notable difference in the occurrence of adverse events between the two groups. <figure> Fig. 1 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Trial profile.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objectives Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of peer-led self-management education in improving glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in a low-income country (Mali). ## Methods We conducted an open-label randomised controlled trial. A total of 151 adults (76% women, mean age 52.5) with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c≥8%), treated in the diabetes consultation units of two secondary health centres in Bamako, were allocated to peer-led structured patient education (n = 76) or conventional care alone (n = 75). The intervention group received 1 year of culturally tailored structured patient education (3 courses of 4 sessions) delivered in the community by five trained peer educators. Both groups underwent conventional diabetes monitoring and follow-up. Primary outcome was the mean absolute change in HbA1c from baseline to 12 months. ## Results 177 education sessions were delivered to the intervention group. Patient attrition was 8%. From baseline to 12 months, the decrease in HbA1c levels was 1.05% (SD = 2.0; CI95%: 1.54;-0.56) in the intervention group compared with 0.15% (SD = 1.7; CI95%: -0.56; 0.26) in the control group, p = 0.006. Mean BMI change was -1.65 kg/m2 (SD = 2.5; CI95%: -2.25; -1.06) in the intervention group and +0.05 kg/m2 (SD = 3.2; CI95%: -0.71; 0.81) in the control group, p = 0.0005. Mean waist circumference decreased by 3.34 cm (SD = 9.3; CI95%: -5.56;-1.13) in the intervention group and increased by 2.65 cm (SD = 10.3; CI95%: 0.20; 5.09) in the control group, p = 0.0003. ## Conclusions Peer-led structured patient education delivered over 1 year to patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in Mali yielded substantial improvements in glycaemic control and anthropometric parameters. This is of importance for the scaling up of efficient interventions in low-resource settings in the future. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01485913](#) # Results From July, 21st to September, 30^th^, 2011, we included 151 patients in the study: 76 in the intervention group and 75 in the control group ([Fig 1](#)). Study participants were mostly female (n = 115, 76.2%) and the majority were overweight (BMI> = 25: n = 110, 72.9%). A third of the sample presented high blood pressure (n = 51, 33.8%). The mean HbA1c level was 10.6% (standard deviation (sd = 1.8) and 10.8% (sd = 1.9) in the intervention arm and the control arm, respectively. At baseline, patients' characteristics in the 2 groups were similar ([Table 1](#)). Educational courses took place between October and December 2011, April and July 2012, August-December 2012. The follow-up of participants from both groups took place between 1^st^ October 2011 and 20 ^th^ February 2013. The reasons for this slight delay in scheduled courses and follow-ups were that due to political events in Mali during 2012 we had to post pone the second and third education session courses in the intervention arm, and the corresponding follow-ups (February 2012, July 2012, January 2013). The patterns of withdrawal are documented in [Fig 1](#). Overall, the 5 PEs facilitated 177 educational sessions with a mean of 6.4 patients per group session in the intervention group. Among intervention patients, 70 attended the 3 courses. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0191262.g001 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow chart of participants.<br /> ST2EP trial.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

Similarly, the evolution of BMI and WC was more favourable in the intervention group than in the control group (p = 0.001 for BMI and WC; [Fig 3](#)). Patients' knowledge scores improved slightly, mostly due to their increased knowledge of symptoms, treatment and hypoglycaemia management ([Table 4](#)). No positive change in the diet diversity score as a crude index of diet quality was recorded in intervention patients. The number of meals remained the same. However, qualitative changes in the diet were noted from dietary recalls at baseline and at the end of follow-up in the various meals and snacks eaten during the day: meat and fish, as well as peanut and onion sauce, consumption was more abundant at baseline, the number of patients who mentioned having a morning snack decreased by more than half at follow-up, <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0191262.g002 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Evolution of HbA1c levels between baseline and 12 months–levels in % and 95% confidence interval.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0191262.g003 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Evolution of body mass index, waist circumference and blood pressure between baseline and 12 months– 95% confidence interval.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Working memory (WM) often is impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such impairment may underlie core deficits in cognition and social functioning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance WM in both healthy adults and clinical populations, but its efficacy in ASD is unknown. We predicted that bifrontal tDCS would improve WM performances of adults with high-functioning autism during active stimulation compared to sham stimulation and that such enhancement would generalize to an untrained task. ## Methods Twelve adults with high-functioning ASD engaged in a battery of WM tasks that included backward spatial span, backward digit span, spatial *n*-back and letter *n*-back. While engaged, 40 min of 1.5 mA bifrontal stimulation was applied over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Using a single-blind crossover design, each participant received left anodal/right cathodal stimulation, right anodal/left cathodal stimulation, or sham stimulation, in randomized counterbalanced order on three separate days. Following tDCS, participants again engaged in letter and spatial *n*-back tasks before taking the Brief Test of Attention (BTA). We used repeated-measures ANOVA to compare overall performance on the WM battery as measured by a composite of *z*-scores for all five measures. Post hoc ANOVAs, *t* tests, Friedman's tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to measure the online and offline effects of tDCS and to assess performances on individual measures. ## Results Compared to sham stimulation, both left DLPFC anodal stimulation (*t*~11~ = 5.4, *p* = 0.0002) and right DLPFC anodal stimulation (*t*~11~ = 3.57, *p* = 0.004) improved overall WM performance. Left anodal stimulation (*t*~11~ = 3.9, *p* = 0.003) and right anodal stimulation (*t*~11~ = 2.7, *p* = 0.019) enhanced performances during stimulation. Enhancement transferred to an untrained task 50 min after right anodal stimulation *(z*~11~ = 2.263, *p* = 0.024). The tasks that showed the largest effects of active stimulation were spatial span backward (*z*~11~ = 2.39, *p* = 0.017) and BTA (*z*~11~ = 2.263, *p* = 0.024). ## Conclusions In adults with high-functioning ASD, active bifrontal tDCS given during WM tasks appears to improve performance. TDCS benefits also transferred to an untrained task completed shortly after stimulation. These results suggest that tDCS can improve WM task performance and could reduce some core deficits of autism. ## Trial registration [NCT01602263](#) # Results ## Primary outcome: overall WM performance As shown in the final row of Table [1](#), the composite *z*-scores (full battery) were −0.25 (SD 0.71) for sham stimulation, 0.13 (SD 0.82) for left anodal stimulation, and 0.11 (SD 0.81) for right anodal stimulation, which repeated measures ANOVA showed to be significantly different (*F*~2,22~ = 12.85, *p* = 0.0002). Post hoc, paired-sample *t* tests revealed that performances associated with both left anodal active stimulation (*t*~11~ = 5.4, *p* = 0.0002) and right anodal active stimulation (*t*~11~ = 3.57, *p* = 0.004) were better than performances associated with sham tDCS. For composite *z*-scores (full battery), Cohen's *d*~*s*~ effect sizes were 0.50 for left anodal stimulation and 0.47 for right anodal stimulation. There was no difference in overall WM performance between the two active stimulation conditions (*t*~11~ = 0.26, *p* = 0.796). To assess the role of session order on full-battery composite *z*-scores, we compared them across sessions. We found composite *z*-scores (full battery) of −0.03 (SD 0.81) for session 1, −0.06 (SD 0.75) for session 2, and 0.09 (SD 0.83) for session 3. Repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant practice effects across sessions (F~2,22~ = 0.88, *p* = 0.428). ::::table-wrap\n",

Post hoc, paired-sample *t* tests revealed that performances as measured by composite *z*-scores of the four working memory tests given during both left anodal active stimulation (*t*~11~ = 3.9, *p* = 0.003, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.52) and right anodal active stimulation (*t*~11~ = 2.7, *p* = 0.019, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.46) were better than performances during sham stimulation. Performances during the two active stimulation conditions (*t*~11~ = 0.60, *p* = 0.563) were not significantly different. The composite *z*-scores (offline) were −0.18 (SD 0.92) for sham stimulation, 0.09 (SD 0.77) for left anodal stimulation, and 0.09 (SD 0.93) for right anodal stimulation, which Friedman's test showed to be significantly different (χ^2^ = 7.17, *p* = 0.028). Follow-up Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed that after left anodal stimulation performances were not significantly better compared to after sham stimulation (*z* = 1.88, *p* = 0.06, *r* = 0.27, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.33), but performances after right anodal stimulation were significantly better than after sham stimulation (*z* = 2.35, *p* = 0.019, *r* = 0.34, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.30). Although performances after right anodal stimulation were marginally better than after left anodal stimulation, the difference was not significant (*z* = 1.49, *p* = 0.136). ## Secondary outcomes: individual WM measures Mean (SD) scores for each of the five measures that made up our overall WM composite are presented in Table [1](#). As shown in the first row, the participants' longest backward spatial span was 4.8 (SD 0.9) blocks during sham stimulation compared to 6.2 (SD 1.8) blocks during left anodal stimulation and 6.0 (SD 0.9) blocks during right anodal stimulation. Friedman's test showed that these differed significantly (χ^2^ = 9.24, *p* = 0.010). Post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicate that left anodal stimulation (*z*~11~ = 2.21, *p* = 0.027, *r* = 0.32) and right anodal stimulation (*z*~11~ = 2.39, *p* = 0.017, *r* = 0.34) were both associated with longer maximum spans than sham stimulation. Cohen's *d*~*s*~ effect sizes were 1.03 for left anodal stimulation and 1.39 for right anodal stimulation. Performances during the two active stimulation conditions were not different (*z*~11~ = 0.30, *p* = 0.762). We examined the role of practice effects on all tests for which significant differences were found between stimulation conditions. Participants' longest spatial span was 5.6 blocks (SD 1.2) during session 1, 5.5 blocks (SD 1.1) during session 2, and 5.9 blocks (SD 1.8) during session 3. Friedman tests showed no significant practice effects across sessions (χ^2^ = 0.05, *p* = 0.973). Also as shown in Table [1](#), participants' longest backward digit span averaged 5.3 (SD 1.5) digits during sham compared to 5.5 (SD 1.6) digits during left anodal and 5.4 (SD 2.0) during right anodal stimulation. Friedman's test showed no significant differences in longest digit span between conditions (χ^2^ = 0.41, *p* = 0.814). Spatial *n*-back accuracy was calculated as (hits + correct negatives)/(total items). Online *n*-back accuracy was 62.4% (SD 25.0%) during sham stimulation, 68.6% (SD 22.1%) during left anodal stimulation, and 66.7% (SD 23.2%) during right anodal stimulation. Friedman's test showed no significant differences between conditions (χ^2^ = 3.17, *p* = 0.205). Offline spatial *n*-back accuracy was 63.9% (SD 24.9%) after sham stimulation, 70.6% (SD 20.9%) after left anodal stimulation, and 67.7% (SD 24.2%) after right anodal stimulation, which were not significantly different (χ^2^ = 0.55, *p* = 0.758). Letter *n*-back accuracy was calculated as (hits + correct negatives)/(total items). Online *n*-back accuracy was 69.6% (SD 30.2%) during sham stimulation, 76.2% (SD 22.5%) during left anodal stimulation, and 76.3% (SD 26.8%) during right anodal stimulation. These were not significantly different (χ^2^ = 0.5, *p* = 0.779). Offline letter *n*-back accuracy was 72.3% (SD 29.8%) after sham stimulation, 78.5% (SD 22.5%) after left anodal stimulation, and 76.5% (SD 25.9%) after right anodal stimulation. These also were not significantly different (χ^2^ = 0.17, *p* = 0.920). Brief Test of Attention (BTA) raw scores averaged 6.8 (SD 2.5) after sham stimulation compared to 7.4 (SD 2.2) after left anodal and 7.9 (SD 2.5) after right anodal stimulation. We found the predicted main effect of condition on BTA performance with Freidman's test (χ^2^ = 7.09, *p* = 0.029). Follow-up Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed that BTA performance after left anodal stimulation was not significantly different from BTA performance after sham stimulation (*z*~11~ = 1.63, *p* = 0.102, *r* = 0.24, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.27), but BTA performance after right anodal stimulation was better than after sham (*z*~11~ = 2.26, *p* = 0.024, *r* = 0.33, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.46). Additionally, BTA performance was better after right than left anodal stimulation (*z*~11~ = 2.45, *p* = 0.014, *r* = 0.35, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.22). There was no effect of practice on BTA performance from session 1 to session 3 (*z*~11~ = −1.12, *p* = 0.265). The results of our secondary analyses are depicted in Fig. [3a--c](#). ## Blinding We hypothesized that participants would tolerate tDCS and remain blind to condition. All participants completed the three sessions with no adverse events. After each session, all 12 participants were asked to indicate (yes/no) whether they thought they had received real stimulation. Eleven participants endorsed left anodal stimulation as real, nine endorsed right anodal stimulation as real, and 10 endorsed sham as real. McNemar's test of related samples showed no differences in endorsement rates between sham and both left (*p* > 0.99) and right (*p* > 0.99) active anodal stimulation.\n",
      "# Abstract ## Objective: To compare the safety and effectiveness of flexible ureteroscopy (F-URS) with transperitoneal laparoscopic ureterolithotomy (TPLU) in cases of obstructive pyelonephritis secondary to large proximal ureteral stones. ## Methods: A series of 42 patients presenting with obstructive pyelonephritis due to proximal ureteral stones larger than 1.5 cm were included from April 2006 to February 2015 in this comparative study. After drainage of pyonephrosis and resolution of sepsis, 22 patients treated with TPLU (Group I), and 20 patients were treated with F-URS (Group II). Preoperative patient and stone characteristics, procedure-related parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed for each group. ## Results: It was seen that both methods were effective in the treatment of large proximal ureteral stones. However TPLU provided a higher stone- free rate (100% vs 80%. p=0.043) and lower retreatment rate. There was no difference between the groups for the operative time and complication rate. On the other hand, patients treated with F-URS had less postoperative pain (p=0.008), a shorter hospital stay (p<0.001) and a faster return to daily activities (p<0.001). ## Conclusions: The results of our study show that both F-URS and TPLU are safe and effective surgical procedures for treatment of large proximal ureteral stones after controlling obstructive pyelonephritis. However, TPLU has a higher stone-free rate with comparable operating time and complication rate as compared to F-URS. On the other hand F-URS has the advantages of less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and faster return to daily activities. # RESULTS ## Patient and Stone Characteristics The present study included 26 (61.9%) men and 16 (38.1%) women. Group I consisted of 22, and group II consisted of 20 patients. There was no significant difference between the groups of patients for age, gender, stone size, stone density and stone site; however, there was a significant difference for body mass index (BMI). The mean BMI were 25.9±2.3 kg/m ^2^ and 27.8±1.3 kg/m ^2^ in group I and II, respectively (p=0.002).

      "# Abstract ## Background Patient education has proved beneficial in several but not all chronic disease. Inconsistent findings may rely on varying educational effects of various programs and differential effects on subgroups of patients. Patients' increase in disease knowledge may serve as a feedback to the educator on how well the education program works -- but may not be associated to relevant clinical outcomes like quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to investigate the effects of a group based education program for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) on disease knowledge and the association between knowledge and QoL. ## Methods Patients with GERD were randomly allocated to education (102 patients) or control (109 patients). The education program was designed as a structured dialogue conveying information about pathophysiology, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of GERD, patients' rights and use of healthcare. Outcomes were a 24 item knowledge test on GERD (score 0 -- 24) 2 and 12 months after the educational program and disease specific and general QoL (Digestive symptoms and disease impact, DSIQ, and General Health Questionnaire, GHQ). ## Results Patients allocated to education achieved higher knowledge test scores than controls at 2 months (17.0 vs. 13.1, p < 0.001) and at 12 months (17.1 vs. 14.0, p < 0.001) follow-up. Knowledge test score was positively associated with having completed advanced school and inversely related to psychiatric illness and poor QoL as perceived by the patients at the time of inclusion. Overall, changes in knowledge test score were not associated with change in QoL. ## Conclusion A group based education program for patients with GERD designed as a structured dialogue increased patients' disease knowledge, which was retained after 1 year. Changes in GERD-knowledge were not associated with change in QoL. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT0061850 # Results ## Patients Of 211 patients who were included, 102 were randomly allocated to GERD education and 109 to control. The GERD -education and control groups did not differ statistically with regards to socio-demographic variables; disease history or disease characteristics (Table [1](#) ). Of the patients who were allocated to GERD -education, 58 (56.9%) attended three lessons, 27 (26.5%) two and 5 (4.9%) one lesson. Twelve patients (11.8%) did not meet at all, of whom 5 were not able due to work or private obligations, 4 gave no reasons, 2 on grounds of other diseases and 1 did not wish to participate. At two months follow-up 90 patients (88%) in the GERD -education group and 100 patients (92%) in the control group responded completely. At 12 months 85 (83%) and 88 patients (81%) gave complete responses respectively. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract Physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive functions. However, it is still unknown which type of exercise affects cognition. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a demanding balance training program improves memory and spatial cognition. Forty healthy participants aged 19--65 years were randomly assigned to either a balance or relaxation training intervention. Each group exercised twice a week for a total of 12 weeks. Pre- and posttests assessed balance performance, cardiorespiratory fitness, memory, spatial cognition, and executive functions. Only the balance group significantly increased in balance performance from pre- to posttest, while cardiorespiratory fitness remained unchanged in both groups. Moreover, the balance group significantly improved in memory and spatial cognition. Effects on executive functions were not observed. These results suggest that balance training is capable of improving particularly memory and spatial cognition. Therefore, an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition. It might be speculated that stimulating the vestibular system during balance training induces changes of the hippocampus and parietal cortex possibly via direct pathways between the vestibular system and these brain regions. # Results Participants of the balance and the relaxation group did not differ with respect to age, gender, vocabulary score, cardiorespiratory fitness, self-reported physical activity, and psychopathological symptoms (see Table [1](#)). Moreover, the groups did not differ significantly with respect to the physical and cognitive variables at pretest (all p > 0.250, see Table [2](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

After training, the adjusted mean of the balance group was higher than the mean of the relaxation group (group difference = 1.60, 95% CI = [0.05, 3.05], *d* = 0.47, see Fig. [3](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Violin plots of the performance of the balance group (dark gray) and the relaxation group (light gray) for the memory test, spatial score and executive functions (Stroop test), showing the distribution and density of the data. Horizontal bars indicate the group mean. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.</figcaption> </figure> The analysis of spatial score yielded a significant effect of group, *F*(1, 36) = 5.28, *p* = 0.027. After training, the adjusted spatial score was higher in the balance than in the relaxation training group (group difference = 0.31, 95% CI = [0.04, 0.58], *d* = 0.51, see Fig. [3](#)). To test whether the Stroop effect could reliably be elicited to measure executive functions in the present study, reaction times of congruent trials were compared to reaction times of incongruent trials, collapsed across groups and time. As expected, participants reacted faster in the congruent condition (M = 664.774 ms, SD = 177.583 ms) compared to the incongruent condition (M = 885.564, SD = 239.654 ms), *t*(134) = 6.37, *p* < 0.001. To analyze training effects on executive functions, an interference score was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction time of the incongruent condition from the mean reaction time of the congruent condition for each participant. There was no significant effect of group on the Stroop interference score at posttest, *F*(1, 33) = 0.01, *p* = 0.911, group difference = −3.47, 95% CI = [−66.39, 59.44], *d* = −0.03 (see Fig. [3](#)). ## Self-reported physical activity and psychopathological symptoms On average, participants increased their total weekly physical activity from M = 7.62 (SD = 5.58) hours at pretest to M = 10.12 (SD = 6.68) hours at posttest. Moreover, they expended more energy per week (MET score) at posttest (M = 34.59, SD = 24.07) than at pretest (M = 28.45, SD = 19.16). The average increase in self-reported physical activity reflects the participation in the supervised training, i.e. two hours/week with low to moderate intensity. Importantly, for the self-reported physical activity, the analysis yielded no significant effect of groups after training: Neither for hours/week: *F*(1, 36) = 0.42, *p* = 0.521, group difference = −1.12, 95% CI = [−4.62, 2.39], *d* = −0.17 nor for MET: *F*(1, 36) = 0.04, *p* = 0.84, group difference = 1.37, 95% CI = [−12.03, 14.78], *d* = 0.05, respectively (see Table [2](#)). The analysis of the psychopathological symptoms assessed with the SCL-90 displayed no significant effect of group, *F*(1, 37) = 0.42, *p* < 0.521, group difference = 0.035, 95% CI = [−0.07, 0.14], *d* = 0.15, see Table [2](#)). Age did not correlate with changes from pre- to posttest in any of the physical and cognitive variables (all r < 0.12, p > 0.250), indicating that younger and older participants did not differ in their benefits after training.\n",
      "# Abstract *Purpose*. This is a secondary analysis of previously published data to investigate the effects of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) on strength of various muscle groups in critically ill patients. *Methods*. One hundred forty-two consecutive patients, with APACHE II score ≥ 13, were randomly assigned to the EMS or the control group. EMS sessions were applied daily on vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and peroneus longus of both lower extremities. Various muscle groups were evaluated with the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength. Handgrip strength assessment was also employed. *Results*. Twenty four patients in the EMS group and 28 patients in the control group were finally evaluated. EMS patients achieved higher MRC scores than controls (*P* ≤ 0.05) in wrist flexion, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion. Collectively, the EMS group performed higher (*P* < 0.01) in the legs and overall. Handgrip strength correlated (*P* ≤ 0.01) with the upper and lower extremities' muscle strength and the overall MRC scores. *Conclusions*. EMS has beneficial effects on the strength of critically ill patients mainly affecting muscle groups stimulated, while it may also affect muscle groups not involved presenting itself as a potential effective means of muscle strength preservation and early mobilization in this patient population. # 3. Results Patient recruitment flow chart, as previously reported [[17](#)], is presented in [Figure 1](#). Fifty two patients were finally evaluated, 24 in the EMS group and 28 patients in the control group. Baseline characteristics of all patients in the EMS and control groups have been previously reported [[17](#)]. Baseline characteristics of patients finally evaluated in both groups are presented in [Table 1](#). The MRC scores of all the movements of the upper and lower extremities assessed are presented in [Table 2](#). Patients of the EMS group performed statistically higher MRC scores than controls in wrist flexion, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion of both sides. No statistical differences were found between the two groups in all other movements. No significant between-group differences were observed for the MRC score of the left and the right arm either, while the MRC scores of the left and right legs were significantly higher in the EMS group. Similar between-group results were found for the total MRC score of the arms (EMS: 28 (26--30); control: 26 (22--30), *P* = 0.16) and the legs (EMS: 29 (26--30); control: 25 (20--28), *P* = 0.01). The overall MRC score was significantly higher in patients assigned to the EMS group in comparison to the control group (58 (51--60) versus 52 (40--58), *P* = 0.04) ([Figure 2](#)). In concern to the baseline characteristics of the subgroup in which handgrip dynamometry was applied (*n* = 21), no difference was found between the control (*n* = 9) and the EMS group (*n* = 12) in gender (males/females, 6/3 versus 10/2, *P* = 0.61), age (65 ± 22 versus 61 ± 14 years, *P* = 0.25), or APACHE II score (19 ± 4 versus 17 ± 4, *P* = 0.46). No difference was observed between the EMS and the control group in handgrip strength either in absolute (21.4 ± 10.8 versus 14.8 ± 10.7 kg, resp., *P* = 0.18) or relative (60.2 ± 27.3% predicted versus 49.1 ± 28.5% predicted, resp., *P* = 0.38) values. A significant difference was found in handgrip strength between patients diagnosed with ICU-AW in comparison to those without an ICU-AW diagnosis (6.6 ± 4.4 versus 23.4 ± 8.9 kg, *P* < 0.01), even when the comparison was adjusted for gender and age (*P* < 0.01). This was also the case when handgrip performance was expressed in relative values (29.0 ± 22.4% predicted versus 66.0 ± 22.2% predicted, *P* < 0.01). In concern to between-sides comparison, patients tended to perform better with the dominant rather than the non-dominant hand (16.2 ± 11.1 versus 14.2 ± 9.9 kg, resp., *P* = 0.09). All patients assessed were right handed, therefore the results were similar for comparison between right and left sides. Three patients performed better with the left hand, and in another 3 patients, there was no difference between hands. The 95% limits of agreement were also calculated and found to range from −7.1 to 10.3 kg. In relation to between-trial comparisons, no difference was observed over the 5 trials performed (1st: 16.1 ± 10.5 kg, 2nd: 16.8 ± 10.8 kg, 3rd: 16.9 ± 11.5 kg, 4th: 16.6 ± 11.0, and 5th: 17.1 ± 11.5 kg, *P* = 0.44). Finally, handgrip strength in absolute values correlated (*P* < 0.01) with the MRC score of upper extremities (*r* = 0.78), lower extremities (*r* = 0.73), and the overall (*r* = 0.79) MRC scores ([Figure 3](#)). The respective correlation coefficients (*P* ≤ 0.01) for handgrip strength in relative values (% predicted) were 0.58, 0.53, and 0.55. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow chart diagram of the patients admitted to the ICU during the 30-month study period.

      "# Abstract ## Background: Cognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), with cognitive processing speed being the most frequently affected domain. ## Objective: Examine the effects of daclizumab beta versus intramuscular (IM) interferon (IFN) beta-1a on cognitive processing speed as assessed by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). ## Methods: In DECIDE, patients with relapsing--remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) (age: 18--55 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 0--5.0) were randomized to daclizumab beta ( *n* = 919) or IM IFN beta-1a ( *n* = 922) for 96--144 weeks. SDMT was administered at baseline and at 24-week intervals. ## Results: At week 96, significantly greater mean improvement from baseline in SDMT was observed with daclizumab beta versus IM IFN beta-1a ( *p* = 0.0274). Significantly more patients treated with daclizumab beta showed clinically meaningful improvement in SDMT (increase from baseline of ⩾3 points ( *p* = 0.0153) or ⩾4 points ( *p* = 0.0366)), and significantly fewer patients showed clinically meaningful worsening (decrease from baseline of ⩾3 points ( *p* = 0.0103)). Odds representing risk of worsening versus stability or improvement on SDMT were significantly smaller for daclizumab beta ( *p* = 0.0088 (3-point threshold); *p* = 0.0267 (4-point threshold)). In patients completing 144 weeks of treatment, the effects of daclizumab beta were generally sustained. ## Conclusion: These results provide evidence for a benefit of daclizumab beta versus IM IFN beta-1a on cognitive processing speed in RRMS. ## Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01064401 (Efficacy and Safety of BIIB019 (Daclizumab High Yield Process) Versus Interferon β 1a in Participants With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DECIDE)): [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01064401](#) . # Results ## Descriptive data A total of 1841 patients were randomized (daclizumab beta, *n* = 919; IM IFN beta-1a, *n* = 922). All were included in the ITT population. Demographic and baseline MS disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups, as reported previously. ^[18](#)^At baseline, in the daclizumab beta and IM IFN beta-1a groups, mean (SD) SDMT score was 48.5 (15.9) and 47.7 (16.1), respectively, and median (range) SDMT score was 49 (0--110) and 49 (3--110), respectively. ## Group effects on SDMT Based on the linear mixed model analysis approach, there was a significant group × time interaction ( *p* = 0.0004). Significantly greater mean improvement from baseline in SDMT scores was observed with daclizumab beta compared with IM IFN beta-1a at week 96 (mean (SD) change from baseline: 4.1 (12.4) vs 2.9 (12.7); *p* = 0.0274), as reported previously ( [Figure 1](#) ). ^[18](#)^This effect was sustained at week 144 (6.3 (12.6) vs 3.1 (13.2); *p* = 0.0024) in a limited number of patients completing 144 weeks of treatment with available SDMT scores (daclizumab beta, *n* = 287; IM IFN beta-1a, *n* = 277). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Mean change from baseline in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score at weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, and 144.

      "# Abstract ## OBJECTIVE After intensive insulin treatment, many obese African American patients with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hyperglycemia are able to achieve near-normoglycemia remission. The optimal treatment to prevent hyperglycemic relapses after remission is not known. ## RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This prospective, 4-year, placebo-controlled study randomly assigned 48 African American subjects with DKA and severe hyperglycemia to metformin 1,000 mg daily (*n* = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg daily (*n* = 16), or placebo (*n* = 15) after normoglycemia remission. Hyperglycemic relapse was defined as fasting glucose >130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and HbA~1c~ >7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at randomization and at 3 months and then every 6 months for a median of 331 days. Oral minimal model and incremental area under the curve for insulin (AUCi) were used to calculate insulin sensitivity (Si) and β-cell function, respectively. Disposition index (DI) was calculated as a product of Si and incremental AUCi. ## RESULTS Relapse-free survival was higher in sitagliptin and metformin (*P* = 0.015) compared with placebo, and mean time to relapse was significantly prolonged in the metformin and sitagliptin groups compared with the placebo group (480 vs. 305 days, *P* = 0.004). The probability of relapse was significantly lower for metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10--0.81]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10--0.98]) than for placebo. Subjects who remained in remission had a higher DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) than those with hyperglycemia relapse without significant changes in Si. ## CONCLUSIONS This study shows that near-normoglycemia remission was similarly prolonged by treatment with sitagliptin and metformin. The prolongation of remission was due to improvement in β-cell function. # Results Forty-eight African American subjects with DKA (*n* = 22) and severe hyperglycemia (*n* = 26) were included in the study. Seventeen subjects were randomly assigned to metformin 1,000 mg daily, 16 to sitagliptin 100 mg daily, and 15 to placebo. Four subjects in the metformin group, 6 in the sitagliptin group, and 1 in the placebo group were lost to follow-up. One subject in the sitagliptin group and one subject in the placebo group withdrew from the study. The overall median follow-up after insulin discontinuation was 331 days (interquartile range 102, 612 days) with no differences between randomized groups ([Table 1](#)). The subjects lost to follow-up or who withdrew from the study were in near-normoglycemia remission during their last documented study visit. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics at presentation between subjects who withdrew and those who stayed in the study, except for HbA~1c~. HbA~1c~ was lower at presentation of DKA/hyperglycemia in subjects who withdrew compared with those who stayed (12.0 ± 2.3% [107 ± 25 mmol/mol] vs. 13.5 ± 2.0% [124 ± 22 mmol/mol], *P* = 0.03) but was similar at randomization. ::::table-wrap\n",

The 2-year failure rate was higher in the placebo than in the sitagliptin (77% vs. 44%, *P* = 0.113) or metformin (77% vs. 34%, *P* = 0.013) groups. Compared with placebo, patients randomized to metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10--0.814]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10--0.98]) were ∼70% less likely to have a hyperglycemia relapse. However, there was no difference in hyperglycemia relapse-free survival between metformin and sitagliptin (*P* = 0.75) ([Fig. 1](#)). The restricted mean time to hyperglycemia relapse in the combined metformin and sitagliptin groups was significantly higher than placebo (480 vs. 305 days, *P* = 0.004). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Cox proportional hazards of failure-free survival among metformin, sitagliptin, and placebo in obese African American patients presenting with DKA and severe hyperglycemia. A significant difference was found among the placebo, metformin, and sitagliptin groups (<em>P</em> = 0.015), but no significant difference was found between the sitagliptin and metformin groups (<em>P</em> = 0.75).</figcaption> </figure> We also assessed whether being on medication decreased the severity of hyperglycemia relapse. Because only a small number of subjects experienced relapse in the medication groups (metformin [*n* = 5], sitagliptin [*n* = 4]) compared with placebo (*n* = 11), we combined the metformin and sitagliptin groups. There were no significant differences in HbA~1c~ (8.0 ± 0.8% [64 ± 9 mmol/mol] vs. 8.2 ± 1.5% [66 ± 16 mmol/mol], *P* = 0.79) or blood glucose (152 ± 18 mg/dL [8.4 ± 1 mmol/L] vs. 160 ± 68 mg/dL [8.9 ± 3.8 mmol/L], *P* = 0.65) levels at the time of hyperglycemia relapse between the placebo group and the combined metformin and sitagliptin group. In the placebo group, 3 of the 11 subjects who experienced hyperglycemia relapse presented to the emergency department with a glucose level >400 mg/dL (22.2 mmol/mol) or DKA. None of the patients in the metformin and sitagliptin group had a hyperglycemia relapse necessitating a visit to the emergency department or admission to the hospital. The difference in hyperglycemia relapse was explained by improvements in β-cell function. Over the course of the study, DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) were significantly higher in subjects who remained in near-normoglycemia remission compared with those who had a hyperglycemia relapse without any differences in Si (*P* = 0.75). There was a significant interaction between remission status and study visit for both Si (*P* = 0.01) and DI (*P* = 0.02), suggesting a different pattern of change in Si and DI over time between subjects with near-normoglycemia remission and hyperglycemia relapse. The difference in DI and incremental AUCi was not present at randomization in the subjects who stayed in near-normoglycemia remission compared with those who experienced a hyperglycemia relapse ([Fig. 2*A* and *B*](#)). At the last documented follow-up, there were no differences in Si ([Fig. 2*C*](#)); however, DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) were significantly higher in subjects who stayed in near-normoglycemia remission than in those who had a hyperglycemia relapse at the end of the study ([Fig. 2*A* and *B*](#)). Comparison across treatment groups showed no differences at randomization, over the course of the study, or at the last follow-up for DI, incremental AUCi, or Si (data not shown). Similarly, a comparison of subjects with an initial presentation of DKA and severe hyperglycemia showed no differences in Si, incremental AUCi, or DI at randomization, over the course of the study, or at the last follow-up (data not shown). Although there were no significant changes in weight, we performed analyses adjusting for changes in weight throughout the course of the study. No differences were found in Si, incremental AUCi, or DI compared with unadjusted analyses. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>DI, incremental AUCi, and Si at randomization and last follow-up.

Deliberate restriction of food intake (dieting) produces short-term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long-term weight management. Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating (ie, eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals) and the development of greater psychological flexibility (ie, the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT]).ObjectivesThis pilot study investigated the usage, acceptability, and feasibility of “Mind, Body, Food,” a Web-based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills.MethodsParticipants were 40 overweight women (mean age 44.8 [standard deviation, SD, 3.06] years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32.9 [SD 6.01] kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean Intuitive Eating Scale [IES-1] total score 53.4 [SD 7.46], classified as below average) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin, New Zealand. Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics. Use of an online self-monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database. Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention. BMI, intuitive eating, binge eating, psychological flexibility, and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention.ResultsOf the 40 women enrolled in the study, 12 (30%) completed all 12 modules (median 7.5 [interquartile range, IQR, 2-12] modules) and 4 (10%) used the self-monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period (median 3 [IQR 1-9] weeks). Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments, most women rated “Mind, Body, Food” as useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%) and liked the intervention (22/25, 88%). From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score <em>P</em>&lt;.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: <em>P</em> ≤.01), psychological flexibility (<em>P</em>=.01), and general mental health (<em>P</em>&lt;.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (<em>P</em>=.01). At the 3-month follow-up, IES-2 improvements were maintained, and there were further improvements in binge eating (<em>P</em>&lt;.001) and general mental health (<em>P</em>=.03), and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility (<em>P</em>=.06). There were no significant within-group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow-up (<em>P</em>=.46 and <em>P</em>=.93, respectively).ConclusionsThe “Mind, Body, Food” prototype Web-based intervention is appealing to middle-aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills, reduce binge eating, and maintain weight over 3 months. Further work to improve the user experience and engagement is required before testing the online intervention in a randomized controlled trial.ResultsRecruitment and RetentionDuring recruitment, of the 97 women who expressed interest in the study, 75 women met preliminary screening criteria and subsequently were invited to complete the online eligibility assessment. Five women did not complete the online eligibility assessment, and only 45 women met the study inclusion criteria (see <a href=\"#\">Figure 6</a> for reasons women were excluded). A total of 40 women were enrolled in the study from August to September 2014. The postintervention retention rate was 65% (26/40) and 63% (25/40) at the 3-month follow-up. Although the attrition rate was similar to that predicted (30%), the sample size at follow-up was lower than had been aimed for due to the number of women not meeting eligibility criteria. <a href=\"#\">Figure 6</a> presents the flow of participants through the study.Figure 6\"Mind, Body, Food\" study participant flow diagram.Baseline Characteristics<a href=\"#\">Table 2</a> presents the sample’s demographic characteristics at baseline in comparison with corresponding NZ Census data. The sample was overrepresentative of NZ European women (30/37, 81.1% vs 69.8%) but similarly representative of Māori (4/37, 10.8% vs 11.7%) and Pacific (1/37, 2.7% vs 4.4%) women. University-educated women were overrepresented (21/37, 56.8% vs 17.7%). Women with NZSEI-06 (estimating socioeconomic status) scores in the lower two quartiles were underrepresented (10-33: 2/37, 5.4% vs 23.1%, 34-44: 3/37, 8.1% vs 29.4%). Half (18/36, 50.0%) of women reported dieting for 20 years or longer. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics or other measures such as intuitive eating, binge eating, general mental health, psychological inflexibility, and BMI between women who were retained and not retained at 3-month follow-up.

A programming delay prevented monitoring from the start of the study, which explains missing usage data for three women. Of the 37 participants for whom usage data were available, 12 (32%) completed all 12 modules, 11 (30%) completed 7 to 11 modules, 12 (32%) completed 1 to 6 modules, and two women (5%) completed no modules. The median number of modules completed was 7.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-12) modules. The median number of sessions during the monitored period was 7 (a minimum of 1 session to a maximum of 66 sessions). The median session duration during the monitored period was 12 minutes, 54 seconds (a minimum of 3 minutes, 58 seconds, to a maximum of 100 minutes, 8 seconds). The median number of EAT entries over the 14-week intervention was 7 (a minimum of 1 entry to a maximum of 314 entries). The median number of weeks that participants recorded eating experiences in the EAT was 3 (IQR 1-9) weeks. Of the 40 participants enrolled in the study, 4 women (10%) used the EAT for at least 12 weeks of their intervention period, 7 (18%) used the EAT for 7 to 11 weeks, 20 (50%) used the EAT for 1 to 6 weeks, and 9 (23%) did not use the EAT during their intervention period.Eleven women had limited access to “Mind, Body, Food” for more than 5 days, predominantly due to being away from home (n=8) or technical issues (n=3). Technical issues that prevented module completion included attempting to access “Mind, Body, Food” from an incompatible browser (n=3), using incorrect login details (n=1), and other issues not described (n=1). Seven women reported appetite being affected for more than 5 days (eg, due to illness) during the 14-week intervention.AcceptabilityA total of 26 women completed acceptability measures, and of these 12 had completed all modules, 10 completed 7 to 11 modules, and 4 completed 2 to 6 modules. <a href=\"#\">Table 3</a> shows that participants’ overall impression of “Mind, Body, Food” was positive. Most participants liked “Mind, Body, Food” and found the intervention useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%), easy to understand (23/25, 92%), and would recommend the program to others (21/25, 84%). Nearly half (12/25, 48%) of participants reported that “Mind, Body, Food” made it easy to learn intuitive eating skills.Of all module components, the videos were more frequently rated as being quite or extremely useful by participants compared to the audio and typed activities (<a href=\"#\">Table 3</a>). Five out of 24 women (21%) women rated the EAT self-monitoring tool as quite or extremely useful, 3 out of 19 women (16%) found email reminders to use the EAT useful, and 4 out of 12 women (33%) found SMS reminders to use the EAT useful (not shown). In regards to reminders sent to begin the next module, 17 out of 26 women (68%) rated the email reminders as quite or extremely useful. Of the women (9/24, 38%) who chose to receive SMS reminders to begin the next module, 6 (67%) rated the reminders as useful (not shown).Of the 20 women who currently owned a smartphone, 16 (80%) reported that if it were available a mobile version of “Mind, Body, Food” would be quite or extremely useful to them.Table 3User experiences of “Mind, Body, Food” (n=26).Acceptability measuresn (%)Median<strong>Overall impression</strong><br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent did you like “Mind, Body, Food?”</strong>4<br /> <br /> Disliked very much0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Disliked somewhat0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Neither liked nor disliked3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Liked somewhat10 (40)<br /> <br /> <br /> Liked very much12 (48)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent was “Mind, Body, Food” useful to you?</strong>4<br /> <br /> Not useful0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful4 (15)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful9 (35)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful11 (42)<br /> <br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent did you find “Mind, Body, Food” easy to use?</strong>4<br /> <br /> Not at all easy0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Not very easy3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat easy5 (20)<br /> <br /> <br /> Very easy12 (48)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely easy5 (20)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent did you find “Mind, Body, Food” content easy to understand?</strong>4<br /> <br /> Not at all easy0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Not very easy0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat easy2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Very easy15 (60)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely easy8 (32)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent did “Mind, Body, Food” make it easy for you to learn intuitive eating skills?</strong>3<br /> <br /> Not at all easy0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Not very easy2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat easy11 (44)<br /> <br /> <br /> Very easy9 (36)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely easy3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>Would you recommend “Mind, Body, Food” to others?</strong>5<br /> <br /> No, definitely wouldn’t0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> No, probably wouldn’t0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Unsure4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, probably would8 (32)<br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, definitely would13 (52)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <strong>Usefulness of program features</strong><br /> <strong>How useful did you find the videos?</strong>4<br /> <br /> Not useful0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful7 (28)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful10 (40)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>How useful did you find the audio activities?</strong>3<br /> <br /> Not useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful5 (20)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful7 (28)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful7 (28)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>How useful did you find the typed activities?</strong>3<br /> <br /> Not useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful11 (44)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>How useful did you find the E.A.T.?</strong>2<br /> <br /> Not useful5 (21)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful9 (38)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful5 (21)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful3 (13)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing2<br /> <br /> <strong>How useful did you find the email reminders to begin the next module?</strong>3<br /> <br /> Not useful2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful1 (4)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful5 (20)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful9 (36)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful8 (32)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> Changes in Eating BehaviorThe study was not designed to detect the effects of the intervention on the outcome measures (no control group was included), but within-group comparisons were performed as part of the feasibility component of the pilot study. From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant increases in IES-2 total scores and all four IES-2 subscale scores (<a href=\"#\">Table 4</a>). There was no evidence that these improvements diminished at the 3-month follow-up. Based on use of the dichotomous variable (ie, binge eating vs no binge eating), 7 out of 14 women who reported eating a significantly large amount of food (ie, binge eating) at the preintervention assessment reported no binge eating at the postintervention assessment. There were no women who transitioned from no binge eating at the preintervention assessment to binge eating at the postintervention assessment or at the 3-month follow-up; 4 women who reported binge eating at postintervention no longer reported binge eating at the 3-month follow-up. McNemar’s test revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of women binge eating from the pre- to postintervention visits (<em>P</em>=.01) and a significant decrease from postintervention to follow-up (<em>P</em>&lt;.001). The median days women who were categorized as binge eaters reported binge eating at preintervention was 4.25 (IQR 2.5-10) days, at postintervention was 4 (IQR 2-8) days, and at the 3-month follow-up it was 2 (IQR 2-4) days. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to examine changes in the reported number of days women were unable to prevent or stop episodes of eating an unusually large amount of food and revealed a significant decrease from pre- to postintervention (<em>P</em>=.03) and no evidence of a change from postintervention to follow-up (<em>P</em>=.57).Psychological Inflexibility, Quality of Life, and BMIPsychological inflexibility decreased significantly from pre- to postintervention (mean change −4.23 [SD 7.13], <em>P</em>=.006), and there was a tendency for a further decrease in psychological inflexibility from postintervention to 3-month-follow-up (mean change −2.60 [SD 6.58], <em>P</em>=.06) (<a href=\"#\">Table 4</a>). There were no significant changes in general physical health from pre- to postintervention (pre- to postintervention PCS scores: mean change 0.29 [SD 9.35], <em>P</em>=.88; postintervention to 3-month follow-up PCS scores: mean change 1.26 [SD 10.46], <em>P</em>=.55). However, general mental health improved significantly from pre- to postintervention with a further improvement postintervention to 3-month follow-up (mean change 5.07 [SD 6.31], <em>P</em>&lt;.001; mean change 3.45 [SD 7.71], <em>P</em>=.03, respectively). There were no statistically significant changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention or postintervention to 3-month follow-up (mean change −0.13 [SD 0.88], <em>P</em>=.46 and mean change −0.01 [SD 0.57], <em>P</em>=.93, respectively).Associations Between Changes in Intuitive Eating With BMI and Psychological InflexibilitySpearman correlations showed a statistically significant inverse relationship between pre- to postintervention change in total intuitive eating scores and pre- to postintervention change in BMI (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.43, <em>P</em>=.03). Thus, greater decreases in BMI were associated with greater increases in intuitive eating. However, when relationships with individual subscales were examined, a significant association was found for only one subscale: greater decreases in BMI were associated with greater increases in eating for physical rather than emotional reasons (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.56, <em>P</em>=.003). There was also a statistically significant inverse relationship between change in psychological inflexibility scores and change in intuitive eating scores (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.52, <em>P</em>=.006); that is, greater improvements in psychological flexibility were associated with greater increases in total intuitive eating scores. Furthermore, larger improvements in psychological flexibility were associated with greater increases in two subscale scores: eating for physical rather than emotional reasons (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.41, <em>P</em>=.04) and reliance on hunger and satiety cues (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.62, <em>P</em>&lt;.001). A greater reduction in psychological inflexibility scores was also associated with a greater decrease in BMI (<em>r</em>=.41, <em>P</em>=.04).Table 4Changes from pre- (n=26) to postintervention (n=26) and from postintervention to 3-month follow-up (n=25).CharacteristicMean (SD)Change (SD)<sup>a</sup>95% CI<em>P</em> value<sup>b</sup>IES-2<sup>c</sup> total<br /> Preintervention2.54 (0.58)———<br /> Postintervention3.45 (.55)0.94 (0.67)0.67, 1.21&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow-up3.53 (.61)0.08 (0.55)−0.15, 0.31.47UPE<sup>d</sup><br /> Preintervention3.07 (0.73)———<br /> Postintervention3.56 (.54)0.52 (0.87)0.17, 0.87.01<br /> 3-month follow-up3.47 (.58)−0.09 (0.64)−0.36, 0.17.76EPR<sup>e</sup><br /> Preintervention2.19 (0.96)———<br /> Postintervention3.21 (.89)1.08 (0.96)0.69, 1.46&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow-up3.49 (.88)0.28 (0.89)−0.09, 0.65.13RHS<sup>f</sup><br /> Preintervention2.33 (0.77)———<br /> Postintervention3.58 (.76)1.28 (0.98)0.89, 1.68&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow-up3.55 (.81)−0.03 (0.68)−0.31, 0.25.81B-FCC<sup>g</sup><br /> Preintervention2.87 (0.61)———<br /> Postintervention3.59 (.81)0.74 (0.61)0.50, 1.00&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow-up3.72 (.72)0.13 (0.87)−0.23, 0.49.45BMI<sup>h</sup> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)<br /> Preintervention32.93 (4.85)———<br /> Postintervention32.81 (5.31)−0.13 (0.88)−0.48, 0.23.46<br /> 3-month follow-up<sup>i</sup>32.80 (5.29)−0.01 (0.57)−0.28, 0.26.93AAQ-II<sup>j</sup><br /> Preintervention22.46 (8.67)———<br /> Postintervention18.23 (8.14)−4.23 (7.13)−7.11, -1.35.006<br /> 3-month follow-up16.08 (7.73)−2.60 (6.58)−5.32, 0.16.06SF-12v2 PCS<sup>k</sup><br /> Preintervention50.46 (7.83)———<br /> Postintervention50.87 (11.02)0.29 (9.35)−3.49, 4.06.88<br /> 3-month follow-up52.13 (6.78)1.26 (10.46)−3.06, 5.58.55SF-12v2 MCS<sup>l</sup><br /> Preintervention45.63 (6.31)———<br /> Postintervention50.24 (7.41)5.07 (6.31)2.52, 7.61&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow-up53.70 (4.99)3.45 (7.71)0.27, 6.63.03<a href=\"#fn15\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>15</sup></a><a href=\"#fn16\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>16</sup></a><a href=\"#fn17\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>17</sup></a><a href=\"#fn18\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>18</sup></a><a href=\"#fn19\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>19</sup></a><a href=\"#fn20\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>20</sup></a><a href=\"#fn21\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>21</sup></a><a href=\"#fn22\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>22</sup></a><a href=\"#fn23\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>23</sup></a><a href=\"#fn24\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>24</sup></a><a href=\"#fn25\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>25</sup></a><a href=\"#fn26\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>26</sup></a>alic&gt;

      "# Abstract ## Introduction The objective of this study was to assess the impact of certolizumab pegol (CZP) treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), fatigue and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ## Methods Patients with active RA (N = 982) were randomized 2:2:1 to subcutaneous CZP (400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4; followed by CZP 200 mg or 400 mg) plus methotrexate (MTX) every other week, or placebo (PBO) plus MTX. PRO assessments included HRQoL, fatigue, physical function, arthritis pain and disease activity. Adjusted mean changes from baseline in all PROs were obtained using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) applying last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation. The proportion of patients achieving clinically meaningful improvements in each PRO was obtained using logistic regression and by applying non-responder imputation to missing values after rescue medication or withdrawal. The correlations between PRO responses and clinical responses were also assessed by tetrachoric correlation using non-responder imputation. ## Results Patients treated with CZP plus MTX reported significant (*P* < 0.001), clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL at the first assessment (week 12); reductions in fatigue, disease activity and pain and improvements in physical function were reported at week 1. In particular, CZP-treated patients reported improvements in mental health. Mean changes from baseline in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) at week 52 for CZP 200 mg and 400 mg plus MTX, and PBO plus MTX were 6.4, 6.4 and 2.1, respectively (*P* < 0.001). In addition, mental health and vitality scores in CZP-treated patients approached age- and gender-adjusted US population norms. Improvements in all PROs were sustained. Similar benefits were reported with both CZP doses. Changes in SF-36 MCS scores had the lowest correlation with disease activity scores (DAS28) and American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement (ACR20) response rates, while improvements in pain showed the highest correlation. ## Conclusions Treatment with CZP plus MTX resulted in rapid and sustained improvements in all PROs, indicating that the benefits of CZP extend beyond clinical efficacy endpoints into areas that are more relevant and meaningful for patients on a daily basis. ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00152386. # Results ## Patients A total of 982 patients were randomized in RAPID 1: 393 to CZP 200 mg plus MTX, 390 to CZP 400 mg plus MTX, and 199 to PBO plus MTX. Of these, 255 (64.9%), 274 (70.3%) and 43 (21.6%) completed 52 weeks of treatment, respectively [[28](#)]. At baseline, 82% of patients were female, with mean age 52 years, 77% rheumatoid factor positive, mean disease duration 6.2 years, and having failed a mean of 1.4 disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; excluding MTX). The burden of RA at baseline was significant, as evidenced by patient-reported global assessment of disease activity, pain, physical function, and fatigue scores (Table [1](#)). In particular, SF-36 domain scores at baseline were markedly lower than age- and gender-matched US population norms, and SF-36 MCS and PCS scores reflected a significant psychological burden as well as physical impairments. ::::table-wrap\n",

By the end of the study at week 52, mean scores were 1.1 for both CZP plus MTX treatment groups, respectively, compared with baseline scores of 1.7. Significantly more CZP plus MTX-treated patients than PBO plus MTX-treated patients reported HAQ-DI improvements equal to or greater than the MCID throughout the trial (*P* < 0.001). CZP-treated patients also reported statistically significant improvements in physical function that met or exceeded MCID as reported above for SF-36 PCS (Figure [1a](#)) and Physical Functioning domain scores (Table [2](#)). CZP-treated patients reported significant improvements from baseline in pain VAS (Figure [3c](#)) and patient's global assessment of disease activity (Figure [3d](#); *P* < 0.001), evident at week 1 and sustained through week 52. Significantly more CZP plus MTX-treated patients than PBO plus MTX-treated patients also reported clinically meaningful reductions in pain (Figure [4c](#)) and improvements in global assessment of disease activity (Figure [4d](#)) throughout the trial (*P* < 0.001). Results were similar regardless of CZP dose (200 mg or 400 mg). Sensitivity analyses showed that improvements in all PROs were consistent with the LOCF results. ## Comparison of patient-reported outcomes with DAS28 and ACR20 response rates To explore the relation between the patient-reported outcomes and the physician-reported assessments of disease, PRO responses (as defined by improvements in physical function, pain, fatigue and SF-36 scores equal to or greater than the MCIDs) were compared with DAS28 responses (defined as a decrease from baseline of ≥ 1.2) and ACR20 response rates at week 52. In general, PRO responses were in agreement with clinical responses as determined by either improvements in RA signs and symptoms (ACR20 response rates) or decrease in disease activity (DAS28 scores; Table [3](#)). As expected, classification of response according to physical function and pain was highly correlated with ACR20 response rates, with 88.8% and 93.6% of patients treated with CZP 200 mg plus MTX being classified the same by physical function/ACR20 and pain/ACR20, respectively. Correlations between fatigue and ACR20 responses were also high (90.0%) as were those between patient's global assessment of disease activity (98.0%), while changes in HRQoL (SF-36 PCS and MCS scores) had the lowest correlation with ACR20 responses (84.3% and 77.4%, respectively). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background: Induced hypothermia for treatment of traumatic brain injury is controversial. Since many pathways involved in the pathophysiology of secondary brain injury are temperature dependent, regional brain hypothermia is thought capable to mitigate those processes. The objectives of this study are to assess the therapeutic effects and complications of regional brain cooling in severe head injury with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) 6-7. ## Materials and Methods: A prospective randomized controlled pilot study involving patients with severe traumatic brain injury with GCS 6 and 7 who required decompressive craniectomy. Patients were randomized into two groups: Cooling and no cooling. For the cooling group, analysis was made by dividing the group into mild and deep cooling. Brain was cooled by irrigating the brain continuously with cold Hartmann solution for 24-48 h. Main outcome assessments were a dichotomized Glasgow outcome score (GOS) at 6 months posttrauma. ## Results: A total of 32 patients were recruited. The cooling-treated patients did better than no cooling. There were 63.2% of patients in cooling group attained good GOS at 6 months compared to only 15.4% in noncooling group (*P* = 0.007). Interestingly, the analysis at 6 months post-trauma disclosed mild-cooling-treated patients did better than no cooling (70% vs. 15.4% attained good GOS, *P* = 0.013) and apparently, the deep-cooling-treated patients failed to be better than either no cooling (*P* = 0.074) or mild cooling group (*P* = 0.650). ## Conclusion: Data from this pilot study imply direct regional brain hypothermia appears safe, feasible and maybe beneficial in treating severely head-injured patients. # Results ## Demographic and clinical characteristics A total of 32 patients were recruited into the 2 years study period from 1^st^ January 2010 to 1^st^ January 2012, aged between 14 and 74 years old. Of these, five patients aged more than 60 years old (19.2%). There were 27 (84.4%) males and 5 (15.6%) females. Patients were randomized into 2 groups; cooling group consisted of 19 patients (59.4%) and no cooling group consisted of 13 patients (40.6%). Finally, further stratification of cooling group based on the temperature of infused solution created 3 analyzable groups; mild cooling consisted of 10 patients (31.3%), deep cooling of 9 patients (28.1%) and no cooling of 13 patients (40.6%). The mean ages of the recruited patients were 28.9, 26.7 and 45.5 years old for the mild cooling, deep cooling and no cooling groups, respectively. Fifteen patients were admitted with GCS of 6 (46.9%) and 17 patients with GCS of 7 (53.1%). Among these, 28 patients (87.5%) underwent unilateral decompresive craniectomy, while four patients had bifrontal decompressive craniectomy (12.5%). [Table 1](#) illustrates those parameters where all groups were comparable with non-statistical difference shown for gender, GCS, ISS, Marshall score and clotting profiles. Age was the only basic parameters that differed among the three studied groups (*P* = 0.02). Even though the highest mean age was found in the control group, the 95% CIs (95% CI) for all three groups were still within the age of <60 years old. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "![]():::: ## Effect of regional brain cooling on Glasgow outcome score There was a strong significant difference at 6 months post-trauma outcomes with *P* = 0.007 between the two studied groups: Cooling versus no cooling [[Table 2](#)]. There were 63.2% of patients (12 patients) in cooling group attained good GOS at 6 months compared with only 15.4% in non-cooling group (2 patients). There was no significant difference between the two groups when outcomes analysis was made at time of discharge. Further analysis at 6 months post-trauma was made after stratifying the cooling group into 2: Mild and deep cooling. [Table 3](#) disclosed presence of significant difference among the three analyzed groups at 6 months post-trauma (*P* = 0.023). When comparison was only made between 2 groups (no cooling vs mild cooling; no cooling vs deep cooling and mild cooling vs deep cooling), it seems that the mild-cooling-treated patients fared better than no cooling (70% of mild cooling attained good GOS compared with only 15.4% attained good GOS in no cooling group, *P* = 0.013); and apparently, the deep-cooling-treated patients failed to be better than either no cooling (*P* = 0.074) or mild cooling group (*P* = 0.650). ::::table-wrap\n",

Cooling the severely injured brain which had underwent decompressive craniectomy did not reduce the ICP further, but instead shown marked improvements in CPP and Licox PtiO~2~ after 12 h of cooling. [Figure 2](#) discloses mean IC*P* values and patterns for the three studied groups. All ICP readings stayed below 25 mmHg, and marked fluctuations were noted in cooling groups. Figures [3](#) and [4](#) reveal mean values and trends for CPP and Licox PtiO~2~, respectively. Mild cooling group had ascending trends of CPP with mean values above 60 mmHg but <75 mmHg together with PtiO~2~ mean values of above 40 mmHg after 12 h of cooling therapy. Interestingly, the deep cooling group did have similar ascending trends for CPP and PtiO~2~ but their mean values after 12 h of cooling therapy were above 75 mmHg and <30 mmHg, respectively. [Figure 5](#) gives additional information on brain-body (axillary) temperature gradient and types of cooling therapy. Patients in mild cooling group appeared to have a larger difference in brain-body (axillary) temperature gradient.

Trend analysis of seven patients in mild cooling and eight patients in deep cooling showed obvious decrements in values for both, T cell markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines after cooling therapy. Intriguingly, markers for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF) did show more marked decrement than markers for T-cell [[Table 4](#)]. Despite of marked decrement in most studied immunological biomarkers after cooling therapy, the Wilcoxon Signed Ranked test for two related samples disclosed insignificant difference between pre- and post-cooling for all immunological parameters. This presumably related to our small sample size, which incapable to detect significant differences in those studied immunological parameters. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract # Abstract ***Objectives:*** To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of desvenlafaxine (25--50 mg/d) compared with placebo in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). ***Methods:*** Outpatient children (7--11 years) and adolescents (12--17 years) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD and had screening and baseline Children's Depression Rating Scale--Revised (CDRS-R) total scores >40 were randomly assigned to 8-week treatment with placebo, desvenlafaxine (25, 35, or 50 mg/d based on baseline weight), or fluoxetine (20 mg/d). The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Secondary efficacy endpoints included week 8 Clinical Global Impressions--Severity, Clinical Global Impressions--Improvement (CGI-I), and response (CGI-I ≤ 2). Safety assessments included adverse events, physical and vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. ***Results:*** The safety population included 339 patients (children, *n* = 130; adolescents, *n* = 209). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, did not statistically separate from placebo, for either desvenlafaxine (adjusted mean [standard error] change, −22.6 [1.17]) or fluoxetine (−24.8 [1.17]; placebo, −23.1 [1.18]). Week 8 CGI-I response rates were significantly greater for fluoxetine (78.2%; *p* = 0.017) than for placebo (62.6%); desvenlafaxine (68.7%) did not differ from placebo. Other secondary outcomes were consistent with those obtained with CDRS-R. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable among treatment groups (desvenlafaxine, 60.0%; placebo, 70.5%; and fluoxetine, 64.3%). ***Conclusion:*** Desvenlafaxine did not demonstrate efficacy for treating MDD in children and adolescents in this trial. Because neither desvenlafaxine nor the reference medication, fluoxetine, demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo on the primary endpoint, this was considered a failed trial and no efficacy conclusions can be drawn. Desvenlafaxine 25--50 mg/d was generally safe and well tolerated in children and adolescents in this study. # Results ## Study population A total of 340 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 339 patients (children, *n* = 130; adolescents, *n* = 209) were included in the safety population (desvenlafaxine, *n* = 115; fluoxetine, *n* = 112; placebo, *n* = 112). The ITT population included 130 children and 207 adolescents. A total of 42 (12%) patients discontinued early (desvenlafaxine, 16 [14%]; fluoxetine, 13 [12%]; and placebo, 13 [12%]). Lost to follow-up was the most common reason for discontinuation from the desvenlafaxine and placebo groups; in the fluoxetine group, the most common reason for discontinuation was \"no longer willing to participate\" ([Fig. 1](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Study flow. <sup>a</sup>One patient was screened and, although not randomized, received a total of eight blinded placebo doses. The patient was discontinued after the week 1 visit once the error was identified and listed as a protocol violation.</figcaption> </figure> Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable among treatment groups for both children and adolescents ([Table 1](#)). Mean (SD) CDRS-R Total Score at baseline was 56.5 (8.9), mean (SD) CGI-S score was 4.5 (0.6), and the duration of the most recent depressive episode ranged from 1 to 96 months (median, 7; mean [SD], 13.4 [15.1]). Overall, 30.4% (103) of patients in the safety population had a prior or active psychiatric condition other than MDD in their medical history (desvenlafaxine, 31.3%; fluoxetine, 25.9%; and placebo, 33.9%). The most common psychiatric conditions (reported by ≥2% of patients) included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (desvenlafaxine, 12.2%; fluoxetine, 13.4%; and placebo, 5.4%), nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (desvenlafaxine, 7.0%; fluoxetine, 8.0%; and placebo, 12.5%), insomnia (desvenlafaxine, 7.0%; fluoxetine, 6.3%; and placebo, 8.0%), generalized anxiety disorder (desvenlafaxine, 0.9%; fluoxetine, 6.3%; and placebo, 0), and oppositional defiant disorder (desvenlafaxine, 3.5%; fluoxetine, 3.6%; and placebo, 0). ::::table-wrap\n",

Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity. AEs considered by the investigator to be related to study medication were reported by 31.9% of patients (desvenlafaxine, 28.7%; fluoxetine, 32.1%; and placebo, 34.8%). Severe AEs (those that interfered significantly with patients' usual function) considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study medication were reported by 3.5% of patients (desvenlafaxine, 1.7%; fluoxetine, 5.4%; and placebo, 3.6%). In three patients, severe AEs were considered related to study medication: One desvenlafaxine-treated patient reported severe pruritus and severe macular rash and discontinued treatment. One placebo-treated patient reported severe agitation and severe anger, and a second reported severe insomnia; neither was discontinued due to those AEs. Five adolescents (0 children) discontinued due to AEs, two each from the desvenlafaxine (disinhibition; macular rash and pruritus) and placebo (vomiting; headache) groups and one from the fluoxetine group (suicidal ideation). ### Treatment-emergent adverse events Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by more than 10% of patients in any group were headache, upper abdominal pain, and nausea. [Table 3](#) shows the most frequent (≥5% in any group) TEAEs by age group, and overall.

Five randomized patients experienced serious AEs: two assigned to fluoxetine (suicidal ideation [acute suicidality; discontinued] and suicide attempt [occurred poststudy], one patient each), three assigned to desvenlafaxine (suicidal ideation [discontinued due to lack of confidence in caregiver reliability to report patient status], disinhibition [discontinued], and postpartum hemorrhage with anemia and endometritis [occurred poststudy], one patient each), and no placebo-treated patients. The desvenlafaxine-treated patient with postpartum hemorrhage had been withdrawn from the study following a positive pregnancy test at the final treatment phase visit and delivered a healthy full-term infant. ### Suicidality A summary of C-SSRS results for treatment-emergent suicidal ideation or behavior is presented for the safety population in [Table 4](#) (full C-SSRS results are presented in [Supplementary Table S3](#)). Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior, which included both new-onset and worsening suicidal ideation or behavior, was reported for 29 (8.6%) of 337 patients who had a C-SSRS assessment at baseline and at 1 or more postbaseline time points. A total of 29/337 (8.6%) patients had treatment-emergent suicidal ideation, and 1 patient (0.3%) also had treatment-emergent suicidal behavior. The suicidal behavior event was categorized as a preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior (preparatory acts or behavior; interrupted attempt) and was reported in a fluoxetine-treated adolescent ([Supplementary Table S3](#)). The patient was discontinued due to a serious AE of acute suicidality (described in \"Deaths and Serious AEs\" section). ::::table-wrap\n",

The suicide attempt reported as a serious AE in the \"Deaths and Serious AEs\" section was not captured on the C-SSRS because it occurred poststudy. ### Other safety measures The frequencies of patients with on-therapy potentially clinically important (PCI) vital sign values can be found in [Supplementary Table S4](#). Upon review of patient data by the medical monitor, eight patients (all adolescents) were deemed to have clinically important vital sign results: postural hypotension in three desvenlafaxine-treated patients (35-, 35-, and 50-mg/d doses) and in four fluoxetine-treated patients, and increased supine systolic blood pressure in one desvenlafaxine-treated patient (122--126 mm Hg at weeks 3--6; baseline, 117 mm Hg). No patients assigned to placebo had clinically important vital sign findings, and the observed changes from baseline in body mass index (BMI) were negligible. Mean changes from baseline in BMI, blood pressure, and pulse measurements are reported by age group in [Supplementary Table S5](#). Expected shifts associated with development assessed by Tanner staging were observed during the study. Clinically important ECG findings were reported for one patient assigned to fluoxetine who had Wolff--Parkinson--White syndrome at study entry, with no change over the course of the study. The frequencies of on-therapy PCI laboratory findings are presented in [Supplementary Table S6](#). Findings in nine patients (four desvenlafaxine, five fluoxetine) were determined to be clinically important: three had elevated triglycerides (two desvenlafaxine, one fluoxetine), one high prolactin (desvenlafaxine), one low hematocrit and low hemoglobin (desvenlafaxine), three positive urine protein (fluoxetine), and one abnormal liver function test (fluoxetine). No clinically important laboratory values were observed in the placebo group. Mean changes from baseline for selected laboratory values are reported by age group and treatment in [Supplementary Table S7](#).\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background The purpose of the present study was to compare the image quality of spinal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed on a high-field horizontal open versus a short-bore MR scanner in a randomized controlled study setup. ## Methods Altogether, 93 (80% women, mean age 53) consecutive patients underwent spine imaging after random assignement to a 1-T horizontal open MR scanner with a vertical magnetic field or a 1.5-T short-bore MR scanner. This patient subset was part of a larger cohort. Image quality was assessed by determining qualitative parameters, signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR), and quantitative contour sharpness. ## Results The image quality parameters were higher for short-bore MR imaging. Regarding all sequences, the relative differences were 39% for the mean overall qualitative image quality, 53% for the mean SNR values, and 34--37% for the quantitative contour sharpness (*P*<0.0001). The CNR values were also higher for images obtained with the short-bore MR scanner. No sequence was of very poor (nondiagnostic) image quality. Scanning times were significantly longer for examinations performed on the open MR scanner (mean: 32±22 min versus 20±9 min; *P*<0.0001). ## Conclusions In this randomized controlled comparison of spinal MR imaging with an open versus a short-bore scanner, short-bore MR imaging revealed considerably higher image quality with shorter scanning times. ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT00715806](#) # Results ## Participants Of 174 enrolled patients, 106 had a clinical indication for MR imaging of the spine: 35 cervicothoracic spine, 61 thoracolumbar spine, 10 whole spine. Of these 106 patients, 93 underwent MR imaging, and all were included in this analysis ([Figure 1](#)). [Table 1](#) lists the baseline characteristics of the patients included. They were well matched between both groups. Eighty percent of the patients were women who have been shown to be more likely to suffer from claustrophobia [[8]](#). The mean age was 53 (SD, 12; range, 27-88), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 29 (SD, 7.5; range, 17.5--52). All patients were at increased risk to suffer from claustrophobia. The mean CLQ score was 2,35 (SD, 0.69) which is in accordance with other high-risk groups [[16]](#). Moreover, 50.5% of the 93 patients had prior MR imaging which was prevented, aborted or performed with sedation due to claustrophobia. Indications for MR imaging included: radicular pain (n = 60), (non-motor) neurologic symptoms and/or deficits (n = 60), motor deficits (n = 28), history of prior surgery (n = 10), cauda equina syndrome (n = 4), suspicion of cancer (n = 3), and history of previous trauma (n = 2). Some patients had more than one clinical indication for MR imaging. All indications were appropriate according to American College of Radiology guidelines [[8]](#), [[19]](#), [[20]](#). ::::table-wrap\n",

Only one patient aborted MR imaging on the first scanner due to claustrophobia after one sequence, which was thus not included in the primary analysis. The other patients who were imaged after cross-referral rejected MR imaging on the first scanner before the examination had started ([Figure 1](#)). Thus, none of the patients was scanned on both scanners. Details of the MR imaging characteristics are listed in [Table 2](#). Scanning times were significantly longer for open MR imaging and the perceived noise and pain levels were also higher, although statistically not significant, in patients who were examined with the open MR scanner [[8]](#). ::::table-wrap\n",

No sequence was rated very poor (nondiagnostic). Thus image quality scores ranged from 1 (optimal) to 4 (poor). [Table 3](#) shows the respective results computed separately for all qualitative parameters which were assessed. There were significantly more artifacts in sagittal T1-weighted sequences of the cervicothoracic and the thoracolumbar spine and in axial T2-weighted sequences of the thoracolumbar spine when obtained with the open MR scanner. Relevant artifacts were mainly due to motion for both, short-bore and open MR imaging. However, none of the examinations showed severe artifacts limiting their diagnostic value. Subgroup analyses excluding patients who underwent imaging after cross-referral revealed equally distributed results (*P*<0.0001, data not shown). Analysis of only those examinations which were performed with sedation also revealed higher qualitative image quality ratings for short-bore MR, but significant differences were only found for axial sequences (data not shown).

The results computed separately for the different sequences of the cervicothoracic and the thoracolumbar spine are listed in [Table 4](#). SNR was assessed for corticospinal fluid, spinal cord, vertebral bone, fat tissue, and muscle and an overall mean value was calculated. The mean SNR values of all available sequences were significantly higher for short-bore MR images than for open MR images (17.97 [SD, 6.58] versus 11.28 [SD, 4.35]; *P*<0.0001). The CNR values calculated were also higher for images obtained with the short-bore MR scanner ([Table 4](#)). Regarding quantitative assessment of contour sharpness, the mean values for the two assessed interfaces were significantly smaller in MR images obtained with the short-bore scanner than with the open MR scanner, thus indicating an improved contour sharpness (0.95 [SD, 0.24] versus 1.43 [SD, 0.48] and 0.83 [SD, 0.22] versus 1.32 [SD, 0.51]; *P*<0.0001). The detailed results of the contour sharpness measurement are also shown in [Figures 6](#) and [7](#). Subgroup analyses of patients who underwent MR imaging without cross-referral and of sedated patients revealed similar results (data not shown). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0083427.g006 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Contour Sharpness in MR images of the Cervicothoracic Spine.<br /> Contour sharpness as distance in mm (±SD) that is neeeded for the signal to increase from 25% to 75% of the grayscale pixel value profile obtained with imageJ (see <a href=\"#\">Figure S1</a>).

      "# Abstract ## Background Extending contact with participants after initial, intensive intervention may support maintenance of weight loss and related behaviors. ## Objective This community-wide trial evaluated a text message (short message service, SMS)-delivered, extended contact intervention ('Get Healthy, Stay Healthy' (GHSH)), which followed on from a population-level, behavioral telephone coaching program. ## Methods This study employed a parallel, randomized controlled trial: GHSH compared with no continued contact (standard practice). Participants (n=228) were recruited after completing a 6-month lifestyle telephone coaching program: mean age = 53.4 (standard deviation (SD)=12.3) years; 66.7% (152/228) female; mean body mass index (BMI) upon entering GHSH=29.5 kg/m2 (SD = 6.0). Participants received tailored text messages over a 6-month period. The message frequency, timing, and content of the messages was based on participant preference, ascertained during two tailoring telephone calls. Primary outcomes of body weight, waist circumference, physical activity (walking, moderate, and vigorous sessions/week), and dietary behaviors (fruit and vegetable serves/day, cups of sweetened drinks per day, takeaway meals per week; fat, fiber and total indices from the Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire) were assessed via self-report before (baseline) and after (6-months) extended contact (with moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) also assessed via accelerometry). ## Results Significant intervention effects, all favoring the intervention group, were observed at 6-months for change in weight (-1.35 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.24, -0.46, *P*=.003), weekly moderate physical activity sessions (0.56 sessions/week, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.96, *P*=.008) and accelerometer-assessed MVPA (24.16 minutes/week, 95% CI: 5.07, 43.25, *P*=.007). Waist circumference, other physical activity outcomes and dietary outcomes, did not differ significantly between groups. ## Conclusions The GHSH extended care intervention led to significantly better anthropometric and physical activity outcomes than standard practice (no contact). This evidence is useful for scaling up the delivery of GHSH as standard practice following the population-level telephone coaching program. # Results ## Participants There were 1071 clients invited to participate in this study, of whom 300 expressed verbal interest in participating in the trial, and 228 participants consented and were randomized (228/300, 76%; [Figure 1](#)). [Table 1](#) shows the demographic characteristics of GHSH participants (intervention, n=114; control, n=114). Upon entering the GHSH trial, participants (152/228, 67% female) had a mean age of 53.4 (standard deviation (SD) = 12.3) years and BMI of 29.5 kg/m^2^(SD = 6.0), 34% (78/228) were overweight and 38% (87/228) were obese, 40% (91/228) did not meet physical activity guidelines [[28](#)] (ie, <150 minutes MVPA per week), and 80% (182/228) did not consume the recommended serves of fruit (ie, two) and/or vegetables (ie, five) per day [[29](#)].The GHSH sample was not representative of all participants completing the final GHS coaching call. Odds of being in the GHSH trial were significantly higher than their respective counterparts for those: aged <60 years; not working; without a post school qualification; self-reported diagnosis of hypertension; self-reported diagnosis of high cholesterol; doing no vigorous activity; and, who consume <1 takeaway meal per week ([Multimedia Appendix 2](#)). The overall retention rate from baseline to 6 months was 95% (216/228) (103/114, 90% in intervention and 113/114, 99% in controls, *P*=.005). Most intervention participants (98/114, 86%) and controls (107/114, 94%) had full data on all outcomes at 6-month follow-up and on the baseline and prestudy covariates examined ( *P*=.077). Missing data was associated with: higher baseline BMI (mean ± SD for missing vs complete; <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Participation in the Get Healthy, Stay Healthy (GHSH) trial.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

Participant's reasons for discontinuing the intervention are shown in [Figure 1](#), with the most common reasons being that they were too busy (4/13) or that the intervention was not working for them (4/13). ## Anthropometric and Behavior Change Results ### Anthropometric Outcomes Intervention participants showed significant reductions in both body weight (−0.89 kg, 95% CI: −1.53, −0.25) and waist circumference (−1.34 cm, 95% CI: −2.31, −0.36; [Table 2](#)). Intervention group improvements were significantly greater than controls for weight loss (−1.35 kg, 95% CI: −2.24, −0.46, *P*=.003), but not for waist circumference ( *P*=.115; [Table 3](#)). ### Physical Activity The intervention group maintained their accelerometer-assessed MVPA and self-reported vigorous activity, and changed significantly only in self-reported walking (−0.55, 95% CI: −0.99, −0.11 sessions/week; [Table 2](#)). The control group changed significantly in moderate activity and MVPA, which both declined (−0.68, 95% CI: −1.11, -0.26 sessions/week, and −16.10, 95% CI −28.60, −3.61 min/week; [Table 2](#)). The intervention group did significantly better than the control group in moderate activity (0.56, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.96 sessions/week) and in accelerometer-assessed MVPA (24.16, 95% CI: 5.07, 43.25 min/week; [Table 3](#)). Intervention effects for walking and vigorous activity were not significant ([Table 3](#)). ### Dietary Behaviors In the intervention group, small, but statistically significant improvements in dietary outcomes were observed for the FFBQ Fiber and Total Indices, while remaining dietary outcomes, except takeaway meals per week, were all maintained ([Table 2](#)). By contrast, in the control group, there were no statistically significant improvements, only statistically significant declines in vegetable intake and fruit intake ([Table 2](#)). Other dietary outcomes were maintained. No significant or meaningful intervention effect for dietary outcomes was observed. ### Sensitivity Analyses Results from analyses using multiple imputation mostly supported the interpretations from the main analyses ([Multimedia Appendix 4](#)), except that due to slightly narrower CIs in the multiple imputation analysis, the intervention group maintained takeaway meals/week (rather than being 'inconclusive') and the intervention effect for vegetable serves/day was 'similar' (rather than 'inconclusive'). Conclusions using the alternative models mostly supported the main findings ([Multimedia Appendix 5](#)) and revealed significant differences in walking ( *P*=.018). The intervention group showed a greater tendency to walk than controls (odds ratio = 2.17, 95% CI: 0.45, 10.43, *P*=.334), but also to report fewer walking sessions when they did walk than controls (relative rate = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.92, *P*=.005). ## Feasibility Results The mean (±SD) call duration was 34 ±8 minutes for the initial tailoring call and 18 ±8 minutes for the 12-week tailoring call. The median number of text messages requested during the initial tailoring call and at the 12-week tailoring call were both five per fortnight (25^th^-75^th^percentiles =3-7 texts). During the initial tailoring call, 40% (46/111) of participants requested fortnightly goal checks for both behavioral goals; 35% (40/111) weekly for both goals; and, 22%(25/111) weekly for one goal and fortnightly for the other goal. Approximately one-half the participants (58/111, 52%) did not request any real-time behavioral prompts and 35% (39/111) requested between 2-4 prompts per fortnight. Almost all (89/95, 94%) intervention participants still enrolled at 12-weeks completed the 12-week tailoring interview. During the 12-week tailoring call, almost all (82/89, 92%) participants changed their preference for text message content, and 40% (36/89) changed their preferred text message schedule. Outside of the 12-week tailoring call, only 3% (3/90) of participants changed either of these preferences via text. The weight goal reset text received replies from 30% (33/111) of participants at week 6 and 26% (25/95) at week 18. At week 6, 40% (44/111) of participants reset at least one behavioral goal; 29% (28/95) did so in week 18. Intervention completers (n=90) replied to 84% of goal check texts sent in week 1 (152/180) and 69% (125/180) of goal check texts sent in the last week. ## Acceptability Results Most (69/99, 70%) participants rated GHSH as \"useful\" or \"extremely useful\" in supporting their weight goal, and 75% (74/99) reported that they were \"satisfied\" or \"extremely satisfied\" with the intervention. Follow-up interviews with 62 intervention participants revealed that: experience with text messaging prior to GHSH impacted on participants' experience during the intervention; the GHSH program often exceeded participants' expectations; and participants generally perceived the GHS and GHSH intervention to be one program. Reasons for liking GHSH focused on: the reminders provided by the text messages to reinforce what participants wanted to do; maintaining accountability; and increased awareness of behaviors in real time. The few participants who did not like aspects of the GHSH nominated text messages being too repetitive or automated as key reasons. ## Costs of Intervention Delivery Results Health coach staff spent, on average, 35 minutes per participant conducting and preparing for the initial tailoring interview and 30 minutes for the 12-week tailoring interview. Research staff spent on average 31 minutes per participant entering tailoring data into the software following the initial tailoring call and 15 minutes per participant after the 12-week tailoring call. Research staff had to manually trigger responses to 813 goal check replies not recognized by the software (813/2071, 39%) of responses received), which took approximately 1 minute per response. During the intervention, 8518 text messages were sent to participants (at AU$0.15 each) totaling AU$1278 (averaging AU$11.21 per participant). Overall, it cost approximately AU$80.00 per participant to deliver the GHSH extended contact intervention. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objectives: The supermarket industry now services many customers through online food shopping over the Internet. The Internet shopping process offers a novel opportunity for the modification of dietary patterns. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on consumers' purchases of saturated fat of a fully automated computerised system that provided real-time advice tailored to the consumers' specific purchases recommending foods lower in saturated fat. ## Design: This study was a blinded, randomised controlled trial. ## Setting: The study was conducted in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. ## Participants: The participants were consumers using a commercial online Internet shopping site between February and June 2004. ## Interventions: Individuals assigned to intervention received fully automated advice that recommended specific switches from selected products higher in saturated fat to alternate similar products lower in saturated fat. Participants assigned to control received general non-specific advice about how to eat a diet lower in saturated fat. ## Outcome Measures: The outcome measure was the difference in saturated fat (grams per 100 g of food) in shopping baskets between the intervention and control groups. ## Results: There were 497 randomised participants, mean age 40 y, each shopping for an average of about three people. The amount of saturated fat in the foods purchased by the intervention group was 0.66% lower (95% confidence interval 0.48--0.84, *p* < 0.001) than in the control group. The effects of the intervention were sustained over consecutive shopping episodes, and there was no difference in the average cost of the food bought by each group. ## Conclusions: Fully automated, purchase-specific dietary advice offered to customers during Internet shopping can bring about changes in food purchasing habits that are likely to have significant public health implications. Because implementation is simple to initiate and maintain, this strategy would likely be highly cost-effective. # RESULTS ## Participants A total of 4,548 individuals were offered participation, and 497 were randomised (251 intervention and 246 control) ([Figure 1](#)). Of these, 456 (224 intervention and 232 control) completed at least one episode of shopping that included one or more of the 524 foods studied. Median follow-up time completed by the end of the study in June 2004 was 35 d, and the median number of shopping episodes done by participants was three (range 1--20). The baseline characteristics documented on the questionnaire were balanced between randomised groups, with a mean participant age of 40 y and a proportion female of 88% ([Table 1](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow Chart of Study</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "![]():::: ## Outcomes and Estimation For the first occasion on which advice was offered, the amount of saturated fat in the food purchased by the intervention group after advice was a mean of 0.66% (0.48--0.84, *p <* 0.001) lower than in the corresponding foods purchased by the control group ([Table 2](#)), which is equivalent to an approximate 10% reduction in saturated fat content of foods purchased ([Figure 2](#)). This difference resulted from a decrease in the mean saturated fat content in the foods purchased following the advice offered to the intervention group of 0.77% (0.60--0.94, *p <* 0.001), with no corresponding decrease in the control group 0.04% (0.00--0.08, *p =* 0.07). The effect estimate for the primary outcome was 0.62% (0.46--0.79, *p <* 0.001) if analysis was restricted to only the 456 individuals that selected one of the 524 foods studied and was 0.58 (0.39--0.77, *p <* 0.001) if the change in saturated fat was set to zero for those individuals that did not select one of the foods. The subgroup analyses provided some evidence that the intervention had greater effects among individuals with higher body mass index and among people above 40 y of age (for both, homogeneity *p* < 0.03) ([Table 3](#)). There was no baseline variable that substantively altered the main result as a consequence of its inclusion or exclusion as a covariate. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "![]():::: A secondary outcome of the study was to assess the impact of the intervention on the cost of foods purchased online. The mean cost per 100 g of the foods purchased by the intervention group was not different from that in the control group (intervention AUD$0.63 [0.58--0.68]/100 g versus control AUD$0.62 [0.58--0.67]/100 g, *p =* 0.19). The foods higher in saturated fat that were most commonly present in the shopping basket prior to advice being offered but absent after the advice had been offered were higher-fat dairy products. Lower-fat dairy products were the items most frequently added to the shopping basket after advice was provided. ## Ancillary Analyses The effects of the intervention over repeated episodes of shopping were explored amongst the 115 participants that completed six shopping episodes during the study. These analyses demonstrated that for the intervention group the magnitude of the reduction in saturated fat achieved was greater in earlier compared to later shopping episodes (for trend, *p* = 0.01) ([Figure 2](#)) and showed that there was no effect of the control condition on saturated fat during any shopping episode (*p* > 0.09 for all six shopping episodes in the control group).\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background Rocuronium has been well known to produce withdrawal response in 50-80% patients when administered intravenously. Several drugs are administered prior injection of rocuronium to prevent the withdrawal response. We compared the preventive effect of lidocaine, ketamine, and remifentanil on the withdrawal response of rocuronium. ## Methods A total of 120 patients undergoing various elective surgeries were enrolled. Patients were allocated into 4 groups according to the pretreatment drugs (Group N, normal saline; Groups L, lidocaine 40 mg; Group K, ketamine 0.5 mg/kg; Group R, remifentanil 1 µg/kg). Patients received drugs prepared by dilution to 3 ml volume before injection of rocuronium. Withdrawal responses after injection of rocuronium were graded on a 4-point scale. Hemodynamic changes were observed before and after administration of pretreatment drugs and after endotracheal intubation. ## Results Incidence of withdrawal response was significantly lower in group L (20%), group K (30%), and group R (0%), than group N (87%). Severe withdrawal response was observed in 5 of the 30 patients (17%) in group L, and in 9 of the 30 patients (30%) in group K. There was no severe withdrawal response in group R. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were significantly decreased in group R compared to other groups. ## Conclusions It seems that remifentanil (1 µg/kg intravenously) was the strongest and most effective in prevention of withdrawal response after rocuronium injection among the 3 drugs. # Results There were no dropouts and the data from all 120 patients could be analyzed. There were no significant differences among the groups in demographic data ([Table 1](#)). The incidence of withdrawal response was 87% (26/30), 20% (6/30), 30% (9/30), and 0% in group N, group L, group K, and group R, respectively ([Table 2](#)). Severe withdrawal response which is >2 on the 4-point scale occurred in 25 patients (84%) in group N (P < 0.00833). However, it was observed in 5 patients (17%) in group L, in 9 patients (30%) in group K, and in no patient in group R, respectively. The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) to prevent pain in one who would have had pain was 1.49, 1.75, and 1.15 in group L, group K, and group R, respectively. Lidocaine (40 mg), ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), or remifentanil (1 µg/kg) decreased the withdrawal response significantly and remifentanil (1 µg/kg) was the most effective in the prevention of withdrawal response among the drugs (P < 0.00833) ([Table 2](#)). There were no significant differences in mean blood pressure and heart rate before injection of pretreatment drugs among the groups ([Figs. 1](#) and [2](#)). However, there were significant decreases in group R compared to control and other groups after injection of pretreatment drugs ([Figs. 1](#) and [2](#)). After intubation, mean blood pressure was increased in group N, group L, and group K compared to control ([Fig. 1](#)). However, in group R, mean blood pressure was significantly lower compared to other groups (P < 0.05) ([Fig. 1](#)). Heart rate increased significantly compared to control in all groups but, it was significantly lower in group R compared to other groups (P < 0.05) ([Fig. 2](#)). No erythema, venous sequels, or adverse event were observed in any patient. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Sequential changes of mean blood pressure before and after intravenous injection of normal saline, lidocaine, ketamine, and remifentanil and after endotracheal intubation.

      "# Abstract We evaluated the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents (6--17 years) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week study in Japan. Patients received flexibly dosed aripiprazole (1--15 mg/day) or placebo. Ninety-two patients were randomized to placebo (n = 45) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8. Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8. All patients randomized to aripiprazole completed the study, and no serious adverse events were reported. Three patients in placebo group discontinued. Aripiprazole was effective and generally safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of irritability associated with ASD in Japanese children and adolescents. # Results ## Subject Disposition and Demographics In total, 99 patients were enrolled and 92 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 45) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Forty-two (93.3%) patients in the placebo group and 47 (100%) patients in the aripiprazole group completed the trial; subject disposition is shown in Fig.  [1](#) . All randomized patients (n = 92) were included the efficacy and safety sample. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Subject disposition</figcaption> </figure> The demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline are shown in Table  [1](#) . The mean age of the randomized patients was 10.1 years old, and the majority of patients were males and younger than 13 years.

Antiparkinson agents were not used by any enrolled patients during the study period. ## Efficacy Outcomes Table  [2](#) shows the results for primary and secondary endpoints. At week 8, the least square mean decrease from baseline in the parent/caregiver-rated ABC-J irritability subscale score was significantly greater for patients who received aripiprazole (Table  [2](#) ; Fig.  [3](#) ). The TD was −3.94 showing statistical significance (Table  [2](#) ). Significant TDs in favor of aripiprazole were detected from week 3 through week 8 (Fig.  [3](#) ). At week 8, aripiprazole group showed a statistically significant improvement in mean clinician-rated CGI-I scores greater than the placebo group [2.7 (0.1) vs 3.4 (0.1); TD: −0.62 (95% CI: −1.02 to − 0.22); p = 0.003]. Significant TDs in favor of aripiprazole were observed from week 2 through week 8 (Fig.  [4](#) ). Response rates were significantly greater for patients who received aripiprazole from week 3 through week 8 (Table  [2](#) ; Fig.  [5](#) ). Patients who received aripiprazole demonstrated significant improvement versus placebo on the mean ABC-J hyperactivity subscale score. Subjects treated with aripiprazole demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in the mean CGI-S score from week 2 through week 8 and the CGAS score at weeks 4 and 8. There was no significant difference between aripiprazole group and the placebo group in the mean ABC-J stereotypy, inappropriate speech and lethargy/social withdrawal subscale scores, as well as ABC-J response rate, CY-BOCS (compulsion scale) (Table  [2](#) ). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "Data are expressed as number (%):::: EPS-related AEs were found in 1 (2.2%) patient in the placebo group and in 3 (6.4%) patients in the aripiprazole group. In the aripiprazole group, EPS-related AEs were observed in 2 (4.3%) patients (salivary hypersecretion) or 1 (2.1%) patient each (akathisia, gait disturbance, bradykinesia, lisp and tremor). One patient in the aripiprazole group experienced salivary hypersecretion, gait disturbance, bradykinesia, lisp and tremor. One (2.2%) patient in the placebo group experienced salivary hypersecretion as EPS. The severity of all observed EPS-related AEs were considered mild in both groups. Mean serum prolactin concentrations at baseline were 16.7 ng/mL for placebo and 14.3 ng/mL for aripiprazole. Aripiprazole was associated with a significant decrease in serum prolactin concentrations compared with placebo from baseline to week 8 (−13.8 vs −2.0 ng/mL; p < 0.001). No patient in the aripiprazole group experienced increase in serum prolactin concentrations. Sedation was reported as an AE in 2.1% (n = 1) of the aripiprazole group and no patients in the placebo group. Increased appetite was reported as an AE in 4.3% (n = 2) of the aripiprazole group and 2.2% (n = 1) in the placebo group. Weight gain was reported as an AE in 2.2% (n = 1) of the placebo group and no patients in the aripiprazole group. An increase in body weight of ≥7% from baseline was seen in 6.7% of the placebo group and 27.7% of the aripiprazole group. However, the mean change in weight from baseline to week 8 was not significantly different between aripiprazole and placebo (1.24 vs 0.58 kg; p = 0.085). The mean change in BMI from baseline to week 8 was significantly different between aripiprazole and placebo (0.40 versus 0.03 kg/m ^2^ ; p = 0.035). After treatment, the incidence rates of total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dL were: placebo, 9.1% and aripiprazole, 17.0%. No patients experienced fasting blood glucose ≥115 mg/dL, non-fasting blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL, fasting triglyceride ≥200 mg/dL, non-fasting triglyceride ≥500 mg/dL. No marked abnormalities were observed in the other clinical laboratory tests along with vital sign assessments and the 12-lead ECG, except for the decrease in serum prolactin concentrations in the aripiprazole group as described above. There were no adverse events regarding treatment-related suicidal ideation and behavior during the treatment phase.\n",
      "# Abstract Most patients with fibromyalgia use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Properly designed controlled trials are necessary to assess the effectiveness of these practices. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, early phase trial. Fifty patients seen at a fibromyalgia outpatient treatment program were randomly assigned to a daily soy or placebo (casein) shake. Outcome measures were scores of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention. Analysis was with standard statistics based on the null hypothesis, and separation test for early phase CAM comparative trials. Twenty-eight patients completed the study. Use of standard statistics with intent-to-treat analysis showed that total FIQ scores decreased by 14% in the soy group (*P* = .02) and by 18% in the placebo group (*P* < .001). The difference in change in scores between the groups was not significant (*P* = .16). With the same analysis, CES-D scores decreased in the soy group by 16% (*P* = .004) and in the placebo group by 15% (*P* = .05). The change in scores was similar in the groups (*P* = .83). Results of statistical analysis using the separation test and intent-to-treat analysis revealed no benefit of soy compared with placebo. Shakes that contain soy and shakes that contain casein, when combined with a multidisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program, provide a decrease in fibromyalgia symptoms. Separation between the effects of soy and casein (control) shakes did not favor the intervention. Therefore, large-sample studies using soy for patients with fibromyalgia are probably not indicated. # 3. Results ## 3.1. Baseline Characteristics A total of 50 patients (49 women) were recruited for this trial. Median age was 47.7 years (range, 18--76 years). There was no significant difference in age (*P* = .99), FIQ scores (*P* = .36) or CES-D scores (*P* = .48) between the two groups. Twenty-eight patients (56%)---12 in the soy group and 16 in the placebo group (*P* = .39)---completed the 6-week trial. Reasons for not completing it are depicted in [Figure 1](#). Patients who did not finish the trial were significantly younger (median age, 39.8 years) than those who finished it (median age, 53.9 years) (*P* < .001). The median FIQ score was higher for patients who did not complete the trial (59.5) than for those who completed the study (54.8), but the difference was not statistically significant (*P* = .12). The median CES-D score also was higher for patients who did not complete the trial (26.5) than for patients who completed the trial (14.0), but this also was not a statistically significant difference (*P* = .14). ## 3.2. Between-Group Comparisons With intent-to-treat analysis, the total FIQ scores determined at study entry and at study completion decreased 14% (±29) in the soy group and 18% (±25) in the placebo group (*P* = .16). With per-protocol analysis, the total FIQ scores decreased 29% (±36) in the soy group and 28% (±26) in the placebo group (*P* = .93) ([Figure 2](#)). No statistically significant decrease between the soy group and the placebo group was observed for any of the FIQ subclass scores. With intent-to-treat analysis, the CES-D scores improved 16% (±26) in the soy group and 15% (±41) in the placebo group (*P* = .83); with per-protocol analysis, the CES-D scores improved 33% (±30) in the soy group and 24% (±50) in the placebo group ([Figure 3](#)). However, the decrease between the groups was not statistically significant (*P* = .96). Using various cutoff points for depression (CES-D ≥ 16, CES-D ≥ 19 and CES-D ≥ 27) and intent-to-treat analysis, we found a depression rate of 52%, 48% and 28%, respectively, in the soy group and 52%, 48% and 32% in the control group at study entry. After 6 weeks, these percentages were 48%, 44% and 24% in the treatment group and 48%, 36% and 24% in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups (*P* = 1.00). Determined by using per-protocol analysis for these three different CES-D scores, the percentages of patients with depression at study entry in the treatment group were 42%, 33% and 8% and in the control group were 38%, 38% and 19%. After 6 weeks, 33% of the treatment group had CES-D scores of 16 or greater, 25% had scores of 19 or greater and 0% had scores of 27 or greater. The percentages for the control group were 31%, 19% and 6%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. The separation test using the difference from baseline to 6 weeks showed no benefit for soy, as determined by FIQ scores and CES-D scores for both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. We did not have enough information to make any recommendation for or against the use of soy using the separation test per-protocol analysis based on total FIQ scores ([Table 1](#)). ## 3.3. Within-Group Comparisons Significant, but modest, improvement in total FIQ scores (soy group, *P* = .02; placebo group, *P* < .001) ([Figure 2](#)) and CES-D scores (soy group, *P* = .004; placebo group, *P* = .05) ([Figure 3](#)) between study entry and study completion was seen in both groups. Using three different cutoff points for depression (CES-D ≥ 16, CES-D ≥ 19 and CES-D ≥ 27), we found no significant improvement using the McNemar test for the soy and control groups (*P* > .50). ### 3.3.1. FIQ Subclass Scores The average score of answers to questions 1 through 11 showed no significant improvement from before treatment to after treatment in both groups, as did the average score of answers to questions 12 and 13. However, the average score of answers to questions 14 through 20 showed significant improvement from before treatment to after treatment in the soy group (*P* = .004) and the placebo group (*P* = .001). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow chart of patients in the placebo-controlled soy supplement trial.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Total FIQ scores of patients in soy supplement trial, with intent-to-treat analysis (A–D) and per–protocol analysis (E–H).

      "# Abstract ## Background The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Nd:YAG laser irradiation following casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) application on calcium and phosphate concentration and surface microhardness (SMH) of enamel surface in artificial white spot lesions of primary teeth. ## Material and Methods Eighty teeth with artificial white spot lesions were randomly divided into four groups: (A) distilled and deionized water, (B) Nd:YAG laser, (C) CPP-ACP crème, & (D) CPP-ACP plus laser. SMH was measured using Vickers diamond indenter in Vickers Hardness Number (VHN). Two samples of each group were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results were analyzed with the SPSS 17/win. ## Results The subjects of group D demonstrated a significant increase in the calcium and phosphate contents of enamel surface compared to those of groups A (P < 0.001, P < 0.001), B (P < 0.001, P < 0.001) and C (P = 0.024, P = 0.04), respectively. A statistically significant difference was seen for mean VHN between groups A and B (P = 0.002). SEM evaluations confirmed the results. ## Conclusions The combination of Nd:YAG laser and CPP-ACP crème could be recommended as an effective preventive modality for remineralizing of white spot lesions in primary teeth. **Key words:**CPP-ACP, enamel remineralization, microhardness, Nd:YAG, primary teeth, SEM. # Results -Total weight percentage of calcium, phosphate and enamel surface micro hardness The mean enamel VHN and total weight percentage of calcium and phosphate, resulting from the EDX analysis of enamel surface in treatment groups are given in [ Table 1](#). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "![]():::: Mean total weight percentage of calcium was higher in group D compared to other groups ([ Table 1](#)). Also mean total weight percentage of phosphate was higher in group D compared to other groups. The difference in the mean values were statistically significant between groups A and D and also between groups A and C, while the difference was not significant between groups A and B ([ Table 1](#)). The highest mean VHN was recorded in group C ([ Table 1](#)). The results showed a statistically significant difference in the mean values of VHN between groups A and B, while the difference was not significant between groups A and other groups. Mean VHN in groups D and C were significantly higher than that in group B; meanwhile, this difference was not significant between groups D and C the p values are listed in [ Table 1](#). -SEM micrograph findings Figure [1](#)a shows a sound enamel surface from the negative control group demonstrating relatively smooth area with frequent enamel prism ends present on the surface. The surface presented shallow depressions and fine porosities within these depressions. The enamel surfaces were devoid of any surface deposits. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>a) SEM image of control group showing enamel surface. b) SEM image of enamel surface irradiated with Nd:YAG laser showing melted enamel (large arrow) and fine cracks (small arrow). c) SEM image of enamel surface treated with CPP-ACP showing granular particles and amorphous crystals (arrow). d) SEM image of enamel surface treated with combined application of CPP-ACP and laser showing smooth and more homogeneous lazed surface (large arrow) with a few cracks coating by granular and globular particles and amorphous homogenous crystals (small arrow).</figcaption> </figure> The SEM image of enamel irradiated with Nd:YAG laser (group B) showed an irregular roughened surface (Fig. [1](#)b). In this group, typical melting appearance with occasional areas of fine surface cracking, discontinuities, coalescence of globules and holes could be observed. The surface was peppered with cavitations and craters leading to an irregular undulated surface. The surface did not show any of the usual enamel prism ends seen in the control group. Numerous cracked surface coatings covered almost the entire surface. In the SEM image of the enamel surface treated with CPP-ACP (group C), numerous granular particles and amorphous crystals were arranged on the enamel surface, those crystals seemed to be homogeneous, and there was no obvious intercrystalline space (Fig. [1](#)c). In the CPP-ACP plus laser samples (group D), a relatively smooth, more homogeneous surface compared to those in the groups treated with laser and CPP-ACP alone were noted (Fig. [1](#)d). Fewer cracks were observed on the glazed enamel surface, probably due to the application of CPP-ACP before laser irradiation, consistent with the numerous occurrences of granular and globular particles and amorphous homogenous crystals arranged on the enamel surface.\n",
      "# Abstract # ABSTRACT ## Objective The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel- arm randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* SP1-containing probiotic sachet and azithromycin tablets as an adjunct to nonsurgical therapy in clinical parameters and in presence and levels of *Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis* and *Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.* ## Material and Methods Forty-seven systemically healthy volunteers with chronic periodontitis were recruited and monitored clinically and microbiologically at baseline for 3, 6 and 9 months after therapy. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from four periodontal sites with clinical attachment level ≥1 mm, probing pocket depth ≥4 mm and bleeding on probing, one site in each quadrant. Samples were cultivated and processed using the PCR technique. Patients received nonsurgical therapy including scaling and root planing (SRP) and were randomly assigned to a probiotic (n=16), antibiotic (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15) group. *L. rhamnosus* SP1 was taken once a day for 3 months. Azithromycin 500mg was taken once a day for 5 days. ## Results All groups showed improvements in clinical and microbiological parameters at all time points evaluated. Probiotic and antibiotic groups showed greater reductions in cultivable microbiota compared with baseline. The placebo group showed greater reduction in number of subjects with *P. gingivalis* compared with baseline. However, there were no significant differences between groups. ## Conclusions The adjunctive use of *L. rhamnosus* SP1 sachets and azithromycin during initial therapy resulted in similar clinical and microbiological improvements compared with the placebo group. # Results The flow chart of the study is shown in [Figure 1](#). Forty-seven patients, 16 in the probiotic group, 16 in the antibiotic group and 15 in the placebo group were analyzed. All patients entering the study also completed it. No compliance problems were noted, all patients followed the protocol of the study. Only one subject from the antibiotic group reported an adverse event (nausea). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flowchart of the study design</figcaption> </figure> ## Intergroup analysis At baseline, no significant differences in demographic, medical and clinical characteristics were found between groups (p>0.05, [Table 1](#)). Also, there were no intergroup differences in CAL, PPD, BOP, plaque accumulation, total cultivable microbiota and percentages of *P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans* and *T. forsythia* at 3, 6, and 9 months follow-up ([Table 2](#) and [3](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

In the probiotic group we observed a significant reduction of the clinical attachment loss at 3 and 9 months and of the PPD and plaque accumulation at all times of the follow-up. In the antibiotic group, we perceived a significant reduction of the CAL and BOP at 3 and 6 months, as well as a significant reduction of the PPD and plaque accumulation at all times of the follow-up. Finally, in the placebo group, the CAL, PPD and plaque accumulation decreased significantly at all times and the BOP at 3 and 6 months. Also, we observed a variation of the total cultivable microbiota, as seen in [Table 2](#). Compared with baseline, there was a significant reduction in the probiotic group at 6-month follow-up, while for the antibiotic group it occurred at all times (p<0.017). In [Table 3](#), we analyzed the variation of the microbiological variables between the basal time and the 9-month follow-up. Percentage of *T. forsythia* and *A. actinomycetemcomitans* is not reported, because the development of these microorganisms was not observed at any time of the analysis.

      "# Abstract ## OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of occupational noise on sound localization in different spatial planes and frequencies among normal hearing firefighters. ## METHOD: A total of 29 adults with pure-tone hearing thresholds below 25 dB took part in the study. The participants were divided into a group of 19 firefighters exposed to occupational noise and a control group of 10 adults who were not exposed to such noise. All subjects were assigned a sound localization task involving 117 stimuli from 13 sound sources that were spatially distributed in horizontal, vertical, midsagittal and transverse planes. The three stimuli, which were square waves with fundamental frequencies of 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz, were presented at a sound level of 70 dB and were randomly repeated three times from each sound source. The angle between the speaker's axis in the same plane was 45°, and the distance to the subject was 1 m. ## RESULT: The results demonstrate that the sound localization ability of the firefighters was significantly lower (*p*<0.01) than that of the control group. ## CONCLUSION: Exposure to occupational noise, even when not resulting in hearing loss, may lead to a diminished ability to locate a sound source. # RESULTS The results were obtained from a cohort of fifteen men and four women (n = 19). The test subjects' ages ranged from 23 to 41 years (mean = 31.4 with a standard deviation of 5.5 years, and the 10^th^ and 90^th^ percentiles were 23 and 40 years, respectively). The control group ages ranged between 20 and 45 years (mean = 29.6 with a standard deviation of 6.2 years). Correct sound source localization by the normal hearing firefighters is depicted in [Figure 1](#). A higher percentage of correct responses was observed in the horizontal plane, followed by the frontal and vertical planes, where the numbers of correct answers were equal. Utilization of the ANOVA and Tukey's tests, however, demonstrated that the percentage of correct sound localization responses was statistically significant in the horizontal plane (*p* = 0.01). Conversely, those in the frontal plane were not statistically identical to the vertical plane (*p* = 0.03). The responses between the frontal and vertical planes were only equal with regards to the mean. [Figure 2](#) presents the firefighters responses in relation to the frequencies used. Very similar values were observed, and the mean percentages of correct answer for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies were 31.9%, 30.4% and 28.07%, respectively. Differences between the frequencies, as determined by the ANOVA and Tukey tests, were not statistically significant ([Table 1](#)). A comparison between the results obtained from the firefighter group and the control group is illustrated in [Figure 3](#). The numbers of correct responses, by spatial plane, between the control and test groups were significantly different (with *p*-values less than 0.01, after applying the Student's t-test). [Figure 4](#) compares the mean correct responses between the control and test groups according to the stimulus frequency. The control group obtained means that were 24%, 21% and 25% higher than those of the test group for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies, respectively. A comparison of the responses between the groups revealed that the number of correct responses was greater in the control group at all frequencies (*p*-values were less than 0.01 using the Student's t-test). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>A comparison of the average percentage of correct sound localization responses for each plane.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>A comparison of the average percentage of success (correct responses) among the frequencies.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>A comparison of the average percentage of success between the groups according to plane.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>A comparison of the average percentage of success between the groups according to frequency.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background and Objectives This trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the Genoss drug-eluting coronary stent. ## Methods This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial with a 1:1 ratio of Genoss drug-eluting stent (DES)™ and Promus Element™. Inclusion criteria were the presence of stable angina, unstable angina, or silent ischemia. Angiographic inclusion criteria were de novo coronary stenotic lesion with diameter stenosis >50%, reference vessel diameter of 2.5--4.0 mm, and lesion length ≤40 mm. The primary endpoint was in-stent late lumen loss at 9-month quantitative coronary angiography follow-up. Secondary endpoints were in-segment late lumen loss, binary restenosis rate, death, myocardial infarction (MI), target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), and stent thrombosis during 9 months of follow-up. ## Results We enrolled 38 patients for the Genoss DES™ group and 39 patients for the Promus Element™ group. In-stent late lumen loss at 9 months was not significantly different between the 2 groups (0.11±0.25 vs. 0.16±0.43 mm, p=0.567). There was no MI or stent thrombosis in either group. The rates of death (2.6% vs. 0%, p=0.494), TLR (2.6% vs. 2.6%, p=1.000), and TVR (7.9% vs. 2.6%, p=0.358) at 9 months were not significantly different. ## Conclusion This first-in-patient study of the Genoss DES™ stent showed excellent angiographic outcomes for in-stent late lumen loss and major adverse cardiac events over a 9-month follow-up. # RESULTS Between March 2013 and April 2015, 85 patients were screened for enrollment in the study. Five patients did not meet inclusion criteria and a total of 80 patients were randomly assigned to the Genoss DES™ or Promus Element™ group at a 1:1 ratio. In the Genoss DES™ group, 2 patients were excluded as one patient did not receive stent implantation and the other patient had a protocol violation. In the Promus Element™ group, 1 patient was excluded owing to the patient's withdrawal from the study ([Figure 1](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow chart of patient enrollment.<br /> DES = drug-eluting stent.</figcaption> </figure> Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics are shown in [Tables 1](#) and [2](#), respectively. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics including age and clinical diagnosis between the 2 groups ([Table 1](#)). Target vessels were not significantly different, but the left anterior descending artery was targeted more often in the Promus Element™ group. Stent overlap was performed in 8 (21.1%) patients in the Genoss DES™ group and in 3 (7.7%) patients in the Promus Element™ group ([Table 2](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Purpose Sonic hedgehog (SHH), an activating ligand of smoothened (SMO), is overexpressed in > 70% of pancreatic cancers (PCs). We investigated the impact of vismodegib, an SHH antagonist, plus gemcitabine (GV) or gemcitabine plus placebo (GP) in a multicenter phase Ib/randomized phase II trial and preclinical PC models. ## Patients and Methods Patients with PC not amenable to curative therapy who had received no prior therapy for metastatic disease and had Karnofsky performance score ≥ 80 were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to GV or GP. The primary end point was progression-free-survival (PFS). Exploratory correlative studies included serial SHH serum levels and contrast perfusion computed tomography imaging. To further investigate putative biologic mechanisms of SMO inhibition, two autochthonous pancreatic cancer models (Kras^G12D^; p16/p19^fl/fl^; Pdx1-Cre and Kras^G12D^; p53^R270H/wt^; Pdx1-Cre) were studied. ## Results No safety issues were identified in the phase Ib portion (n = 7), and the phase II study enrolled 106 evaluable patients (n = 53 in each arm). Median PFS was 4.0 and 2.5 months for GV and GP arms, respectively (95% CI, 2.5 to 5.3 and 1.9 to 3.8, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.21; *P* = .30). Median overall survival (OS) was 6.9 and 6.1 months for GV and GP arms, respectively (95% CI, 5.8 to 8.0 and 5.0 to 8.0, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.58; *P* = .84). Response rates were not significantly different. There were no significant associations between correlative markers and overall response rate, PFS, or OS. Preclinical trials revealed no significant differences with vismodegib in drug delivery, tumor growth rate, or OS in either model. ## Conclusion The addition of vismodegib to gemcitabine in an unselected cohort did not improve overall response rate, PFS, or OS in patients with metastatic PC. Our preclinical and clinical results revealed no statistically significant differences with respect to drug delivery or treatment efficacy using vismodegib. # RESULTS ## Clinical Trial ### Patient characteristics. Seven patients were enrolled onto the phase Ib open-label GV portion, and no safety issues were identified. For the randomized phase II part of the trial, 111 patients were enrolled at 13 sites between February 2010 and June 2012, stratified by Karnofsky performance score (80 *v* 90 or 100) and disease status (newly diagnosed *v* recurrent; [Fig 1](#)). Of these, four patients withdrew consent before starting treatment (two from each arm), and one patient (randomly assigned to GV) was subsequently found to have been ineligible and never started therapy. Analyses were based on the remaining 106 patients. Patient characteristics were similar between treatment arms, except for the incidence of peritoneal metastases, which were higher in the GP arm (9% *v* 23%; [Table 1](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>CONSORT diagram of clinical trial enrollment and treatment in phase II trial. gem, gemcitabine.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

ORRs were similar in the two arms (GV: complete response [CR], 0 [0%]; partial response [PR], 4 [8%]; stable disease [SD], 27 [51%]; disease control [ie, CR + PR + SD], 31 [58%]; GP: CR, 1 [2%]; PR, 6 [11%]; SD, 20 [38%]; disease control, 27 [51%]). The difference in response rates (8% *v* 13%) was not significant (*P* = .53; Data Supplement). The primary end point of the study was PFS. At the final analysis, events (progression or death) occurred in 48 patients (91%) receiving GV and 51 (95%) receiving GP. Median PFS was 4.0 months for GV and 2.5 months for GP (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.23; [Fig 2](#)A; Data Supplement). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>(A) Progression-free and (B) overall survival by treatment arm.

No survival differences were noted in a preplanned secondary analysis of OS that censored patients receiving GP at first progression, before crossover to GV (*P* = .69). Note that patient crossover did not affect the primary end point (ie, PFS), because crossover happened after the event occurred. For patients receiving GP who crossed over at progression (n = 22 [42%]), median PFS was 1.8 months, and median OS was 2.9 months (Data Supplement). One-year survival rates in the GV and GP arms were 15% and 25%, respectively (*P* = .3). OS and PFS did not differ significantly by Karnofsky performance score (*P* = .66 and .42, respectively; Data Supplement). Mortality and disease progression rates were consistent and uniformly high across all centers. ## Clinical Trial Correlative Results ### SHH serum levels. Median pretreatment plasma SHH level pooled for both treatment arms was 1.01 ng/mL (GV arm, 1.01 ng/mL; GP arm, 1.06 ng/mL). SHH levels did not change significantly with subsequent cycles (*P* = .087), nor was there a difference between treatment groups (*P* = .85) or patients with cancer (n = 89) and normal controls (n = 40; *P* = .4) ([Figs 3](#)A and [3](#)B). SHH serum levels did not correlate with age in either patients with cancer (*r* = 0.17; *P* = .13) or controls (*r* = 0.03; *P* = .87; [Figs 3](#)C and [3](#)D). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Clinical trial translational correlatives.

Previous preclinical studies have suggested that SHH is abnormally expressed in genetically engineered models of PC.^[29](#),[37](#)^ SHH expression and pathway activation were confirmed in the KPP genetically engineered mouse model of PC by transcriptional gene analysis and immunohistochemistry. SHH immunoreactivity exhibited focal staining throughout tumors, predominantly in mucinous and well-defined ductal epithelial cells (data not shown), consistent with previous reports.^[26](#)^ Comparative transcriptional analysis of normal pancreas and tumor revealed significantly elevated expression of Hh ligands *SHH* and Indian Hh (*IHH*), as well as *SMO*, glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 1 (*GLI1*), *GLI2*, Hh Interacting Protein (*HHIP*), and *PTCH*1 (Data Supplement). To determine whether inhibition of SMO leads to changes in tumor stroma, we used a small molecule, HhAntag,^[38](#)^ a potent orally available preclinical surrogate of the US Food and Drug Administration--approved vismodegib (GDC-0449).^[10](#)^ Previous reports have shown that antagonism of Hh signaling resulted in increased mean microvessel density (MVD).^[29](#)^ HhAntag treatment on tumor-bearing KPP animals revealed no significant change in MVD ([Fig 4](#)A; *P* = .54; Data Supplement), despite observing pathway inhibition (Data Supplement). Moreover, HhAntag treatment did not affect intratumoral extracellular matrix deposition assessed through trichrome staining ([Fig 4](#)B; *P* = .29). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Effects of hedgehog pathway antagonism (HhAntag) on vasculature, stromal content, and intratumoral gemcitabine metabolites in Kras<sup>G12D</sup>; p16/p19<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Pdx1-Cre (KPP) tumors.

NS, not significant.</figcaption> </figure> ### SMO inhibition does not affect gemcitabine drug delivery in vivo. The modest response rates observed in patients with PC treated with gemcitabine has, in part, been attributed to poor drug delivery associated with a prohibitive tumor microenvironment. Gemcitabine undergoes intracellular conversion, from 2′,2′-difluoro 2′-deoxycytidine (dFdC) to the active triphosphate form 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP), responsible for inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. To directly measure drug delivery, dFdCTP levels were analyzed in PC tumors of KPP mice after continuous 10-day HhAntag treatment and a single dose of gemcitabine. Liquid chromatography--tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that dFdCTP concentrations were similar in both vehicle- and HhAntag-treated KPP mice ([Fig 4](#)C; Mann-Whitney *P* = 1.00). Intracellular gemcitabine is also converted to an inactivated form, diflurodeoxyuridine (dFdU). The ratio of the unprocessed form (dFdC) to inactive form (dFdU) estimates intratumoral gemcitabine exposure. The average ratio of dFdC to dFdU in KPP tumors of HhAntag-treated mice was not significantly different between vehicle and SMO inhibitor groups ([Fig 4](#)D; *P* = .48). Together, these results indicated that HhAntag did not increase gemcitabine delivery in this genetically engineered PC mouse model. ### Pancreatic tumor progression and OS remain unaltered by Hh pathway inhibition. Next, we investigated the therapeutic impact of HhAntag in KPP mice. Growth rates of tumors, as determined by serial ultrasound imaging, were not significantly different when comparing HhAntag and vehicle arms, indicating no single-agent effect of Hh pathway inhibition ([Figs 5](#)A and [5](#)B). Although the combination of gemcitabine plus HhAntag significantly decreased tumor growth relative to control treatment (log-rank *P* = .0052), the growth rate was not different from that of gemcitabine alone, known to affect tumor growth in this model.^[39](#)^ Consistent with the lack of tumor growth effect, the HhAntag plus gemcitabine combination did not provide significant improvement in OS when compared with gemcitabine alone ([Fig 5](#)C). In summary, the addition of HhAntag did not affect tumor growth or animal longevity in the KPP model. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Smoothened (SMO) inhibitor does not affect tumor progression or overall survival in Kras <sup>LSL-G12D</sup>; p16/p19 <sup>fl/fl</sup>; Pdx1-Cre (KPP) mice.

HhAntag, hedgehog pathway antagonism.</figcaption> </figure> ### Analysis of SMO inhibition in KR mice. Although the KPP model represents the genetics of a subset of the PC population, previous findings were generated in a model composed of mutant *KRAS* and mutant *p53* expression in the pancreas.^[40](#)^ Therefore, we reproduced all in vivo studies in the KR model. HhAntag treatment on tumor-bearing KR animals revealed a significant decrease in MVD using meca-32 (Data Supplement; *P* = .0418) and trend toward decrease using CD31 (Data Supplement; *P* = .29). Trichrome staining revealed no significant changes to the stroma of HhAntag-treated tumors (Data Supplement; *P* = .83). Together these findings indicated that as in the previous KPP model, the stroma of the developed KR tumors was not significantly affected by HhAntag treatment. Finally, we observed no significant change in concentration of the gemcitabine metabolite dFdCTP in tumors after HhAntag (Data Supplement; *P* = .25) and no significant change in the ratio of dFdC to dFdU (Data Supplement). Furthermore, neither HhAntag nor the gemcitabine plus HhAntag combination affected tumor growth rates in KR animals compared with gemcitabine alone (Data Supplement). Consistent with the tumor growth study, HhAntag did not lead to survival benefit over vehicle or gemcitabine treatment (Data Supplement). Taken together, neither of the murine PC model genotypes (KPP or KR) demonstrated any measurable differences between gemcitabine delivery to tumors, tumor growth rate, or OS with HhAntag treatment. A significant decrease in microvessel density, consistent with previous work in transplantable models using vismodegib, was observed.^[41](#)^\n",
      "# Abstract *Background*. In view of the adverse effects of using restraints, studies examining the use of restraint reduction programs (RRPs) are needed. *Objectives*. To investigate the effect of an RRP on the reduction of physical restraint rates in rehabilitation hospitals. *Methods*. A prospective quasi-experimental clinical trial was conducted. Demographic data, medical and health-related information on recruited patients from two rehabilitation hospitals, as well as facility data on restraint rates were collected. *Results*. The increase in the restraint rate in the control site was 4.3 times greater than that in the intervention site. Changes in the restraint mode, from continuous to intermittent, and the type of restraint used were found between the pre- and postintervention periods in both the control site and the intervention site. *Discussion*. Compared with that in the control site, the RRP in the intervention site helped arrest any increase in the restraint rate although it had no effect on physical restraint reduction. The shift of restraint mode from continuous to intermittent in the intervention site was one of the positive outcomes of the RRP. # 3. Results The samples in the two hospitals were first compared in terms of their demographic and clinical characteristics. The preintervention sample at the intervention facility was considerably older---mean age 75.4 (SD 10.7) versus 59.1 (SD 17.4) of the control facility (*P* < 0.001). The two samples were different in terms of the number of medical diagnosis, with the study site having a mean of 3.1 diagnoses (SD 1.5) versus the control site's mean of 1.8 diagnoses (SD 1.2) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MMSE score of the study site was 16.7 (SD 7.0) versus control site's 25.4 (SD 5.3) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MBI score was 12.7 (SD 5.5) in the study site versus control site's mean 15.1 score (SD 3.2) (*P* < 0.001). There were no significant differences found in all the other clinical and demographic variables. The postintervention sample at the study site remained considerably older, with a mean age of 74.8 (SD 10.6) versus 62.9 (SD 17.7) in the control site (*P* < 0.001). Again, the two samples were different in terms of the number of medical diagnosis, with the study site having a mean of 3.2 diagnoses (SD 1.5) versus control site's mean of 1.9 diagnoses (SD 1.2) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MMSE score of the study site was 16.4 (SD 7.2) versus control site's 24.4 (SD 6.5) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MBI score of the study site was 12.0 (SD 5.1) versus control site's mean 15.1 (SD 3.4) (*P* < 0.001). The two facilities were also significantly different in terms of their gender composition---49.0% males in the study site versus 34.8% males in the control site. No other significant differences were found in clinical and demographic variables between the two hospital samples in the post-intervention period. Then the baseline sample profile of the patients before the intervention in the study and control site were compared (Tables [1](#)(a) and [1](#)(b)). The control site had a significantly younger patient group than the study site (*P* < 0.001) in the nonrestrained patient group. This younger patient group probably resulted in the higher cognitive status as reflected in the significantly higher mean MMSE total score (*P* < 0.001) and the lower risk of fall as reflected in the lower Morse Fall Scale score (*P* < 0.001) ([Table 1(a)](#)). Restrained patients had a similar sample profile in both the study and control sites. However, significant differences were found in age (*P* < 0.01) in both the nonrestrained and restrained groups of patients between the study and control sites. A significant difference in the experiences of falling in hospital (*P* < 0.01) was also found in the nonrestrained patients ([Table 1(b)](#)). Last, the profiles of those who were restrained and nonrestrained were compared in each of the study sites. Tables [2](#)(a) and [2](#)(b) provide information about the categorical variables of the samples recruited during the pre- and postintervention period in both sites. Significant differences were found in the MBI score (*P* = 0.016) and vision (*P* < 0.001) in the study site in the postintervention period when compared with the preintervention period. The mean MBI score was worse (30.3 versus 31.5) while there were more people with normal vision (39.2% versus 51.2%) after intervention. For the control site, there were significant differences in the age (*P* = 0.039) and the Morse fall scale (*P* < 0.001) in the postintervention when compared with the pre-intervention phase. The mean age was older (59.1 versus 62.9) and the mean MFS score (20.7 versus 30.3) showed a slightly higher risk post-intervention. To answer the primary research question of whether a reduction in restraint rates had been attained in the post-intervention period, the prevalence of restraint was calculated. In the control site, the overall restraint rate (including both intermittent and continuous) significantly increased from 2.6 to 8.3% (*P* < 0.000). Both intermittent and continuous use of restraint were significantly increased in the postintervention period, with intermittent restraint use increasing from 0.2 to 3.3% (*P* < 0.001) and continuous restraint use increasing from 2.4 to 5% (*P* < 0.001) ([Table 3](#)). In the study site, there was no significant difference in the overall restraint rate between the pre- and postintervention periods although the overall restraint rate had a slightly upward trend from 11.5% to 13.6% (*P* = 0.405) postintervention. There was a significant increase in the use of intermittent restraint, from 0.7 to 5.1% (*P* < 0.001), but a significant decrease of continuous restraint from 10.8 to 8.5% (*P* < 0.001) ([Table 3](#)) was also recorded. We analyzed the subsample recruited into the RRC (those complex cases who were brought to the multidisciplinary team for discussion about their progress). In this subsample, we found that there was a significant increase of patients with their restraints taken off after RRC conference (0% versus 18.2%, *P* = 0.014). There was an insignificant but slight increase of intermittent restraint (from 14.5% to 18.2%, *P* = 0.317), and there was a significant decrease of continuous restraint after RRC conference (from 85.5% to 63.6%, *P* = 0.009). These data provided further evidence that there was a positive direction of changes in practice in the intervention site. There was a significant increase in the use of bedrails and lap tables and a significant decrease in the use of waist belts and jackets after intervention in the control site. The bed rail was the most common type of restraint (61.9%), followed by the jacket restraint and waist belt (both at 14.3%), with lap tables as the least common (9.5%) after intervention. In the study site, there was a decrease in the use of lap tables (from 48.0% to 39.2%) after intervention, but at the same time, there was an increase in the use of bed rails (43.3% to 51.8%) at the study site ([Table 2(b)](#)). Bed rail was the most common type of restraint, followed by lap table (39.2%) and jacket restraint (8.6%) in the postintervention period. Because any increase or decrease in physical restraint use may imply a concomitant change in the use of chemical restraint, the subjects' use of psychotropic medications were also examined. No significant differences were found in the use of psychotropic medications in the study site (*P* = 0.346) and the control site (*P* = 0.075) comparing pre- and postintervention data. Both sites had a low rate in the use of psychotropic drugs to begin with and remained as such after intervention. In the study site, only 3.3% of the subjects were prescribed psychotropic medications before intervention, and 2.3% were prescribed psychotropic drugs after intervention. In the control site, 2% of the subjects were on psychotropic medications, and none were prescribed (0%) after intervention. The staff profiles were examined to see if there might be the possibility of impacting on the study outcomes. In the intervention site, the staff response rate in the preintervention survey was 82.2% (*N* = 97) and 77.4% after intervention (*N* = 89). No significant differences were found in their gender (*P* = 0.535), years of clinical experience (*P* = 0.684), with or without on-the-job training about restraint use (*P* = 0.179) pre- and post-intervention. Also, no significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (*P* = 0.147), attitude (*P* = 0.071), and practice (*P* = 0.139) before and after intervention using Janelli et al.'s (1991) validated questionnaire. When further analysis were conducted, a subsample of nurses (of one unit) were found to have better knowledge after intervention (mean score results: 5.51 versus 6.23, *P* = 0.04). In the control site, the staff response rate before intervention was 51.5% (*N* = 17) and 77.8% after intervention (*N* = 28). No significant differences were found in their gender (*P* = 0.431), years of clinical experience (*P* = 0.516), and with or without on the job training about restraint use (*P* = 0.948). Moreover, no significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (*P* = 0.436) and attitude (*P* = 0.498). There was, however, a significant decrease in their practice score (from 38.41 to 36.43, *P* = 0.048). The problematic practice behaviors included item C7 (I tell family members why the patient is being restrained), C8 (I explain to the patient why the restraint is being applied), and C9 (I tell the patient when the restraint will be removed). When comparing nursing staff samples of between the study and control sites, there were no significant differences observed in their gender distribution (before intervention: *P* = 0.279 and after intervention: *P* = 0.348), years of clinical experience (before intervention: *P* = 0.369; after intervention: *P* = 0.055), and with or without on the job training about restraint use (before intervention: *P* = 0.153; after intervention: *P* = 0.176). No significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (*P* = 0.230) and attitude (*P* = 0.986). However, there was a significant difference in their mean practice score (38.41 versus 36.43, *P* = 0.037), with the control site having relatively poorer scores. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## OBJECTIVE After intensive insulin treatment, many obese African American patients with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hyperglycemia are able to achieve near-normoglycemia remission. The optimal treatment to prevent hyperglycemic relapses after remission is not known. ## RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This prospective, 4-year, placebo-controlled study randomly assigned 48 African American subjects with DKA and severe hyperglycemia to metformin 1,000 mg daily (*n* = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg daily (*n* = 16), or placebo (*n* = 15) after normoglycemia remission. Hyperglycemic relapse was defined as fasting glucose >130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and HbA~1c~ >7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at randomization and at 3 months and then every 6 months for a median of 331 days. Oral minimal model and incremental area under the curve for insulin (AUCi) were used to calculate insulin sensitivity (Si) and β-cell function, respectively. Disposition index (DI) was calculated as a product of Si and incremental AUCi. ## RESULTS Relapse-free survival was higher in sitagliptin and metformin (*P* = 0.015) compared with placebo, and mean time to relapse was significantly prolonged in the metformin and sitagliptin groups compared with the placebo group (480 vs. 305 days, *P* = 0.004). The probability of relapse was significantly lower for metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10--0.81]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10--0.98]) than for placebo. Subjects who remained in remission had a higher DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) than those with hyperglycemia relapse without significant changes in Si. ## CONCLUSIONS This study shows that near-normoglycemia remission was similarly prolonged by treatment with sitagliptin and metformin. The prolongation of remission was due to improvement in β-cell function. # Results Forty-eight African American subjects with DKA (*n* = 22) and severe hyperglycemia (*n* = 26) were included in the study. Seventeen subjects were randomly assigned to metformin 1,000 mg daily, 16 to sitagliptin 100 mg daily, and 15 to placebo. Four subjects in the metformin group, 6 in the sitagliptin group, and 1 in the placebo group were lost to follow-up. One subject in the sitagliptin group and one subject in the placebo group withdrew from the study. The overall median follow-up after insulin discontinuation was 331 days (interquartile range 102, 612 days) with no differences between randomized groups ([Table 1](#)). The subjects lost to follow-up or who withdrew from the study were in near-normoglycemia remission during their last documented study visit. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics at presentation between subjects who withdrew and those who stayed in the study, except for HbA~1c~. HbA~1c~ was lower at presentation of DKA/hyperglycemia in subjects who withdrew compared with those who stayed (12.0 ± 2.3% [107 ± 25 mmol/mol] vs. 13.5 ± 2.0% [124 ± 22 mmol/mol], *P* = 0.03) but was similar at randomization. ::::table-wrap\n",

Because only a small number of subjects experienced relapse in the medication groups (metformin [*n* = 5], sitagliptin [*n* = 4]) compared with placebo (*n* = 11), we combined the metformin and sitagliptin groups. There were no significant differences in HbA~1c~ (8.0 ± 0.8% [64 ± 9 mmol/mol] vs. 8.2 ± 1.5% [66 ± 16 mmol/mol], *P* = 0.79) or blood glucose (152 ± 18 mg/dL [8.4 ± 1 mmol/L] vs. 160 ± 68 mg/dL [8.9 ± 3.8 mmol/L], *P* = 0.65) levels at the time of hyperglycemia relapse between the placebo group and the combined metformin and sitagliptin group. In the placebo group, 3 of the 11 subjects who experienced hyperglycemia relapse presented to the emergency department with a glucose level >400 mg/dL (22.2 mmol/mol) or DKA. None of the patients in the metformin and sitagliptin group had a hyperglycemia relapse necessitating a visit to the emergency department or admission to the hospital. The difference in hyperglycemia relapse was explained by improvements in β-cell function. Over the course of the study, DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) were significantly higher in subjects who remained in near-normoglycemia remission compared with those who had a hyperglycemia relapse without any differences in Si (*P* = 0.75). There was a significant interaction between remission status and study visit for both Si (*P* = 0.01) and DI (*P* = 0.02), suggesting a different pattern of change in Si and DI over time between subjects with near-normoglycemia remission and hyperglycemia relapse. The difference in DI and incremental AUCi was not present at randomization in the subjects who stayed in near-normoglycemia remission compared with those who experienced a hyperglycemia relapse ([Fig. 2*A* and *B*](#)). At the last documented follow-up, there were no differences in Si ([Fig. 2*C*](#)); however, DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) were significantly higher in subjects who stayed in near-normoglycemia remission than in those who had a hyperglycemia relapse at the end of the study ([Fig. 2*A* and *B*](#)). Comparison across treatment groups showed no differences at randomization, over the course of the study, or at the last follow-up for DI, incremental AUCi, or Si (data not shown). Similarly, a comparison of subjects with an initial presentation of DKA and severe hyperglycemia showed no differences in Si, incremental AUCi, or DI at randomization, over the course of the study, or at the last follow-up (data not shown). Although there were no significant changes in weight, we performed analyses adjusting for changes in weight throughout the course of the study.

      "# Abstract Deficits in social cognition including facial affect recognition and their detrimental effects on functional outcome are well established in schizophrenia. Structured training can have substantial effects on social cognitive measures including facial affect recognition. Elucidating training effects on cortical mechanisms involved in facial affect recognition may identify causes of dysfunctional facial affect recognition in schizophrenia and foster remediation strategies. In the present study, 57 schizophrenia patients were randomly assigned to (a) computer-based facial affect training that focused on affect discrimination and working memory in 20 daily 1-hour sessions, (b) similarly intense, targeted cognitive training on auditory-verbal discrimination and working memory, or (c) treatment as usual. Neuromagnetic activity was measured before and after training during a dynamic facial affect recognition task (5 s videos showing human faces gradually changing from neutral to fear or to happy expressions). Effects on 10--13 Hz (alpha) power during the transition from neutral to emotional expressions were assessed via MEG based on previous findings that alpha power increase is related to facial affect recognition and is smaller in schizophrenia than in healthy subjects. Targeted affect training improved overt performance on the training tasks. Moreover, alpha power increase during the dynamic facial affect recognition task was larger after affect training than after treatment-as-usual, though similar to that after targeted perceptual--cognitive training, indicating somewhat nonspecific benefits. Alpha power modulation was unrelated to general neuropsychological test performance, which improved in all groups. Results suggest that specific neural processes supporting facial affect recognition, evident in oscillatory phenomena, are modifiable. This should be considered when developing remediation strategies targeting social cognition in schizophrenia. # Results *Clinical status*improved in all three SZ groups independent of type of intervention: general function (GAF *F* (2,53) = 16.92, *p*  < .001), positive symptoms (PANSS-P *F* (2,53) = 17.92, *p*  < .001), and general symptoms (PANSS-G *F* (2,53) = 10.30, *p*  < .001; PANSS-N n.s.). There were no effects involving Intervention. ## MEG during FAR criterion task prior to intervention [Fig. 2](#)illustrates time--frequency representation (TFR) of power during face morphing prior to intervention. The HC19 group TFR showed an increase from baseline in the 10--13 Hz range between 1 s (morph onset) and 3.5 s after stimulus onset, with maximum around 3 s. This increase was not evident in any SZ group. Statistical comparisons ( [Fig. 2](#) , bottom) confirmed significant differences between HC19 and pre-intervention SZ in alpha-power increase over a central sensor cluster in the time course from 2.5 to 3.5 s after stimulus onset. *FAT task performance*was poorer in SZ during their first FAT session than in the HC24 group during their one FAT session (same-different task *F* (1,41) = 7.69, *p* = .008; blended emotion task *F* (1,41) = 8.24, *p* = .006; emotion sequence task *F* (1,41) = 16.11, *p*  < .001; emotion location task *F* (1,41) = 16.19, *p*  < .001; [Fig. 3](#) A). Performance improved with training on all four tasks in the FAT group, significantly in three tasks ( [Fig. 3B](#) , left): same/different, *F* (1,18) = 4.99, *p* = .04; blended emotion *F* (1,18) = 10.17, *p* = .005; emotion sequence *F* (1,18) = 3.28, *p* = .09; emotion location *F* (1,18) = 13.12, *p* = .002. In the last FAT training session, SZ no longer differed significantly from HC24 on three of the four tasks. SZ still performed worse in the emotion location task ( *F* (1,41) = 6.72, *p* = .01; see also effect sizes in [Fig. 3B](#) , right). ## FAT impact on MEG during FAR criterion task An Emotion × Time analysis of the FAT group produced a main effect of Time, *F* (1,18) = 5.61, *p* = .03 ( *p* = .02), reflecting a greater increase in alpha power from prestimulus baseline during the pre-recognition period of the FAR criterion task after training than before training ( [Fig. 4](#) , left). Here and below, no effects involving Emotion emerged. Pre-training, a Group (FAT pre-training vs. HC19) × Emotion analysis indicated smaller alpha power increase in SZ than in HC19 ( *F* (1,36) = 22.05, *p*  < .001; [Fig. 3](#) ). A similar comparison of FAT post-training vs. HC19 verified this effect (Group *F* (1,36) = 5.73, *p* = .02). Effect sizes indicated larger differences in alpha power modulation prior to FAT (fearful condition *g* = 1.29, happy condition *g* = 1.08) than after FAT (fearful condition *g* = .66, happy condition *g* = .58). Thus, dysfunctional oscillatory dynamics can be improved by FAT, though not to full normalization. ## Specificity of intervention effects [Fig. 4](#)illustrates the change in alpha power increase after intervention in the three patient groups. An Intervention (FAT vs. TAU) × Emotion × Time analysis produced a marginal effect of Time, *F* (1,36) = 2.80, *p* = .1 ( *p*  > .1), reflecting some general improvement over time in the pooled sample, and an Intervention × Time interaction, *F* (1,36) = 4.78, *p* = .04 ( *p* = .05), reflecting improvement in the FAT group ( [Fig. 4](#) , left) vs. a nonsignificant decline in the TAU group ( [Fig. 4](#) , right). Thus, changes in alpha power modulation were specific to training. Here and below, no main effects of Intervention emerged. That was as anticipated, given random assignment to group, with group variance therefore expected only in Intervention × Time effects. The final a priori ANOVA assessed whether this improvement in alpha response with active training was specific to FAT. An Intervention (FAT vs. CE) × Emotion × Time analysis produced an effect of Time, *F* (1,36) = 8.54, *p* = .006 ( *p* = .008), reflecting improvement with training, but no Intervention × Time interaction, indicating similar improvement in the two active treatment groups ( [Fig. 4](#) ). ## Omnibus test An omnibus Intervention (FAT, CE, TAU) × Emotion × Time analysis is of some value as a control for experiment-wise error. Because the primary relevant hypothesis such an analysis addresses, that intervention improves brain function, is directional, a one-tailed test of the Time effect would be appropriate, or equivalently a *p* = .10 criterion for the ANOVA effect. The Time effect exceeded that criterion, *F* (1,54) = 4.81, *p* = .03 ( *p* = .06), with alpha power increase from prestimulus baseline during the pre-recognition period of the FAR criterion task larger after training than before training. A secondary hypothesis that an omnibus test could address is that interventions differed in their impact, thus a nondirectional Intervention × Time effect, which was marginal, *F* (2,54) = 2.44, *p*  < .10 ( *p* = .10). However, the motivation for the present study was the series of specific, directional, a priori hypotheses provided above, which, to achieve partial experiment-wise error protection, were tested with a two-tailed criterion. ## Relationship of FAT performance and alpha activity on the FAR criterion task In the FAT group, alpha power increase in a left fronto-central sensor cluster ( [Fig. 5](#) left panel) varied with performance improvement during the blended emotion task ( *r* = .46, *p*  < .05; [Fig. 5](#) right panel). ## Neuropsychological test performance As expected in an SZ sample (e.g., [Kern et al., 2008, 2011](#) ), patient performance was below the normative *T* -score of 50 and varied by MCCB Domain ( *F* (6,324) = 12.83, *p*  < .001, HF = .94). MCCB performance generally improved after intervention (Time *F* (1,54) = 28.45, *p*  < .001). A Domain × Time interaction ( *F* (6,324) = 4.05, *p* = .001, HF = .91) reflected improvement in Processing Speed ( *F* (1,56) = 33.56, *p*  < .01), Attentional Vigilance ( *F* (1,56) = 15.82, *p*  < .01), and Visual Learning ( *F* (1,56) = 11.99, *p* = .001) but not in Working Memory, Verbal Learning, Reasoning, or Social Cognition (see [Table 2](#) for normative *T* -scores). There was a Time × Intervention effect, *F* (2,54) = 3.70, *p* = .03, resulting from significant performance improvement on Reasoning after CE, *t* (18) = 2.06, *p* = .05, not after FAT or TAU. There was no Time × Intervention × Domain effect ( *F* (12, 324) = 1.28, *p*  > .1). Thus, these improvements did not depend on type of treatment. Change in alpha power increase from baseline between pre- and post-intervention was not related to changes in neuropsychological test performance (MCCB) or in clinical status (symptom severity, GAF). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background and Aims: Ropivacaine is a new amide, long acting, pure S-enantiomer, local anesthetic, with differential blocking effect. The addition of clonidine to local anesthetic improves the quality of peripheral nerve blocks. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of clonidine on characteristics of ropivacaine-induced supraclavicular brachial plexus block. ## Material and Methods: A total of 60 adult patients were randomly recruited to two groups of 30 each: Group I: 30 ml 0.75% ropivacaine + 1 ml normal saline. Group II: 30 ml 0.75% ropivacaine + 1 mcg/kg clonidine diluted to 1 ml with normal saline. ## Results: The onset of sensorimotor block was earlier in Group II (4.36 ± 0.81 min for sensory block and 9.83 ± 1.12 min for motor block) than in Group I (4.84 ± 0.65 min for sensory block and 10.85 ± 0.79 min for motor block). The duration of both sensory and motor block were significantly prolonged by clonidine ( *P* < 0.001). The duration of analgesia was also prolonged in patients receiving clonidine (613.10 ± 51.797 min vs. 878.33 ± 89.955 min). Although incidence of hypotension and bradycardia was higher in Group II when compared to Group I, it was not clinically significant. ## Conclusions: Ropivacaine 0.75% is well-tolerated and provides effective surgical anesthesia as well as relief of postoperative pain. Clonidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine significantly enhances the quality of supraclavicular brachial plexus block by faster onset, prolonged duration of sensory and motor block and improved postoperative analgesia, without associated adverse effects at the dose used. # Results There was no statistically significant difference in the demographic profile and the baseline values of hemodynamic variables between the two groups [ [Table 1](#) ]. One patient in the control group had block failure and was given general anesthesia. He was excluded from further statistical analysis involving block characteristics and hemodynamic changes after the block. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract Vitamin D deficiency was common among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and had negative influence on treatment outcome. Correction of vitamin D deficiency improved treatment response. Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) involved in inflammatory responses in CHC. Their higher levels at pretreatment of CHC could predict poorer responses. Vitamin D suppressed expression of IP-10 from monocytes *in vitro*. In CHC patients, DPP IV involved in IP-10 regulation. We hypothesized that correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in CHC patients might restore immune dysregulation through a pathway linked to the TH1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 or DPP IV. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 80 CHC patients with vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were assigned to receive vitamin D (40) or placebo (40) supplements for 6 weeks. The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], Th1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 and DPP IV were measured at baseline and at the 6th week. At the end of study, the mean 25(OH)D level in vitamin D group was significantly increased and normalised. There were no changes in the level of Th1/Th2 cytokines. Our important finding revealed that upon correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, the serum IP-10 and DPP IV levels were decreased significantly as compare to the placebo group (delta changes; 83.27 vs -133.80; 95% CI [-326.910, -40.758], p = 0.0125, and 271.04 vs -518.69; 95% CI [-1179,15, -59.781], p = 0.0305, respectively. As previous evidences suggested that each factor individually influenced and predicted outcome of CHC treatment. Our results offer a new insight and help to piece the puzzle of vitamin D deficiency, IP-10 and DPP IV together in CHC. **Trial registration:** Thai Clinical Trials Registry TCTR20160429001 # Results ## Study patients at baseline From January to December 2014, 80 patients were included into this study and randomly assigned to receive a placebo (n = 40) vitamin D supplement (n = 40). 42 patients were naïve cases without previous CHC treatment and 38 patients were previously failed therapy either relapsers or non-responders. Demographic and clinical characteristics were shown in [Table 1](#). The mean age was 52.39 years (range; 30--70). ::::table-wrap\n",

The mean serum DPP IV levels were not significant difference between pre-and post-supplements in both groups. During 6-week period, the mean DPP IV level in placebo group had trend to increase, and on the opposite direction, the mean level was decreased in vitamin D group. Comparing the mean changes (or delta changes) between the two groups showed significant differences, placebo group 255.46 ± 216.35 vs vitamin D group -521.79 ± 228.09; 95% CI [-1179.15, -59.781], p = 0.03 ([Table 3](#) and [Fig 2](#)). An effect size analysis (Cohen's d) was used to a quantitative measure of the strength of the outcome. The result showed strong magnitude of vitamin d changes (2.47), and moderate effect of VD on the changes of IP-10 (0.59) and DPP IV (0.55) levels ([Table 3](#)). The results also suggested that this RCT was performed with reasonable number of cases. We try to assess whether in this total population (80 CHC cases), serum levels of VD would affect the IP-10 levels in general. As shown in the scatter plot ([Fig 3](#)), even the dots are quite scattered, the best fit line could be plotted and the regression equation of [IP-10 = 841.34--4.45 x VD] was demonstrated. In other words, we could postulate that serum IP-10 decreases with increase in serum VD levels, and each unit of VD increase will lead to 4.5 unit decrease in serum IP-10. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0174608.g003 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Scatter plot of post treatment VD levels (x-axis) and post treatment IP-10 level (y-axis) including fit line and regression equation were demonstrated.</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "# Abstract In order to assess the effects of juice feedings during acute diarrhea a double-blind, randomized study was performed in 90 children, mean age of 10 ± 4.28 months. Thirty patients with acute diarrhea were fed twice-daily 15 ml/kg of Apple Juice (AJ), 30 received White Grape Juice (WGJ), and 30 were given colored and flavored water (WA) as part of their age appropriate dietary intake. The duration and severity of diarrhea were the main endpoint variables of the study performed in a metabolic unit. The patients were similar among the 3 groups, had diarrhea for 50--64 hours prior to admission, and were dehydrated when admitted to the unit for study. Half of the patients in each group were well nourished and the others had mild to moderate degrees of malnutrition. Rotavirus infection was the agent causing the illness in 63% of the patients. The infants fed juice ingested 14--17% more calories than those given WA, (those receiving AJ and WGJ ingested 95 and 98 Calories/Kg/d respectively) whereas those receiving WA consumed 81 cal/kg/d). The increased energy intake was not at the expense of other foods or milk formula. The mean body weight gain was greater among patients receiving WGJ (+ 50.7 gm) as compared with the patients in the AJ group (+ 18.3 gm) or the patients fed WA (- 0.7 gm) (p = 0.08). The duration of the illness was longer in the infants fed juice as compared with those given WA (p = 0.006), the mean +/- SD duration in hours was 49.4 ± 32.6, 47.5 ± 38.9 and 26.5 ± 27.4 in patients fed AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. All patients improved while ingesting juice and none of them developed persistent diarrhea; most recovered within 50 hours of the beginning of treatment and less than one fourth had diarrhea longer than 96 hours in the unit. The fecal losses were also increased among the juice fed patients (p = 0.001); the mean ± SD fecal excretion in g/kg/h was 3.94 ± 2.35, 3.59 ± 2.35, and 2.19 ± 1.63 in AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. The stool output was highest during the first day of treatment among all the patients, though those fed AJ had the highest volume of fecal losses and those who received WA had the lowest stool excretion. After the first day of treatment the differences in fecal excretion were not significant. The ability to tolerate carbohydrates during the illness and immediately after recovery was similar among the 3 groups of patients. Intake of juices with different fructose/glucose ratios and osmolarities resulted in more fecal losses and more prolonged diarrhea as compared with water feedings, but the patients given juice ingested more calories and gained more weight, particularly among those being fed the juice with equimolar concentrations of fructose and glucose. # Results The clinical characteristics and the laboratory data of the patients on admission are shown in tables [2](#) and [3](#). The patients in each of the 3 groups were similar in age, duration and severity of diarrhea, presence of fever and vomiting. Also there were no differences in the proportion of patients who received breast feedings or in their nutritional status. Over 46% of patients studied in each group, were well nourished, more than 33% showed mild body weight deficits (<1 SD) and the others had mild to moderate malnutrition (>2 SD). All patients presented some dehydration (mild to moderate), and required no intravenous hydration therapy. Differences in clinical characteristics were not significant among groups. ::::table-wrap\n",

In all instances iron supplementation was prescribed at the completion of the study. Rotavirus was identified in the stools of 55 of the patients, in 4 there was a pathogenic Escherichia Coli, in 10 there were parasites detected, and in the remaining 21 infants there were no stool pathogens identified. The daily intake of the patients while in the study is shown in table [4](#). The amount of water, milk formula, and breast milk feedings did not differ among the groups. However, the infants given WGJ readily consumed more juice than those fed AJ or WA. The total energy intake was higher in the juice fed groups as compared with the WA one. The WGJ patients ingested an average of 17% more calories on a daily basis, and the AJ infants consumed a mean of 14% more than the WA group. The increased energy intake was not at the expense of the other foods; both milk formula and complementary foods were ingested in similar quantities among the 3 groups of patients. The mean body weight gain was also higher among the juice fed patients; there was a mean weight gain of 18.3 gm in the AJ fed patients and of 50.6 gm in those given WGJ, whereas there was a mean loss of body weight (- 7.0 gm) among the WA group patients (p = 0.08). ::::table-wrap\n",

These 2 patients were treated with a lactose free formula, with improvement in stool output. There were three other patients who showed carbohydrate intolerance with acid stools or sugars in feces among the 3 groups, they improved without any dietary modifications. Vomiting was present in all groups of patients: 22 (AJ), 26 (WGJ), and 19 (WA) during the first day of treatment; nevertheless this did not represented a limitation for Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) or feeding regimen and no patient was withdrawn or shifted to another therapy due to vomiting.

Most infants did not show breath hydrogen excretion levels above 20 ppm; and there were 17, 16 and 10 patients among the AJ, WGJ and WA groups respectively, who failed to show BH2 levels above 5 ppm at any time. Only 18 patients demonstrated a delta BH2 level increase above the basal value of more than 20 ppm. Eight of them were given AJ, 6 were fed WGJ and 4 received WA. There were 11, 16, and 13 patients in each group who exhibited a BH2 value above 20 ppm independent of the delta differences from basal among the WGJ, AJ and WA fed groups respectively.

      "# Abstract ## Purpose To examine the pooled per-protocol ocular end points from two conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) clinical trials of the dual-action antihistamine bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution (BBOS) 1.5%. ## Methods Two Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized clinical trials were conducted at a total of six separate centers using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis. The same study design was employed for both clinical trials, with subjects randomly assigned to either BBOS 1.5% (n=78) or placebo (n=79) treatment. Each subject received one eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours prior to a CAC. Primary ocular end points included changes in ocular itching reported at 3, 5, and 7 minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7, 15, and 20 minutes following each CAC. Secondary ocular end points included chemosis as well as episcleral and ciliary hyperemia judged by investigators, and tearing (scored as either absent or present) and eyelid swelling judged by subjects. ## Results A statistically significant reduction in ocular itching was observed for BBOS 1.5% treatment compared to placebo at all time points (*P*<0.0001), while measures for onset and 8-hour persistence of action also reached clinical significance (ie, ≥1.0 unit difference) at a majority of time points. In addition, a significant reduction in conjunctival hyperemia was achieved at a majority of time points during the onset of action CAC test. Secondary end points were also significantly improved compared to placebo, most prominently for reduced tearing at all study visits and reduced eyelid swelling at the onset of action and 8-hour study visits. Adverse events were generally mild and transient. ## Conclusion BBOS 1.5% rapidly reduced CAC-induced ocular itching with duration of effectiveness of at least 8 hours after dosing. Certain secondary signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced. # Results ## Subject characteristics Subject demographics were well balanced between the BBOS 1.5% and placebo treatment groups ([Table 2](#)). No significant differences were found in the pair-wise comparison of the demographic characteristics between the BBOS 1.5% and placebo treatment groups. ## Subject disposition A total of 439 subjects were screened as part of either the single-site or the multicenter trials. Of those, 202 subjects were excluded at visit 1 or visit 2 because they did not meet all of the inclusion criteria ([Figure 1](#)). A total of 237 patients were subsequently enrolled and assigned to treatment groups according to a computer-generated randomization code at visit 3A. A third treatment arm that was not included in this analysis of pooled data, BBOS 1.0%, accounted for 80 of these subjects and has been previously discussed.[33](#),[34](#) The remaining 157 subjects comprised the intent-to-treat population. Of these, 140 subjects completed the study without a significant protocol deviation, and thus this subgroup constituted the per protocol population. ## Efficacy ### Ocular itching For the PP population, the differences in mean ocular itching scores between the BBOS 1.5% and the placebo group were found to be statistically significant (*P*<0.001) at all visits and time points by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and across all time points at a study visit by ANCOVA assessments ([Table 3](#)). In addition, the onset and 8-hour persistence-of-action measures were also clinically significant at all time points. A comparison of the difference between onset and 8-hour persistence-of-action scores shows that the treatment effect remained relatively constant over this time period (differences of 1.4--1.6 units at onset, and 1.3--1.5 units at 8 hours). Differences in mean ocular itching scores for BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo for the 16-hour persistence-of-action measures were also statistically significant (*P*<0.001) at all time points; however, the range of differences did not reach ≥1.0 unit difference at a majority of time points, the standard prospectively designated as clinically significant. [Figure 2A](#) shows the data for ocular itching scores by degree of resolution of itching (itching score =0), and demonstrates that more subjects in the BBOS 1.5% group compared to those in the placebo group experienced complete relief of CAC-induced ocular itching. BBOS 1.5% was statistically superior to placebo at all CAC visits. In addition, the majority of BBOS 1.5% subjects reported zero itching at the onset of action as early as 3 minutes after a CAC. Total itching relief was sustained at the 8-hour persistence-of-action visit for one-third of all subjects. In addition, a sizable number of subjects experienced complete relief from ocular itch even at the 16-hour persistence-of-action visit. [Figure 2B](#) shows the proportion of severely allergic subjects (baseline [visit 2] ocular itching scores ≥3) who experienced complete resolution of CAC-induced ocular itching. The data demonstrate that the extent of complete relief was significantly better for BBOS 1.5% than for placebo at all study visits and was comparable to the results of the entire PP population, as seen in [Figure 2A](#). ### Conjunctival hyperemia [Table 4](#) shows the differences in mean conjunctival hyperemia scores for the PP population. Numerical reduction in hyperemia scores was superior for BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo at almost all time points. Statistically significant differences were seen at a majority of time points for the onset-of-action CAC test. However, the criterion for clinical significance (≥1.0 unit reduction) was not met at any study visit. ### Secondary efficacy variables Consistent improvements in several secondary efficacy variables were seen with BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo. Data for ocular tearing were notable and are summarized in [Table 5](#). The percentage of subjects exhibiting tearing in response to a CAC ranged from 23%--39% from onset of action to 16 hours after drug instillation in placebo-treated eyes compared to 6%--15% from onset of action up to 16 hours after drug instillation in BBOS 1.5%-treated eyes. This reduction was both statistically and clinically significant for all time points measured. Additional end points, including ciliary and episcleral hyperemia, chemosis, and eyelid swelling, are summarized in [Table 6](#). All measures showed improvement for BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo based upon reduced mean scores. In particular, all of the end points showed statistically significant reductions by BBOS 1.5% at the onset-of-action CAC test for either all time points (chemosis and eyelid swelling) or the majority of the assessed time points (ciliary and episcleral hyperemia), and the results for ciliary and episcleral hyperemia were very similar to those seen for conjunctival hyperemia. Eyelid swelling was significantly reduced by BBOS 1.5% at all of the 8-hour persistence-of-action time points. ## Safety The AEs from these studies were based upon a safety population of all subjects who received at least one instillation of BBOS 1.5% or placebo. Overall, there were a total of 24 AEs in the PP population reported for the BBOS 1.5% treatment group and ten AEs in the placebo treatment group ([Table 7](#)). AEs in the PP population were generally non-ocular and not considered related to the test agent. The most common non-ocular AEs included nasopharyngitis (n=3 for both treatment groups) and a mild taste upon instillation for the BBOS 1.5% treatment group (n=4). Among the few AEs that were ocular, the most commonly reported was eye irritation, which was seen in both the placebo (n=2) and BBOS 1.5% (n=3) treatment groups. In addition, visits throughout both CAC trials included an ocular examination by slit-lamp biomicroscopy for each subject, and there were no clinically significant findings reported in the course of these examinations. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Purpose To study the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of rising single doses of macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in healthy male subjects. ## Methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in seven groups of eight healthy male subjects. Doses of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 and 600 mg or placebo (two subjects per group) were administered. Plasma macitentan and endothelin-1 and serum total bile salt concentrations were measured and analysed non-compartmentally. Plasma and urine were analysed qualitatively for the presence of metabolites and one of these, ACT-132577, was also measured quantitatively in plasma. Standard tolerability measurements were performed throughout the study. ## Results Macitentan was slowly absorbed and, at a dose of 300 mg, the t~1/2~ (95% confidence interval, CI) was 17.5 h (14.1, 21.8). The dose-proportionality coefficient β for C~max~ (95% CI) was 0.83 (0.79, 0.87) indicating less than dose-proportional pharmacokinetics of macitentan. In plasma, a pharmacologically active oxidative depropyl metabolite, ACT-132577, was found whereas in urine two minor metabolites were detected. The t~1/2~ of ACT-132577 (95% CI) was 65.6 h (53.1, 80.9). Macitentan dose-dependently increased endothelin-1 concentrations up to 2.2-fold (95% CI 1.4, 2.4) at a dose of 600 mg, but had no consistent effect on total bile salts. Macitentan was well tolerated up to and including a dose of 300 mg, the maximum tolerated dose. Headache, nausea and vomiting were dose-limiting adverse events. ## Conclusion The pharmacokinetic and tolerability profile of macitentan is consistent with a once-a-day dosing regimen and warrants further investigation in clinical studies. # Results ## Subjects and tolerability Fifty-six healthy male Caucasian subjects (age range: 19--49 years, body weight range: 55.4--98.0 kg) participated in this study and all completed the study as per protocol. A summary of the adverse events reported during the study, including those adverse events judged to be unrelated to study medication, is provided in Table [1](#). No unexpected adverse events, signs of oedema and/or serious adverse events were reported and all events resolved without sequelae. Up to and including a dose of 300 mg, the adverse event profile of macitentan did not significantly differ from that of placebo, whereas more adverse events than in the placebo group were reported at a dose of 600 mg. In this latter dose group, 5 out of 6 subjects reported headache of moderate intensity, accompanied by nausea and vomiting in 2 subjects. Two cases of increased alanine aminotransferase to about 2 times the upper limit of normal or less were observed: in a subject who had received 600 mg of macitentan and the other in a subject who had received placebo. Both cases occurred 7 days after drug administration, whereas 48 h after administration liver enzymes were normal. In neither subject was a significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase noted, nor were there any changes in total bile salt concentrations. There were no clinically significant drug-related effects on vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory variables. ::::table-wrap\n",

Under fasting conditions, macitentan was absorbed slowly with a median t~max~ varying from 8 to 30 h for the different dose groups. After attainment of C~max~, plasma concentrations decreased slowly. The apparent terminal half-life could only be reliably estimated for the two higher dose groups and was about 16 h. The pharmacokinetics of macitentan showed a less than dose-proportional increase for C~max~ as indicated by a value for the dose proportionality coefficient β (95% CI) of 0.83 (0.79, 0.87). Formation of the depropyl metabolite was slow with maximum concentrations attained at least 30 h after dosing (Fig. [2](#), Table [3](#)). In comparison to the parent compound, plasma concentrations of the metabolite were higher and elimination was slower as demonstrated by mean t~1/2~ values varying from 40.2 to 65.6 h. This resulted in a total exposure (AUC~0−∞~) to the metabolite that was 2.7-fold (95% CI 2.5, 2.9) greater than that to macitentan at a dose of 600 mg. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Arithmetic mean plasma concentration–time profiles of macitentan (<em>top panel</em>) and ACT-132577 (<em>bottom panel</em>) in healthy subjects (<em>n</em> = 6 per group except for 600 mg dose where <em>n</em> = 5) after administration of a single dose of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 or 600 mg of macitentan</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

The C~max~ values for parent and metabolite were within the range observed for the other subjects, but the elimination of both compounds was much slower. ## Metabolic profiling The investigation of the metabolic profile showed that in plasma only two compounds could be identified containing bromine atoms, macitentan and its metabolite, ACT-132577. In urine, the presence of two other compounds was shown, one that corresponds to a metabolite formed by hydrolysis of either macitentan or ACT-132577, and the other compound, based on the molecular weight, corresponds to a glucoside analogue of ACT-132577. Because in urine no macitentan and ACT-132577 could be detected, the collected urine samples were not analysed for these compounds. ## Pharmacodynamics Plasma endothelin-1 concentrations dose-dependently increased following administration of macitentan (Fig. [3](#)) and this effect was statistically significant for doses of 25 mg and higher. The maximum effect was observed with the dose of 600 mg, which increased endothelin-1 concentrations 2.2-fold (95% CI 1.4, 3.4) compared with placebo. Administration of macitentan had no dose-dependent effect on serum total bile salt concentration at single doses of up to 600 mg, although a small but statistically significant effect (*P* < 0.05) was observed for the lowest dose (Fig. [3](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Arithmetic mean (±SD) plasma endothelin-1 (<em>top panel</em>) and serum total bile salt (<em>bottom panel</em>) concentrations in healthy subjects after administration of a single dose of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 or 600 mg of macitentan (<em>n</em> = 6 per dose group) or placebo (<em>n</em> = 14). *<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05 compared with placebo</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background and Objectives: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a relatively common, chronic inflammatory condition that frequently presents with symptoms of pain and burning sensation. It is generally a very unrelenting disorder despite several kinds of treatment. Only symptomatic OLP requires treatment, and it remains a challenging predicament. Efforts are made in a sustained manner for searching for novel therapies for symptomatic OLP. Therefore, this study was aimed to compare the efficacy of treatment with topical pimecrolimus cream 1% with that of triamcinolone acetonide oral paste 0.1% in subjects with symptomatic OLP. ## Materials and Methods: A prospective, parallel-group, randomized, active control clinical study was conducted among 30 symptomatic OLP subjects (20 females and 10 males, with 15 patients in each treatment group) treated with topical pimecrolimus 1% cream and triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% oral paste four times daily for two consecutive months and treatment-free follow-up was performed for 2 months. Pain or burning sensation, mean clinical score and presence of erythematous areas were assessed. The data obtained were statistically analyzed using Wilcoxon's Rank test and the Mann Whitney test. ## Results: Subjects in both the groups showed significant improvement in symptom scores; however, the overall treatment response was higher in the pimecrolimus group compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group. On intergroup comparison, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the reduction in burning sensation ( *P* = 0.18) and erythematous area ( *P* = 0.07), but there was a statistically highly significant improvement in reduction of clinical scoring ( *P* < 0.01%). Following the termination of the treatment, sustained remission of symptoms and long-lasting therapeutic effects was detected in 93.3% of the patients treated with pimecrolimus. ## Interpretation and Conclusion: Topical pimecrolimus 1% cream showed better therapeutic response compared with triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% oral paste in subjects with symptomatic OLP. # RESULTS A total of 30 adult subjects were enrolled in the study, 20 females and 10 males, suggesting female predilection with a male to female ratio of 2:1. The age of the patients ranged from 20 to 64 years, and the mean age of the subjects was 36.7 ± 13.4 years.

      "# Abstract # Abstract ## Background: In some studies, gum-chewing was demonstrated to have a beneficial effect on resumption of bowel function; however, other contradictory findings in other studies refute the effects of gum-chewing on peristaltic movements and digestive system stimulation. In addition, most previous studies were after colorectal or gynecology surgery, whereas few reports focused on the effect of gum-chewing after gastrectomy. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of gum-chewing on postoperative bowel function in patients who had undergone laparoscopic gastrectomy. ## Methods: From March 2014 to March 2016, 75 patients with gastric cancer received elective laparoscopic surgery in Shanghai Tongji hospital and were postoperatively randomly divided into 2 groups: 38 in a gum-chewing (Gum) group and 37 in a control (No gum) group. The patients in the Gum group chewed sugarless gum 3 times daily, each time for at least 15 minutes, until the day of postoperative exhaust defecation. ## Results: The mean time to first flatus (83.4 ± 35.6 vs. 79.2 ± 24.2 hours; *P* = 0.554) and the mean time to first defecation (125.7 ± 41.2 vs. 115.4 ± 34.2 hours; *P* = 0.192) were no different between the no gum and Gum groups. There was also no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative ileus (*P* = 0.896) and postoperative hospital stay (*P* = 0.109) between the 2 groups. The postoperative pain score at 48 hours (*P* = 0.032) in the Gum group was significantly higher than in the no gum group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in regards to patient demographics, comorbidities, duration of surgery, complications, and nausea/vomiting score. ## Conclusion: Gum-chewing after laparoscopic gastrectomy did not hasten the return of gastrointestinal function. In addition, gum-chewing may increase patient pain on the second postoperative day. # Results Between March 2014 and March 2016, 85 patients participated in this trial. After 10 patients were excluded before randomization (see flowchart), a total of 75 patients were randomly assigned to either the Gum (n = 38) or No gum (n = 37) group. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups (Table [2](#)). There were no differences in sex, age, comorbidities, and ASA grade. Twenty-one patients in the No gum group had comorbidities before their operations, as did 21 patients in the Gum group. The most common comorbidities included primary hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, post-stroke syndrome, and coronary artery disease. ::::table-wrap\n",

There was no significant difference in the duration of operation between the 2 groups. The rates of POI of the 2 groups did not significantly differ. In the No gum group, 1 patient developed CD grade I complications: wound infection requiring dressing change. Grade II complications occurred in 2 patients: pneumonia requiring antibiotics. One patient developed a grade III complication: pleural effusion and atelectasis requiring thoracocentesis under local anesthesia. In the Gum group, 1 patient developed CD grade I complications: wound infection requiring dressing change. Grade II complications occurred in 4 patients: 2 developed pneumonia requiring antibiotics, 1 developed liver abscess requiring antibiotics, and 1 developed congestive heart failure requiring cardiac glycosides and diuretics. Two patients developed a grade III complication: pleural effusion and atelectasis requiring thoracocentesis under local anesthesia. There was no perioperative mortality in this series. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with fentanyl was administered to all the patients. There was no significant difference in fentanyl consumption between the 2 groups (*P* = 0.969).

      "# Abstract ## Background Cigarette smoke contains free radicals and an have adverse effect to the immune system. Supplementation of palm oil vitamin E (palmvitee), is known has antioxidant properties is thought to be beneficial for system immune protection against free radicals activity. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of palmvitee supplementation on immune response in smokers. ## Methods This study involved a group of smokers and nonsmokers who received 200 mg/day palmvitee and placebo for the control group. Blood samples were taken at 0, 12 and 24 weeks of supplementation. Plasma tocopherol and tocotrienol were determined by HPLC, lymphocyte proliferation by lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) and enumeration of lymphocytes T and B cells by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed by Mann--Whitney *U*-test for non-parametric data distribution and correlation among the variables was examined by Spearman. ## Results Plasma tocopherol and tocotrienol were increased in vitamin E supplemented group as compared to placebo group. Urine cotinine levels and serum α~1~-antitrypsin were significantly higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Lymphocyte proliferation induced by PHA showed an increasing trend with palmvitee supplementation in both smokers and nonsmokers. Natural killer cells were decreased; CD4^+^ cells and B cells were increased in smokers compared to nonsmokers but were unaffected with vitamin E supplementation except in the percentage of B cells which were increased in nonsmokers supplemented palmvitee compared to placebo. CD4^+^/CD8^+^ ratio was increased in smokers compared to nonsmokers. The high TWBC count observed in smokers correlated with the increased CD4^+^ and B cells. ## Conclusions Smoking caused alterations in certain immune parameters and palmvitee supplementation tended to cause an increase in lymphocytes transformation test but had no effect on CD3^+^, CD4^+^, CD8^+^, NK cells and B cells except B cells percentage in nonsmokers. # Results ## Plasma total vitamin E level There was no difference in total plasma vitamin E, tocopherol and tocotrienol levels in smokers and nonsmokers at the beginning of the study (Figure  [1](#) & Table  [1](#)). After palmvitee supplementation, both plasma tocopherol and tocotrienol concentration were increased in smokers and nonsmokers (p < 0.05) starting from 12 weeks until the end of the experiment. Tocopherol concentration was higher in plasma as compared to tocotrienol. Urinary cotinine and serum α~1~-antitrypsin of smokers were significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to nonsmokers (Table  [1](#)) but no changes were observed with supplementation. Urinary cotinine levels were increased accordingly to the number of cigarettes per day (Table  [2](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Total plasma vitamin E concentration in smokers and nonsmokers.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the importance of providing guidelines to patients via active telephone calls for blood pressure control and for preventing the discontinuation of treatment among hypertensive patients. ## INTRODUCTION: Many reasons exist for non-adherence to medical regimens, and one of the strategies employed to improve treatment compliance is the use of active telephone calls. ## METHODS: Hypertensive patients (n = 354) who could receive telephone calls to remind them of their medical appointments and receive instruction about hypertension were distributed into two groups: a) \"uncomplicated\" -- hypertensive patients with no other concurrent diseases and b) \"complicated\" - severe hypertensive patients (mean diastolic ≥110 mmHg with or without medication) or patients with comorbidities. All patients, except those excluded (n = 44), were open-block randomized to follow two treatment regimens (\"traditional\" or \"current\") and to receive or not receive telephone calls (\"phone calls\" and \"no phone calls\" groups, respectively). ## RESULTS: Significantly fewer patients in the \"phone calls\" group discontinued treatment compared to those in the \"no phone calls\" group (4 vs. 30; p<0.0094). There was no difference in the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure in the \"phone calls\" group and \"no phone calls\" group or in the \"traditional\" and \"current\" groups. The percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) was increased at the end of the treatment (74%), reaching 80% in the \"uncomplicated\" group and 67% in the \"complicated\" group (p<0.000001). ## CONCLUSION: Guidance to patients via active telephone calls is an efficient strategy for preventing the discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment. # RESULTS The study included 398 patients. Of those, 44 were excluded for the following reasons: a) lack of enrollment in the Biosintética Assistance program (n = 17); b) body mass index >40 kg/m^2^ (n = 6); c) secondary hypertension (n = 4); d) white-coat hypertension (n = 3); e) white-coat normotension (\"masked hypertension\") (n = 3); f) alcohol use (n = 2); g) classification error (n = 4); h) refusal to do ABPM (n = 2); i) loss of blood pressure measurements from the first visit (n = 1); j) pregnancy (n = 1); k) death (n = 1). A total of 354 patients were evaluated. There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, skin color, body mass index, blood pressure or heart rate between the groups classified as: \"complicated\" (n = 175) and \"uncomplicated\" (n = 179); \"traditional\" (n = 176) and \"current\" (n = 178); \"phone calls\" (n = 108) and \"no phone calls\" (n = 246) ([Table 1](#)). In addition, no differences were seen in marital status, education or occupation. ## a) Control of Blood Pressure A marked reduction in blood pressure was seen in patients from both the \"complicated\" and \"uncomplicated\" groups ([Table 2](#)). The blood pressure was reduced by 19±10/20±14 mmHg in the \"uncomplicated\" group and by 18±14/22±17 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) in the \"complicated\" group (p>0.05; n = 354). The \"phone calls\" and \"no phone calls\" groups showed significantly lower blood pressures at the end of treatment (p< 0.00001). The \"traditional\" and \"current\" groups showed significantly lower blood pressures at the end of treatment ([Figure 1](#)). The percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) was also high at the end of treatment (74%). On the other hand, the percentage of patients with blood pressure reduced to <120/80 mmHg was only 29%. There was no difference in the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure between the \"phone calls\" and \"no phone calls\" groups or in the reduction of blood pressure and the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure among the \"traditional\" and \"current\" treatments. However, patients in the \"phone calls\" group (80%) had better blood pressure control than those in the \"no phone calls\" group (71%), though the difference was not statistically significant. The \"uncomplicated\" and \"complicated\" groups had statistically significant differences in the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) (80% vs. 67%, respectively; p<0.000001). At the next to last study visit (visit 7), 90% and 66% of patients had blood pressure measurements <140/90 mmHg in the \"uncomplicated\" and \"complicated\" groups, respectively. However, there was no difference in the percentage of patients with blood pressure <120/80 mmHg (31% on the final visit in both groups, [Table 3](#)). Among patients with a blood pressure <140/90 mmHg at the final visit, only 3% had received only one type of antihypertensive medication; most patients (56%) received 2 (34%) or 3 (22%) types of antihypertensive medication ([Table 4](#)). ## b) Treatment Discontinuation A significantly lower number of patients in the \"phone calls\" group quit the treatment compared to the \"no phone calls\" group (4 vs. 30, respectively; [Figure 2](#)). There was no difference in the percentage discontinuation in the \"complicated\" and \"uncomplicated\" groups or in the \"current\" and \"traditional\" treatment regimens (p>0.05). ## c) Tablet Count Patients in the groups: \"complicated\" and \"uncomplicated\"; \"traditional\" and \"current\"; \"phone calls\" and \"no phone calls\" did not show statistically significant differences in medication intake, as verified by counting the tablets returned at the visits. Compliance was over 85% at all visits. However, patients in the current + uncomplicated + phone call group had the highest rate of compliance (93%). The lowest rate of compliance occurred in the traditional + uncomplicated + no phone call group (85%) (p>0.05). ## d) Body Weight Blood pressure reductions occurred in the presence of increased body weight (baseline visit: 73±14 kg; final visit: 74±14 kg, p = 0.0008, [Table 5](#)). ## e) Adverse Events and Laboratory Tests Most of the adverse events that occurred during the study were of light or moderate intensity. Patients in the \"traditional\" group showed significantly more depression symptoms (5 vs. 0) and coughing (30 vs. 4) when compared with patients in the \"current\" treatment group. On the other hand, patients in the \"current\" group had a greater number of complaints of dizziness when compared to patients in the \"traditional\" treatment group (63 vs. 42, respectively). Compared to patients in the \"uncomplicated\" group, patients in the \"complicated\" group presented a larger number the following symptoms: abdominal pain (19 vs. 8), sleepiness (32 vs. 10), cough (23 vs. 11), weakness (23 vs. 11) and blurred vision (6 vs. 0). Conversely, compared to patients in the \"complicated\" group, patients in the \"uncomplicated\" group presented a larger number of complaints such as pain (74 vs. 53) and headache (80 vs. 59). Patients in the \"phone calls\" group reported a 34% rate of symptoms, while a 66% rate of symptoms was reported by patients in the \"no phone calls\" group. The most frequently (>10%) found adverse events were as follows: headache (62.1%), unspecific pain (58.2%), dizziness (45.8%), edema (40.1%), fatigue (15.3%), sleepiness (14.4%), cough (13.3%), precordial pain (13.3%), weakness (11.9%), tachycardia (11.3%), insomnia (10.5%) and paresthesia (10.5%). There were 26 (8%) severe adverse events: death (5), unstable angina (4), acute myocardial infarction (1), transient ischemic attack (1), hypertensive encephalopathy (1), breast cancer (3), bronchospastic crisis (1), cholecystopathy (1), diabetic decompensation (1), syncope (1), nephrectomy (2), trauma (2), peritoneal bypass (1), diarrhea (1) and gastrectomy (1). The results of the laboratory tests performed in the beginning and end of the study are shown in [Table 6](#). There was an increase in the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion from the beginning to the end of the study (120±46 vs. 129±45 mEq/L, respectively; p = 0.000036) ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Despite the fact that numerous medications have been introduced to treat renal colic, none has been proven to relieve the pain rapidly and thoroughly. In this study, we aimed at comparing the effects of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine in patients suffering from renal colic. ## Methods In a prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial performed in the emergency department of Imam Reza educational hospital of Tabriz, Iran, we studied 240 patients, 18--65 years old, who were referred due to renal colic. Patients were divided into two groups. In group I (120 people) single-dose intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) was administered and in group II (120 people) single-dose intravenous morphine (0.1 mg/kg) was administered slowly. Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) was recorded while admission, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes after injection. Statistical data and results were studied using descriptive statistics as percentage and Mean ± SD. To compare the response to treatment, Mann--Whitney *U*-test was used in two groups. Consequently, the data were analyzed using the SPSS16 software. ## Results Pain score measured in two groups five minutes after the injection of lidocaine and morphine were 65 % and 53 % respectively (95% CI 0.60 - 0.69, CI 0.48 -- 0.57, p = 0.0002).108 (90 %) patients (95 % CI 0.84 -- 0.95) from group I and 84 (70%) patients (95 % CI 0.62 - 0.78) from group II responded appropriately at the end of the complete treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0001). ## Conclusions Changing the smooth muscle tone and reducing the transmission of afferent sensory pathways, lidocaine causes a significant reduction in pain. ## Trial registration Clinical Trials IRCT138901042496N3 # Results Eighty six patients of studied samples were male and thirty four were female in group I. In group II, ninety patients were male and thirty were female.

      "# Abstract # Abstract ## Background Insulin resistance and lipid changes are common after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Observational studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of developing diabetes and improves lipid profiles. ## Methods This 48-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated high-dose vitamin D3 (4000 IU daily) plus calcium supplementation (1000 mg calcium carbonate daily) in HIV-infected participants initiating ART with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF). Changes in insulin resistance (as estimated by homeostatic model assessment), fasting lipid profile, and components of the metabolic syndrome were assessed at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks. Stratified Wilcoxon rank sum tests and stratified normal score tests were used to evaluate differences between treatment arms, stratified by screening 25-OH vitamin D stratum (≤/>20 ng/mL). ## Results A total of 165 participants enrolled: 79 in the vitamin D/calcium (Vit D/Cal) arm and 86 in the placebo arm. Only the placebo arm experienced a modest increase in insulin resistance at week 24 (*P* < .001). While increases in total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significant in both arms at weeks 24 and 48, increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at week 24 were only identified in the placebo arm (*P* = .011). Body mass index remained stable, whereas modest increases in waist circumference were observed in the placebo arm. Metabolic syndrome was present in 19 participants (12%) at baseline and 20 participants (14%) at week 48, without differences between arms. ## Conclusions Vit D/Cal supplementation over 48 weeks did not alter the lipid profile or glucose metabolism experienced with initiation of EFV/FTC/TDF in ART-naïve persons. Vitamin D supplementation is unlikely to be an effective strategy to attenuate metabolic dysregulations with ART initiation. # RESULTS The details and disposition of the study population have been previously described [[20](#)]. Of the 165 eligible participants included this analysis (79 in the VitD/Cal arm, 86 in the placebo arm), 148 (90%) completed 48 weeks of study treatment. Twenty-five (15%) participants discontinued EFV/FTC/TDF prematurely (13 in VitD/Cal and 12 in placebo). ## Baseline Demographics Baseline characteristics are shown in [Table 1](#). For the overall study population at baseline, the median age was 33 years, 90% male, 37% white non-Hispanic, 33% black non-Hispanic, with a median body mass index (BMI) of 24.4 kg/m^2^ ([Table 1](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

In the placebo arm, LDL cholesterol increased at week 24 from baseline but not at week 48. However, triglyceride changes from baseline to week 24 or week 48 were not significant in either arm. None of the changes in lipid parameters appeared to differ by treatment arm. ## Glucose Metabolism and Measures of Insulin Resistance Baseline fasting glucose and insulin levels, as well as HOMA-IR values, appear to be balanced between arms ([Table 1](#)). Glucose levels were increased modestly at weeks 24 and 48 in both arms ([Table 2](#)). Insulin levels increased in the placebo arm but not in the VitD/Cal arm at week 24, while the week 48 changes were not statistically significant for either arm. HOMA-IR increases were modest for both arms only at week 24. Between-arm differences were not significant for glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR changes at either week 24 or week 48 (*P* > .05 for all). ## Body Composition and Metabolic Syndrome Baseline waist circumference and BMI values appear to be balanced between the 2 arms ([Table 1](#)). Waist circumference increased in the placebo arm but not in the VitD/Cal arm at both weeks 24 and 48, but differences between the 2 arms were not significant ([Table 2](#)). Changes in BMI were not significant over 48 weeks for either arm. Metabolic syndrome was identified in 19 participants (12%) at baseline and 20 participants (14%) at week 48, with no significant difference between arms. For specific parameters of the metabolic syndrome, low HDL prevalence decreased from a 45% overall prevalence at baseline to 26% at week 48, and elevated TG prevalence increased from a 14% overall prevalence at baseline to 22% at week 48.\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background Preemptive analgesia is the blocking of pain perception afferent pathways before noxious painful stimuli. Clonidine is an alpha agonist drug that is partially selective for α-2 adrenoreceptors. Clonidine is used as anti-anxiety medication and an, analgesic, and it prolongs the duration of the block in the brachial plexus block. ## Objectives To compare the effect of preemptive clonidine with midazolam on intraoperative sedation, duration of block, and postoperative pain scores**.** ## Patients and Methods In a randomized clinical trial, 80 patients with orthopedic fractures of an upper extremity who underwent supraclavicular nerve block were randomly assigned to receive 0.2 mg oral clonidine or 2 mg oral midazolam. Intraoperative sedation was measured at one hour after the start of urgery and again in the PACU (Post-Anesthesia Care Unit) using the Ramsay scale. The duration of sensory blockade was measured. Postoperative pain scores were measured using the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) after entrance to recovery up to 2 hours. ## Results The percentages of patients in the calm and sedated scale were significantly higher in clonidine group (35 and 42.5%, respectively), compared to the midazolam group (17.5 and 17.5%, respectively) (P = 0.042, 0.029; respectively). Those administered fentanyl in the clonidine group 105 ± 30.8 was significantly lower than that for the midazolam group 165 ± 34.5 (P = 0.0018). The percentages of patients in the calm scale were significantly higher in the clonidine group (52.5), compared to the midazolam group (17.5) (P = 0.001) in the post-operative period. VAS scores were significantly lower at one (P = 0.01) and two hours (P = 0.001) after operation in the clonidine group, compared to the midazolam group. ## Conclusions Preemptive clonidine has many marvelous advantages over midazolam, including better sedation inside the operating room and then in the post-operative care unit, lower fentanyl doses are required during surgery, more stable heart rate and blood pressure are observed during the procedure, and patients report lower post-operative pain scores. # 4. Results In a randomized clinical, trial 80 patients enrolled in the study, 40 in the clonidine group and 40 in the midazolam group.

      "# Abstract ## Background Negative attentional biases are thought to increase the risk of recurrence in depression, suggesting that reduction of such biases may be a plausible strategy in the secondary prevention of the illness. However, no previous study has tested whether reducing negative attentional bias causally affects risk factors for depressive recurrence. The current experimental medicine study reports the effects of a computerized attentional bias modification (ABM) procedure on intermediate measures of the risk of depressive recurrence (residual depressive symptoms and the cortisol awakening response) in patients with recurrent depression. ## Methods Sixty-one patients with at least two previous episodes of depression who were currently in remission were randomized to receive either an active (positive) or placebo computer-based ABM regime. The ABM regime presented either pictures of faces or words. Residual depressive symptoms, measured using the Beck Depression Inventory and the cortisol awakening response were measured immediately before and after completion of the bias modification and then again after 4 weeks' follow-up. ## Results Positive, face-based ABM reduced both measures of recurrence risk (Beck Depression Inventory and cortisol awakening response). This effect occurred during the month following completion of bias modification. Word-based modification did not influence the outcome measures. ## Conclusions Positive face-based ABM was able to reduce intermediate measures of recurrence risk in previously depressed patients. These results suggest that ABM may provide a \"cognitive vaccine\" against depression and offer a useful strategy in the secondary prevention of the illness. # Results ## Group Demographics, Baseline Measures, and Compliance As can be seen from [Table 1](#), the groups were well matched on baseline demographics, IQ, and measures of illness severity. Patients had been depressed on an average of three previous occasions. Compliance was generally high with only eight patients completing fewer than 25 sessions of ABM and no difference in compliance between the groups. ## The Effect of ABM on Residual Symptoms Positive, relative to placebo, ABM influenced the residual depressive symptoms reported by patients using the BDI, but this effect depended on whether the ABM used faces or words [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; *F*(2,112) = 3.7, *p* = .03]. There was no general ABM type × time effect [*F*(2,112) = 1.1, *p* = .35]. As can be seen from [Figure 2](#) positive, face-based ABM lead to a reduction of symptoms compared with placebo ABM [[Figure 2](#)A; *F*(2,56) = 3.7, *p* = .03], whereas word based ABM had no significant effect [[Figure 2](#)B; *F*(2,56) < 1, *p* = .4]. Interestingly, the beneficial effect of positive face ABM displayed a time lag; symptoms did not change across the 2 weeks of ABM [ *F*(1,28) < 1, *p* = .5]; rather, they reduced during the follow-up period [*F*(1,28) = 5.9, *p* = .02] with this change resulting from a significant drop in symptoms reported by the positive face ABM group [*t*(15) = 2.4, *p* = .03] and no significant change seen in the placebo face ABM group [*t*(13) < 1, *p* = .4]. Observer reported depressive symptoms, measured using the HRSD, revealed an identical ABM type × ABM stimuli × time interaction [[Figure 2](#)C and [2](#)D; *F*(2,112) = 3.4, *p* = .04]; however, in this case, the post hoc tests of the interaction for face training was significant only at a trend level [*F*(1,28) = 2.9, *p* = .09]. Symptoms of anxiety, measured using the trait subscale of the STAI displayed the same specific effect of positive face ABM as that seen for the BDI [[Figures 2](#)E, F; *F*(2,112) = 3.3, *p* = .05] with the beneficial effect again occurring during follow-up [ *F*(1,28) = 5.2, *p* = .03] and being driven by a significant reduction of anxious symptoms in the positive face ABM group [*t*(15) = 2.4, *p* = .03]. ## The Effect of ABM on the CAR Analysis of the CAR response revealed a significant ABM type × ABM stimuli interaction [*F*(1,53) = 4.3, *p* = .04], which was present across the three time points [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; *F*(2,106)<1, *p* = .4]. In keeping with the effects on residual symptoms, face-based ABM influenced the CAR [[Figure 3](#)A; *F*(2,54) = 4, *p* = .02], whereas word-based ABM did not [[Figure 3](#)B; *F*(2,52) < 1, *p* = .8]. Specifically, positive relative to placebo face ABM caused a reduction of the CAR across the follow-up period [*F*(1,27) = 5, *p* = .03] with no change being seen during ABM [*F*(1,27) < 1, *p* = .9]. This relative reduction was produced by a nonsignificant decrease in the positive ABM group during follow-up [*t*(14) = 1.7, *p* = .1] and a nonsignificant increase in the placebo group [ *t*(13) = 1.5, *p* = .2]. ## The Effect of ABM on Attentional Function Positive relative to placebo bias modification produced a differential effect on attentional bias ([Figure 4](#)), as measured by the word based visual-probe task [ABM type × time; *F*(2,112) = 3.1, *p* = .05]. However, unlike the previous results, this effect did not significantly differ between the face- and word-trained groups [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; *F*(2,112) < 1, *p* = .9]. The effect of ABM was seen across the bias modification period [ *F*(1,57) = 8.3, *p* = .006] with no significant change occurring across follow-up [*F*(1,56) < 1, *p* = .4]. When considering the within group effects produced, positive-face ABM led to a significant increase in positive bias across the modification period [*t*(15) = 3.7, *p* = .002], whereas face placebo ABM did not change the bias [*t*(13) < 1, *p* = .9]. Interestingly, the effect of word ABM was driven by a trend level decrease in bias in the placebo word group [*t*(14) = 2.1, *p* = .051] with no effect seen for positive word ABM [ *t*(15)<1, *p* = .5]. The correlation between change in attentional bias across the bias modification period and reduction in BDI or CAR across the follow-up period in the positive face-ABM group was not significant [ *r*(16) = .37, not significant, and *r*(15) = .34, not significant, respectively]. Additional analysis is provide in [Supplement 1](#). Attentional bias, assessed using face stimuli, was insensitive to the effect of the ABM interventions [*F*(2,112)<1, *p* = 1]. This remained the case when analysis was restricted to those who had completed face based ABM [*F*(2,56) < 1, *p* = .7]. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Study design and attentional bias modification (ABM) task used. <strong>(A)</strong> Patients completed three assessment sessions, immediately before and after 2 weeks of ABM and then again a month later.

On each trial two stimuli were presented, followed by a probe (one or two dots) to which the patients had to respond.

      "# Abstract Recent research on whole-body cryotherapy has hypothesized a major responsibility of head cooling in the physiological changes classically reported after a cryostimulation session. The aim of this experiment was to verify this hypothesis by studying the influence of exposing the head to cold during whole-body cryostimulation sessions, on the thermal response and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Over five consecutive days, two groups of 10 participants performed one whole-body cryostimulation session daily, in one of two different systems; one exposing the whole-body to cold (whole-body cryostimulation, WBC), and the other exposing the whole-body except the head (partial-body cryostimulation, PBC).10 participants constituted a control group (CON) not receiving any cryostimulation. In order to isolate the head-cooling effect on recorded variables, it was ensured that the WBC and PBC systems induced the same decrease in skin temperature for all body regions (mean decrease over the 5 exposures: -8.6°C±1.3°C and -8.3±0.7°C for WBC and PBC, respectively), which persisted up to 20-min after the sessions (P20). The WBC sessions caused an *almost certain* decrease in tympanic temperature from Pre to P20 (-0.28 ±0.11°C), while it only decreased at P20 (-0.14±0.05°C) after PBC sessions. Heart rate *almost certainly* decreased after PBC (-8.6%) and WBC (-12.3%) sessions. Resting vagal-related heart rate variability indices (the root-mean square difference of successive normal *R-R* intervals, RMSSD, and high frequency band, HF) were *very likely* to *almost certainly* increased after PBC (RMSSD:+49.1%, HF: +123.3%) and WBC (RMSSD: +38.8%, HF:+70.3%). Plasma norepinephrine concentration was *likely* increased in similar proportions after PBC and WBC, but only after the first session. Both cryostimulation techniques stimulated the ANS with a predominance of parasympathetic tone activation from the first to the fifth session and in slightly greater proportion with WBC than PBC. The main result of this study indicates that the head exposure to cold during whole-body cryostimulation may not be the main factor responsible for the effects of cryostimulation on the ANS. # Results All data of all subjects were taken into account in the presentation of the results. ## Skin and tympanic temperatures Baseline skin temperature (Tskin) for all body regions was similar between groups before the cryostimulation, without difference between the first and fifth cryostimulation session ([Fig 2](#)). Each day, an *almost certain* very large reduction in mean skin temperature of the whole body was recorded within the 20-min after the PBC and WBC exposures ([Fig 2](#)). However, no difference was recorded between cryotherapy modalities from Post to P20. In both modalities, the mean Tskin *almost certainly* remained lower than baseline values up to P20 ([Fig 2](#)). In both modalities, a *very likely* large reduction in Tskin of the head was recorded in Post and persisted up to P5, in larger proportion for WBC than PBC ([Fig 2](#)). In both cryotherapy modalities, the mean decrease in Tskin for the whole body recorded immediately after (Post) the first cryostimulation session (-8.3±0.7°C and -8.6°C±1.3°C for PBC and WBC, respectively) was *very likely* larger than that recorded after the fifth cryostimulation session (-7.6±0.8°C and -7.7±0.9°C for PBC and WBC, respectively). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0124776.g002 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Changes in the mean skin temperature of the whole body (except the head) and the head alone.<br /> Values were recorded before (Pre), immediately after (Post) and for 20-min (P1 to P20) after the first and the fifth whole-body cryostimulation (WBC), and partial-body cryostimulation (PBC) sessions, and in the control (CON) condition.

There was a trivial difference in the decrease in Ttymp between the first and the last WBC sessions. A small to moderate reduction in Ttymp was recorded after PBC sessions, occurring *almost certainly* in P20 (-0.14±0.05°C). The reduction in Ttymp over the week was *very likely* larger after WBC than PBC in Post (-0.31±0.15°C vs. -0.07±0.12°C for WBC and PBC, respectively) and P5 (-0.26±0.15°C vs. -0.04±0.10°C for WBC and PBC, respectively). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0124776.g003 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Changes in tympanic temperature.<br /> Values were recorded before (Pre), immediately (Post), 5-min (P5), and 20-min (P20) after the first and the fifth whole-body cryostimulation (WBC), and partial-body cryostimulation (PBC) sessions, and in the control (CON) condition.

The first cryostimulation session *likely* induced a moderate to large increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration without any significant difference between PBC and WBC. These changes in plasma norepinephrine concentrations compared with baseline values were associated with a *likely* moderate increase in plasma epinephrine for WBC only.

      "# Abstract Stress-related illnesses are a growing health problem in the Western world; which also has economic significance for society. As a consequence; there is a growing demand for effective treatments. The study investigates the long-term efficacy of the Nacadia^®^ nature-based therapy (NNBT) by comparing it to the efficacy of a validated cognitive behavioral therapy, called STreSS. The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial in which 84 participants are randomly allocated between the treatments. Long-term efficacy is investigated through data extracts from the national database of Statistics Denmark on the sick leave and the health-care consumption. The results show that both the NNBT and the STreSS lead to a significant decrease in number of contacts with a general practitioner in the period from twelve months prior to treatment to twelve months after treatment; and, a significant decrease in long-term sick leave from the month prior to treatment to twelve months after treatment. The positive long-term effects provide validation for the NNBT as an efficient treatment of stress-related illnesses. # 3. Results Of the 83 participants allocated between the two treatments, 41 participants completed the NBT treatment and 40 participants completed the CBT treatment (see [Figure 1](#)). Four participants in the NBT were lost to follow-up because the correct personal identification number was not provided. Five participants were lost to follow-up in the CBT; four participants did not provide the correct personal identification number; and, one participant withdrew consent after the treatment. The results from the background questionnaire showed that the vast majority of participants were women (NBT: 82%, CBT: 82%) with a mean age of 47.9 in NBT and 44.9 in CBT [[11](#)]. The majority had a university bachelor degree or higher education (NBT: 76%, CBT: 68%). The categorization of participants with respect to socioeconomic status showed an even distribution between the two treatments; the majority of participants in both NBT and CBT were employed at the start of treatment (NBT = 20; CBT = 21), and a great number held a top-level position (NBT = 13; CBT = 12) ([Table 1](#)). A substantial proportion of participants were also registered as unemployed at treatment start (NBT = 18; CBT = 18). Of those, 17 participants from the NBT and 16 participants from the CBT were fired from work during the twelve months preceding the start of treatment. Moreover, one participant in the NBT and two participants in the CBT quit their job during that period. ## 3.1. Sick Leave All of the participants were rated as incapacitated for work for at least three months prior to treatment start, as stated in the inclusion criteria, but not all participants were registered as being on sick leave in Statistics Denmark prior to treatment start ([Figure 2](#)). They were, instead, registered as receiving other rehabilitation benefits or as students. The sample distributions, representing the number of months of sick leave, expressed significant deviations from the normal distribution (*p* < 0.05). Efforts to establish normal distributions using various types of statistical transformations were unsuccessful. No significant change was found in the total number of months of sick leave for the participants in the period from twelve months before the treatment compared to the twelve months after the treatment for either the NBT or the CBT treatments (*p* > 0.05). [Figure 2](#) illustrates the continous increase in the number of participants on sick-leave in the twelve months up to the start of treatment and, similarly, the similar decrease in the number of participants on sick leave from the end of the treatment to twelve months after. A significant decrease was found between the participants on sick leave one month prior to treatment and in month twelve after treatment (NBT: *p* < 0.001; CBT: *p* < 0.01), ([Table 2](#)). 23 participants (77%) who were on sick leave prior to treatment and received the NBT treatment were not on sick leave twelve months after completing the treatment ([Table 2](#)). 15 participants (60%) who were on sick leave prior to treatment start and received the CBT treatment were not on sick leave twelve months after completing the treatment ([Table 2](#)). In total, 27 participants from the NBT group and 20 participants from the CBT group were not on sick leave after completing the treatment. ## 3.2. Healthcare Consumption For the NBT and the CBT, there was a significant reduction in number of contacts with a GP twelve months after treatment as compared to the twelve months before treatment (NBT *p* ˂ 0.01; CBT *p* ˂ 0.05) ([Table 3](#)). The sizes of the effect were r = −0.396 (NBT) and r = −0.249 (CBT). In terms of the number of contacts, the median number of contacts with a GP is still much higher for the participants one year after the treatment for both the NBT and the CBT groups when compared to the adult population of Denmark as a whole (mean number of contacts = 5.95) [[24](#)]. (Because the sample did not show a normal distribution, it was decided to use the median value instead of the mean value, which is used in the national sample. Nevertheless, the two statistical measures are still comparable in terms of understanding the central tendency of the statistical scores). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Participant flow diagram.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>The proportion of participants on sick leave from twelve months prior to twelve months after a treatment.

      "# Abstract ## Background Since the first facial allograft transplantation was performed, several institutions have performed the procedure with the main objectives being restoration of the aesthetic appearance and expressive function of the face. The optimal location to transect the facial nerve during flap harvest in transplantation to preserve facial movement function is currently unknown. There are currently two primary methods to perform facial nerve neurorrhaphy between the donor and recipient-one protocol involves transection and repair of the facial nerve at the main trunk while the another protocol advocates for the neurorrhaphy to be performed distally at the main branches. The purpose of this study is to establish the optimal location for transection and repair of the facial nerve to optimize functional recovery of facial movement. ## Methods A prospective randomized controlled trial using a rat model was performed. Two groups of 12 rats underwent facial nerve transection and subsequent repair either at the main trunk of the nerve (group 1) or 2 cm distally, at the main bifurcation (group 2). Primary outcome of nerve functional recovery was measured using a previously validated laser curtain model, which measured amplitude of whisking at 2, 4, and 6 post-operatively. The deflection of the laser curtain sent a digital signal that was interpreted by central computer software. ## Results At week 2 post-nerve surgery, the average amplitude observed for group 1 and 2 was 4.4 and 10.8 degrees, respectively. At week 4, group 1 showed improvement with an average amplitude of 9.7 degrees, while group 2 displayed an average of 10.2 degrees. The week 6 results showed the greatest improvement from baseline for group 1. Group 1 and 2 had average amplitudes of 17.2 and 6.9 degrees, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after facial nerve surgery (*p*  > 0.05). ## Conclusions We found no statistical difference between these two locations of nerve repair using identical methods. Therefore, the authors recommend a single versus multiple nerve repair technique. This finding has potential implications for future facial allograft transplantations and at minimum necessitates further study with long-term follow-up data. # Results All animals tolerated the surgical procedure very well. They exhibited normal cage behavior and did not lose weight. Three animals had problems with suture break down post-operatively. This occurred in all 3 animals within 5 days of the surgical procedure. For these animals, we re-anesthetized them with isoflurane and were able to re-approximate the incision edges with 3--0 vicryl sutures. No animals had to be removed from the study. All animals experienced complete ipsilateral loss of whisking amplitude post-operatively. At week 2 the average amplitude observed for group 1 was 4.4 degrees (Table [1](#)). Similarly, the group 2 average was 10.8 degrees at 2 weeks post-operatively. At week 4, group 1 showed improvement having an average of 9.7 degrees, while group 2 remained relatively unchanged with an average of 10.2 degrees. The week 6 results showed the greatest improvement from baseline for group 1. Group 1 had an average amplitudes of 17.2 degrees at 6-weeks from surgery (Fig. [8](#)). However, group 2 showed a slight decrease in amplitude with an average of 5.9 degrees. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after facial nerve surgery (p > 0.05). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objective: The objective of this study is to examine the impact of vary doses of buprenorphine on anxiety symptoms in opioid-dependent inpatients over a 7 days period, using a randomized controlled trial design. ## Design: Patients were randomized to three groups. ## Patients and Methods: Fourteen men who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria for both opioid use disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and were seeking for treatment. ## Intervention: Patients obtain dosages of 32 mg or 64 mg or 96 mg of buprenorphine as a single dose only and were treated in a psychiatric inpatient unit. Of 14 subjects; 5 (35.7%) obtained 32 mg, 4 (28.6%) obtained 64 mg, and 5 (35.7%) obtained 96 mg of buprenorphine. ## Measurements: Administering daily Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and interview. ## Results: All the patients ended the 7-day treatment time. The results showed a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms within each of the three groups ( *P* = 0.00), but no difference in outcome between the groups ( *P* = 0.605). ## Conclusions: The outcome suggests a single high dose of buprenorphine can supply a speedy, safe, simple, and suitable means of anxiety treatment. The single high dose of buprenorphine could be a novel mechanism medication that provides a rapid and sustained improvement for generalized anxiety disorder in opioid dependent patients. Placebo-controlled trials of longer duration are needed to evaluate ability, safety, and psychological and physiological influence of extended exposure to this medication. # RESULTS All the 14 inpatients completed the 7-day period study. Hence, the data were gathered from 14 male opioid dependents whose mean age was 31.87 ± 8.15 year; with age range of 17--48 years. Out of 14 patients; 5 (35.7%) obtained 32 mg, 4 (28.6%) obtained 64 mg and also 5 (35.7%) obtained 96 mg of buprenorphine. Regarding marital status, age, education, and employment, we could not find any statistically significant differences in groups. [Table 1](#)demonstrates demographic features of the patients.

      "# Abstract ## Background Spinal fusion surgery is associated with significant blood loss, which may result in potential clinical complications, it is necessary to take safe and effective measures to reduce blood loss in surgery. We perform this study to assess the impact of three different hemostatic materials on perioperative blood loss. ## Methods We performed a Randomized Controlled Trial research and recruited patients with lumbar disease into the study between November 2013 and March 2015. All the participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups using a simple equal probability randomization scheme: Group A (Stypro hemostatic sponge), Group B (Collagen hemostatic sponge) and Group C (gelatin sponge). We compared postoperative blood loss between these 3 groups. ## Results In our study, drainage volume in the first 24 h of patients in Group A and B is significantly smaller, as well as total postoperative volumes of drainage (*p* < 0.05) during their hospital stay. The drainage volumes in the second 24 h were similar in the 3 groups. We also found that the average drainage Hematocrit (HCT) reduced over time, the average HCT of drainage is 18.04% and 11.72% on the first day and on the second day respectively. ## Conclusions Hemostatic collagen sponge demonstrated better hemostasis effects than gelatin sponge with lower volume of postoperative drainage volume and blood loss in posterior spinal fusion surgery. ## Trial registration The trial registration number (TRN) of the study is [ISRCTN29254316](#) and date of registration is 25/10/2016. Our trial was registered retrospectively. # Results In this study, 92 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Among these patients, 30 patients were assigned to group A, 30 patients were assigned to group B and 32 patients were assigned to group C. No significant difference in age, height, weight, BMI, surgical level, intraoperative blood loss, operative durations, the mean length of hospital stay and coagulation indices were identified between the 3 groups, as presented in Table [1](#). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background New graduates report intense stress during the transition from school to their first work settings. Managing this transition is important to reduce turnover rates. This study compared the effects of an externship program and a corporate-academic cooperation program on enhancing junior college students' nursing competence and retention rates in the first 3 months and 1 year of initial employment*.* ## Methods This two-phase study adopted a pretest and posttest quasi-experimental design. All participants were graduating students drawn from a 5-year junior nursing college in Taiwan. There were 19 and 24 students who participated in the phase I externship program and phase II corporate-academic cooperation program, respectively. The nursing competence of the students had to be evaluated by mentors within 48 hours of practicum training and after practicum training. The retention rate was also surveyed at 3 months and 1 year after beginning employment. ## Results Students who participated in the corporate-academic cooperation program achieved a statistically significant improvement in nursing competence and retention rates relative to those who participated in the externship program (*p <* 0.01 and *p <* 0.05, respectively). ## Conclusions The corporate-academic cooperation program facilitates the transition of junior college nursing students into independent staff nurses, enhances their nursing competence, and boosts retention rates. # Results ## Baseline characteristics of hospitals and mentors In the EP and CACP groups, 19 and 24 students were enrolled and 19 and 23 students completed the programs, respectively. At baseline, the hospital characteristics and demographics of the mentors in the 2 groups were examined by chi-squared analysis and independent t-tests to ensure homogeneity. Table [1](#) shows that there were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the 2 groups. However, 39.5% and 60.5% of the graduating students were placed at the medical center and regional teaching hospitals for the practicum, respectively. Most students were trained in medical wards (51.2%). Forty-three RNs participated in this program as mentors and were characterized as follows: mean age of 28.86 years (SD= 2.51), most were college-educated (33, 76.8%) and single (29, 67.5%), and the average number of working years as a nurse and average tenure in the present ward were 6.28 and 5.47 years, respectively. ::::table-wrap\n",

Most mentors agreed that students had achieved the \"can do much\" level for the nursing competence questionnaire. Table [2](#) shows that the CACP group achieved higher scores than the EP group following practicum training (T1) across all 6 subscales. For further comparisons, we used the baseline levels of the 6 nursing competence subscales as covariates for control the baseline variation of 2 groups. The MANCOVA test revealed a significant difference in the mean scores of the EP and CACP groups across the 6 subscales at T1 (Wilks' lambda: *F* = 4.000, d.f. = 6, *p* = 0.005), and a comparison of the mean scores for every subscale at T1 revealed significant differences between the 2 groups: CC (*p* = 0.005), T/C (*p* = 0.000), P/E (*p* = 0.000), IPR/C (*p* = 0.000), PD (*p* = 0.002) and leadership (*p* = 0.000). Furthermore, based on pairwise MANCOVA comparisons with the baseline levels of the 6 nursing competence subscales applied as covariates, the mean difference of CACP and EP groups at T1 (e.g., differences in total nursing competence scores, including all 6 subscale scores in these 2 groups at T1) also showed significant differences (Table [2](#), the last column), and the power of the study to detect the multivariate effect of 2 trial groups was 0.933. Besides, we also noted that group discrepancy was apparent in the \"top 3\" ranking in terms of percentage of change (i.e., the mean difference of T1-T0 divided by the total subscale score) across the 6 subscales. In the EP group, the T/C, P/E and CC subscales showed the highest improvement; however, the \"top 3\" rankings in the CACP group were the P/E, IPR/C and CC subscales. ## Group comparison of retention rate The retention rate declined over time in both groups. After practicum training, 19 students (100%) remained in the EP group and 23 (95.8%) remained in the CACP group, and most of the students were engaged in a clinical job. However, as time passed, more students chose to leave their first hospital of employment. In the EP group, 10 students remained in the hospital for 3 months after beginning employment, and only 8 students remained employed 1 year after beginning employment. Three months and 1 year after beginning employment, the retention rates were 52.6% and 42.1% for the EP group and 91.7% and 79.2% for the CACP group, respectively. Over time, the retention rate in the CACP group was significantly higher than that in the EP group (Table [3](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background: Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty is the gold standard therapeutic approach to ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). Use of a drainage method to protect the suture line from leakage is a matter of controversy. ## Objectives: We have compared the surgical outcome of Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty for UPJO repair, with or without internal stenting. ## Patients and Methods: Eighty-two patients with UPJO were evaluated from 1996 to 2002. Complicated or emergent cases were excluded. Classic standard dismembered pyeloplasty was performed. Internal drainage, with a double j catheter, was performed in several patients, randomly. Another drain was also placed in the retroperitoneal space. The follow-up of patients was planned weekly, with patient visits and urine analysis and intravenous pyelography (IVP) and diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) scan after one month. ## Results: The study group consisted of 51 male and 31 female patients, who were mostly in the age range of 20 - 40 years. Comparing the two techniques of pyeloplasty with or without internal drainage, there was no significant difference between groups regarding extravasation and anastomosis complications, such as leakage, stenosis, urinoma formation or evidence of obstruction on postoperative IVP or DTPA scan. However, a higher incidence of catheter related urinary symptoms and flank pain was reported among those with internal stent. ## Conclusions: Pyeloplasty, with adequate spatulation, hemostasis and a watertight anastomosis, represents the mainstay of successful pyeloplasty and there may be no significant benefit for urethral stenting, especially in non-complicated cases. # 4. Results Double stenting was used in 30 cases and pyeloplasty without internal drainage was performed in 52 patients. Both groups were similar in age and sex distribution. The most common symptom was severe flank pain, which was present in 69% of patients. History of urinary tract infection was detected in 47% and 51% reported associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Pyuria was seen in 58% and only 36% of patients had positive urine culture, with *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) as the most common pathogen (60%). The preoperative sonographic evaluation and IVP results are shown in [Table 1](#). Intraoperative assessments showed ureteropelvic junction segmental atresia in 45 cases and aberrant vessels in 25 patients. The postoperative course was compared in two groups of patients, with and without internal drainage ([Table 2](#)). Among patients with extravasation in DTPA scan in the stent free group, retrograde DJ stent was inserted in four cases that had unacceptable drainage due to inflammation. One patient had distal ureter obstruction because of distal ureter stone, that was treated by Trans-ureteral lithotripsy (TULP) and stent support. Three other cases had no anatomical abnormality, and they were followed and extravasation resolved spontaneously at control IVP after one month. Removal of DJ stent was planned in one month after operation. However, eight cases missed the time and late stent removal was accompanied with several complications, such as stone formation on the tip of catheter in the bladder of a patient that needed TULP before stent removal. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Low-dose haloperidol is known to be effective for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). However, precise dose-response studies have not been completed, especially in patients at high risk for PONV who require combination therapy. This study sought to identify which dose of haloperidol 1mg or 2mg could be combined with dexamethasone without adverse effects in high-risk patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery. ## Methods Female adults (*n* = 150) with three established PONV risk factors based on Apfel's score were randomized into one of three study groups. At the end of anesthesia, groups H0, H1, and H2 were given intravenous (IV) saline, haloperidol 1 mg, and haloperidol 2 mg, respectively. All patients were given dexamethasone 5 mg during the induction of anesthesia. The overall early (0--2 h) and late (2--24 h) incidences of nausea, vomiting, rescue anti-emetic administration, pain, and adverse effects (cardiac arrhythmias and extrapyramidal effects) were assessed postoperatively. The sedation score was recorded in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). ## Results The total incidence of PONV over 24 h was significantly lower in groups H1 (29 %) and H2 (24 %) than in group H0 (54 %; *P* = 0.003), but there was no significant difference between groups H1 and H2. In the PACU, group H2 had a higher sedation score than groups H1 and H0 (*P* < 0.001). ## Conclusions For high-risk PONV patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery, when used with dexamethasone, 1-mg haloperidol was equally effective as 2 mg in terms of preventing PONV with the less sedative effect. ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov ([NCT01639599](#)). # Results Of the 150 patients registered for the study, one was excluded due to an intra-operative conversion to laparotomy (Fig. [1](#)). The remaining 149 patients, consisting of 50, 49, and 50 patients in groups H0, H1, and H2, respectively, completed the study. The patient characteristics, PONV risk factors, type of surgery, duration of anesthesia, intra-operative remifentanil use, 24-h postoperative PCA fentanyl use, postoperative pain severity, and rescue analgesic requirements were similar among the three groups (Table [1](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>CONSORT diagram showing the flow of participants</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objective Internet-delivered interventions can effectively change health risk behaviors and their determinants, but adherence to intervention websites once they are accessed is very low. This study tests whether and how social presence elements can increase website use. ## Methods A website about Hepatitis A, B, and C virus infections was used in a preparatory lab-based eye-tracking study assessing whether social presence elements attract participants' attention, because this is a prerequisite for affecting website use. In the following field study, 482 participants representative of the Dutch population were randomized to either a website with or a website without social presence elements. Participants completed a questionnaire of validated measures regarding user perceptions immediately after exposure to the website. Server registrations were used to assess website use. ## Results Participants in the experimental condition focused on the social presence elements, both in terms of frequency (*F*(1, 98) = 40.34, *p*<.001) and duration (*F*(1, 88) = 39.99, *p*<.001), but did not differ in website use in comparison with the control condition; neither in terms of the number of pages visited (*t*(456) = 1.44, *p* = .15), nor in terms of time on the website (*t*(456) = 0.01, *p* = .99). ## Conclusions Adding social presence elements did not affect actual use of an intervention website within a public health context. Possible reasons are limited attention for these elements in comparison with the main text and the utilitarian value of intervention websites. # Results ## Participants Of those 982 potential participants that were invited, 458 participated in the study (47%). Half of the participants were female and the mean age of participants was 49 years (*SD* = 16). Of the participants, 30% had a low level of highest completed education (equivalent to primary school/junior high school), 38% an intermediate level (equivalent to senior high school/junior college), and 32% a high level (equivalent to college/university). Those 458 that participated were invited to complete the follow-up measure and 402 of them did so (88%). There was no selective dropout regarding gender (χ2 (1, N = 458) = 0.3, *p* = .57), level of education (χ2 = 5.0, *p* = .08), or Hepatitis knowledge at baseline (*t*(456) = 1.83, *p* = .07). Furthermore, dropout did not differ between the two conditions (χ2 (1, N = 458) = 3.2, *p* = .08). Those who dropped out, however, were younger (*M* = 43 vs 50 years, (*t*(456) = 3.19, *p* = .002). ## Manipulation check Participants in the experimental condition scored higher on perceived social presence than the control condition (*M* = 4.9 vs. 4.4, *t*(456) = 4.11, *p*<.001, Cohen's d = 0.38), which indicates that the manipulation did succeed. This effect can be classified as small. ## Website use and Hepatitis knowledge Participants in the experimental condition did not differ in website use in comparison with the control condition; neither in terms of the number of pages visited, nor in terms of time on the website ([Table 1](#)). Effect sizes were trivial. Thus, there is no support for Hypothesis 1. The increase in Hepatitis knowledge between pre-test and post-test did not differ between both conditions (*F*(1, 400) = 0.72, *p* = .40), but there was a significant increase regarding Hepatitis knowledge between pre-test and post-test across conditions (*M* = 6.4 vs. 8.3, *F*(1,400) = 172.98, *p*<.001, Cohen's d = 0.65), which can be defined as a moderate effect size. ::::table-wrap\n",

[Figure 5](#) illustrates the final structural equation model testing the associations between user perceptions and website use across conditions, because there were no differences on both measures of website use. The final model is mostly in line with Hypothesis 2: Efficiency (*M* = 6.5, *SD* = 0.84), effectiveness (*M* = 6.4, *SD* = 0.87), and enjoyment (*M* = 5.6, *SD* = 1.21) were positively associated with website use and these associations were partly mediated by active trust (*M* = 5.8, *SD* = 1.23). The association between efficiency and website use, however, was fully mediated by active trust. Since there were no differences between conditions in terms of website use, there is neither support for Hypothesis 3a nor for Hypothesis 3b. Interest (*M* = 5.9, *SD* = 1.06), however, was positively associated with and contributed to explaining variance in website use besides efficiency, effectiveness, enjoyment, and active trust. The explained variance (R^2^) of the number of pages visited and time on the website is .63 and .51 respectively. The CFI and TLI are .98 and .97, respectively; RMSEA and SRMR are .06 and .04, respectively. All of these fit indices indicate a close fit for the final model. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0057067.g005 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Final model including standardized betas of significant paths within the model.</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "# Abstract Cervical degenerative disease is one of the most common spinal disorders worldwide, especially in older people. Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) is a useful method for the surgical treatment of multi-level cervical degenerative disease. Anterior cervical disc replacement (ACDR) is considered as an alternative surgical method. However, both methods have drawbacks, particularly the neck motion decrease observed after arthrodesis, and arthroplasty should only be performed on patients presenting with cervical disc disease but without any vertebral body disease. Therefore, we designed a non-fusion cervical joint system, namely an artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC), to provide a novel treatment for multi-level cervical degenerative disease. To enhance the long-term stability of ACVC, we applied a hydroxyapatite (HA) biocoating on the surface of the artificial joint. Thirty-two goats were randomly divided into four groups: a sham control group, an ACVC group, an ACVC-HA group, and an ACCF group (titanium and plate fixation group). We performed the prosthesis implantation in our previously established goat model. We compared the clinical, radiological, biomechanical, and histological outcomes among these four different groups for 24 weeks post surgery. The goats successfully tolerated the entire experimental procedure. The kinematics data for the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups were similar. The range of motion (ROM) in adjacent level increased after ACCF but was not altered after ACVC or ACVC-HA implantation. Compared with the control group, no significant difference was found in ROM and neutral zone (NZ) in flexion-extension or lateral bending for the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups, whereas the ROM and NZ in rotation were significantly greater. Compared with the ACCF group, the ROM and NZ significantly increased in all directions. Overall, stiffness was significantly decreased in the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups compared with the control group and the ACCF group. Similar results were found after a fatigue test of 5,000 repetitions of axial rotation. The histological results showed more new bone formation and better bone implant contact in the ACVC-HA group than the ACVC group. Goat is an excellent animal model for cervical spine biomechanical study. Compared with the intact state and the ACCF group, ACVC could provide immediate stability and preserve segmental movement after discectomy and corpectomy. Besides, HA biocoating provide a better bone ingrowth, which is essential for long-term stability. In conclusion, ACVC-HA brings new insight to treat cervical degenerative disease. # Results ## Design of different artificial cervical joints [Fig 1](#) shows photographs of the ACVC ([Fig 1B](#)), the ACVC-HA ([Fig 1C](#)), and the titanium cage and the anterior plate ([Fig 1D](#)) implants. The ball-in-trough structure ([Fig 1A-7 and 1A-8](#)) is the most important part of this unconstrained metal-on-metal ACVC joint. In theory, the ball-in-trough articulation allows a 20° ROM in flexion-extension, a 12° ROM in lateral bending, a 360° ROM in rotation, and a 1.5-mm anterior-posterior slide horizontally. The ACVC-HA is an ACVC treated with a 30-μm hydroxyapatite biocoating via microarc oxidation technology. The titanium cage and the anterior plate were used for goat anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. The titanium cage was 8 mm wide and could be cut to a suitable length. Because the vertebral bodies of goats are much longer than those of humans, four to eight screws could be used to fix the plate and the cage. The vertebral components were hollow-structured, which allowed the surgeons to implant the autologous bone in the hollow space. Thus, the surrounding bone could grow into the vertebral components through the holes, this providing long-term stability. ## Clinical and radiological assessments of the different prosthesis implantations in goats All surgeries were successful. Surgery time, blood loss, recovery time, and time before eating are shown in [Table 1](#). No significant differences were found in surgery time, blood loss, recovery time, and time before eating among ACVC, ACVC-HA, and ACCF groups. These findings indicate that ACVC or ACVC-HA implantation did not increase surgery time, blood loss, recovery time, and time before eating compared with the ACCF group. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "groups.:::: The goats tolerated the artificial joints very well during the experiment. All goats survived until 24 weeks after surgery. No abnormal neurological reflexes or neurological complications were found. One goat in the ACVC group and two goats in the ACCF group developed wound infections 8 to 12 days after surgery. These wound infections were cured by applying antibiotics and changing bandages daily. One goat in the ACVC-HA group and another goat in the ACCF group suffered respiratory infections and recovered by using antibiotics. No bone fracture, joint dislocation, or screw loosening were found during the experimental period. [Fig 2](#) shows the CT images of goats in the three different groups 24 weeks after surgery. In the ACVC group, the implant was properly located in the C3 vertebral body ([Fig 2B](#)). The vertebral body component of the ACVC was located in the middle of the C3 vertebral body ([Fig 2E](#)). The two lower screws were fixed to the C4 vertebral body ([Fig 2H](#)). The titanium cage was located between C2 and C4. The vertebral bodies from C2 to C4 were fixed by the plate ([Fig 2C](#)). The titanium cage was located in the trough of the C3 vertebral body ([Fig 2F](#)). The anterior plate was fixed by 3 screws to the C2 vertebral body and by 3 additional screws to the C4 vertebral body ([Fig 2I](#)). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0178775.g002 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>CT images of goats in control group, ACVC group, ACCF group 24 weeks after the surgery (ACVC and ACVC-HA appears similar).<br /> A, B, C, Lateral views of C2 to C4 for the three groups; D, G, transverse views of C3 and C4 vertebral bodies in control group; E, H, transverse views of C3 and C4 vertebral bodies in ACVC group; F, I, transverse views of C3 and C4 vertebral bodies in ACCF group.</figcaption> </figure> ## Biomechanical results of the different prosthesis implantations in goats To investigate the cervical spine ROM separately, we used the three-dimensional laser optoelectronic camera system ([Table 2](#)).

The rotation ROM of the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups were greater than the ROM of the control group for the C2-C6 and C2-C4 segments. Accordingly, the ROM in rotation decreased in the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups for the C4-C5 and C5-C6 segments. For the C2-C6 and C2-C4 segments, the ROM was less for the ACCF group than for the control group in all three directions. Accordingly, the ROM of the C4-C5 segment in all three directions and the ROM of the C5-C6 segment in rotation increased in the ACCF group. ::::table-wrap\n",

In the sections located at the ACVC vertebral body component level ([Fig 8A and 8C](#)), we found less new bone formation and more fibrous tissue around the implant for the ACVC group ([Fig 8A](#)) than for the ACVC-HA group ([Fig 8C](#)). In the sections located at the self-drilling fixation screw level ([Fig 8E and 8G](#)), we found significantly more new bone formation around the screws for the ACVC-HA group ([Fig 8G](#)) than for the ACVC group ([Fig 8E](#)). Moreover, the ACVC group had much more fibrous tissue around the screws than the ACVC-HA group. These findings indicate that, compared with the ACVC group, the ACVC-HA group had a significantly higher bone-implant contact (BIC) in both sections respectively located at the vertebral body component and screw level ([Fig 8I](#)), which is an appropriate index for measuring bone ingrowth into the implant. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0178775.g008 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Comparison histological images of ACVC and ACVC-HA.<br /> A and B, 25X- and 100X- magnified images at the level of ACVC vertebral body component; C and D, 25X- and 100X- magnified images at the level of ACVC-HA vertebral body component; E and F, 25X- and 100X- magnified images at the level of fixation screws of ACVC; G and H, 25X- and 100X- magnified images at the level of fixation screws of ACVC-HA; I, Bone implant contact (BIC) of ACVC and ACVC-HA at vertebral body and screw level.</figcaption> </figure> The magnified images showed that bone formation around the implant surfaces was fragmentary and that a large portion of the bone tissue was separated from the implant surface by soft tissue in the ACVC group ([Fig 8B and 8F](#)).

      "# Abstract ## Background: The radical surgical procedures are associated with perioperative blood loss. This study was aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in reducing perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing radical surgery. ## Materials and Methods: Sixty ASA class I and II adult consented female patients, scheduled for elective radical surgery and met the inclusion criterion, were blindly randomized into two groups to receive either intravenous 1 g tranexamic acid 20 min before skin incision or an equivalent volume of normal saline as placebo (P). All patient's total blood loss was measured and recorded perioperatively at the 12^th^h postoperatively. The preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, hematocrit values, serum creatinine, activated thromboplastin time, prothombin time, thrombocyte count, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and symptoms of pulmonary embolism were comparatively evaluated. ## Results: The tranexamic acid significantly reduced the quantity of total blood loss, 576 ± 53 mL in study group as compared to 823 ± 74 mL in the control group (*P*<0.01). Postoperatively hematocrit values were higher in the tranexamic acid group. The coagulation profile did not differ between the groups, but D-dimer concentrations were increased in the control group. No complications or adverse effects were reported in the either group. ## Conclusion: The prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid has effectively reduced theblood loss and transfusion needs during radical surgery without any adverse effects or complication of thrombosis. # RESULTS There was no significant difference in demographic data between groups. No significant difference was present between groups in mean hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, fibrinogen values, and coagulation parameters. All radical surgeries were done under general anesthesia and standardized anesthetic technique was used for all patients of both groups [[Table 1](#)]. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract Hepatitis C virus genotype 2 (HCV-2) slow responders poorly respond to 24 weeks of peginterferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). We evaluated the efficacy of extended 48-week regimen and the role of interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype in this clinical setting. Treatment-naïve HCV-2 patients not achieving rapid virologic response (RVR) by Peg-IFN alfa-2a 180 μg/week plus weight-based RBV (1,000--1,200 mg/day, cutoff body weight of 75 kg) were randomly assigned to receive a total duration of 48 (n = 94) or 24 (n = 93) weeks of therapy. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR). Baseline patient characteristics to predict SVR were analyzed. Patients receiving 48 weeks of treatment had a greater SVR rate than those receiving 24 weeks of treatment (70.2% versus 46.2%, *P* = 0.001). Compared to patients treated for 24 weeks, the SVR rate in those treated for 48 weeks increased by 10.9% [95% CI: −5.9% to 27.7%] and 65.6% [95% CI: 44.5% to 86.7%] if they had IL-28B rs8099917 TT genotype, and GT/GG genotype, respectively (interaction *P* = 0.002). In conclusion, 48-week treatment with Peg-IFN plus weight-based RBV provides a greater SVR rate than 24-week treatment in treatment-naïve HCV-2 patients with unfavorable IL-28B genotypes who fail to achieve RVR. # Results ## Patient Characteristics Among the 190 patients not achieving RVR by Peg-IFN plus weight-based RBV therapy, 187 were allocated to a total duration of 48-week (n = 94) or 24-week (n = 93) therapy. Seventy-four (78.7%) and 80 (86.0%) patients assigned to 48-week and 24-week therapies completed treatment, and 87 (92.6%) and 88 (94.6%) patients completed 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up to assess the SVR rates ([Fig. 1](#)). The baseline patient characteristics were comparable between the two arms ([Table 1](#)).They were slim with an average BMI of 26.3--26.7 kg/m^2^.Most of the patients had high baseline viral load (62--65%) and favorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotype (71--74%), and were infected with 2a subtype (68--71%). With regard to aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score, 23.7--27.7% patients had a score of >2.00. ## Efficacy The early virologic response (EVR) (91.5% versus 88.2%, RD: 3.3% [95% CI: −5.3% to 12.0%]; *P* = 0.45) and the end-of-treatment virologic response (ETVR) (88.3% versus 80.6%, RD: 7.7% [95% CI: −2.7% to 18.0%]; *P* = 0.15) rates were comparable between the treatment arms. The SVR rate of 48-week treatment was greater than 24-week treatment (70.2% versus 46.2%, RD: 24.0% [95% CI: 10.3% to 37.7%]; *P* = 0.001) ([Table 2](#)). Patients with RBV cumulative exposure <60% had lower SVR rates than those with RBV cumulative exposure ≥60% in 48-week arm (77.6% versus 38.9%, *P *= 0.003) and 24-week arm (53.8% versus 6.7%, *P *= 0.001), respectively. ## Subgroup Analyses for Prespecified Factors Differences of SVR rates between patients receiving 48 and 24 weeks of treatment did not vary by baseline viral load (interaction *P* = 0.82), subgenotype (interaction *P* = 0.89), age (interaction *P* = 0.73), sex (interaction *P* = 0.94), body mass index (BMI) (interaction *P* = 0.26), APRI score (interaction *P* = 0.83) or RBV cumulative exposure (interaction *P *= 0.48) ([Table 3](#)). Compared to patients with favorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotype (69.2% versus 58.3%, risk difference (RD): 10.9% [95% CI: −5.9% to 27.7%]), patients with unfavorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotypes receiving 48-week therapy achieved a greater SVR rate than 24-week therapy (73.9% versus 8.3%, RD: 65.6% [95% CI: 44.5% to 86.7%]; interaction *P* = 0.002). The SVR rates of 48-week and 24-week treatment were similar when the patients had BMI >30 kg/m^2^ (52.6% versus 50.0%, RD: 2.6% [95% CI: −33.5% to 38.8%]). ## Safety The constitutional and laboratory adverse events (AEs) were similar between the two arms ([Table 4](#)). Four and 3 patients in 48-week and 24-week arms had serious AEs during treatment (4.3% versus 3.2%, RD: 1.1% [95% CI: −4.4% to 6.5%]. The AE-related withdrawal rates were 11.7% in 48-week treatment arm and 6.5% in 24-week treatment arm (RD: 5.2% [95% CI: 2.9% to 13.5%]). The rates of anemia beyond week 6 of treatment were 44.7% and 34.4% (RD: 10.3% [95% CI: −3.7% to 24.2%]. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Study Flow Diagram.

      "# Abstract ## Background Duloxetine, Etoricoxib and opioid are of the commonly administered drugs in Lumbar laminectomy. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of perioperative use of Duloxetine in combination with Etoricoxib on postoperative pain and opioid requirements. ## Methods One hundred twenty patients with ASA physical status were enrolled with age between 18 and 70 years. Patients were divided randomly into four groups of 30 patients: group P received placebo, group E received etoricoxib 120 mg, group D received duloxetine 60 mg and group D/E received duloxetine 60 mg capsules and etoricoxib 120 mg; 1 h before surgery and 24 h after. ## Results Neither Duloxetine nor etoricoxib individually had effect on pain with movement, while their combination revealed a significant reduction in pain scores over the entire postoperative period at rest and on movement. Etoricoxib showed a significant decrease in pain at all times at rest when compared with group P, while it showed significant pain decrease only at 0, 2 and 4 h when compared with group D. On the other hand duloxetine alone showed significant decrease in pain at rest at 24 h and 48 h when compared with group P. ConcerningMorphine requirement after 24 h.; it wassignificantly lower in the D/E group in comparison with groups P, E and D. It should be noted also that there was a significant decrease morphine requirement in both groups E and D. ## Conclusion The perioperative administration of the combination of etoricoxib and duloxetine improved analgesia and reduced opioid consumption without significant side effects. ## Trial registration [ ISRCTN48329522](#). 17 June 2017 # Results From November 1, 2015 to March 1, 2017, 131 consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria were allocated for the study (Fig. [1](#)). Eleven patients refused to participate. Therefore, 120 patients were randomized and included in the study. Characteristics of patients and surgical procedures for each group (Table [ 1](#)) showed no significant differences between the groups. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow diagram for participant</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Poor sanitation is thought to be a major cause of enteric infections among young children. However, there are no previously published randomized trials to measure the health impacts of large-scale sanitation programs. India's Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) is one such program that seeks to end the practice of open defecation by changing social norms and behaviors, and providing technical support and financial subsidies. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of the TSC implemented with capacity building support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program in Madhya Pradesh on availability of individual household latrines (IHLs), defecation behaviors, and child health (diarrhea, highly credible gastrointestinal illness [HCGI], parasitic infections, anemia, growth). ## Methods and Findings We conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in 80 rural villages. Field staff collected baseline measures of sanitation conditions, behaviors, and child health (May--July 2009), and revisited households 21 months later (February--April 2011) after the program was delivered. The study enrolled a random sample of 5,209 children <5 years old from 3,039 households that had at least one child <24 months at the beginning of the study. A random subsample of 1,150 children <24 months at enrollment were tested for soil transmitted helminth and protozoan infections in stool. The randomization successfully balanced intervention and control groups, and we estimated differences between groups in an intention to treat analysis. The intervention increased percentage of households in a village with improved sanitation facilities as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme by an average of 19% (95% CI for difference: 12%--26%; group means: 22% control versus 41% intervention), decreased open defecation among adults by an average of 10% (95% CI for difference: 4%--15%; group means: 73% intervention versus 84% control). However, the intervention did not improve child health measured in terms of multiple health outcomes (diarrhea, HCGI, helminth infections, anemia, growth). Limitations of the study included a relatively short follow-up period following implementation, evidence for contamination in ten of the 40 control villages, and bias possible in self-reported outcomes for diarrhea, HCGI, and open defecation behaviors. ## Conclusions The intervention led to modest increases in availability of IHLs and even more modest reductions in open defecation. These improvements were insufficient to improve child health outcomes (diarrhea, HCGI, parasite infection, anemia, growth). The results underscore the difficulty of achieving adequately large improvements in sanitation levels to deliver expected health benefits within large-scale rural sanitation programs. ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01465204](#) *Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary* # Results ## Enrolment, Baseline Balance, and Attrition [Figure 2](#) depicts the study participants flow. The baseline survey enrolled a sample of 3,390 children <5 years from 1,954 households from 80 villages. In the follow-up survey the sample size was increased to 5,209 children <5 years from 3,039 households. As reported in [Table 2](#), baseline covariates in intervention and control groups were well balanced with four exceptions. First, 89% of the households in the intervention group had access to improved water sources---tap/piped water, tube well and protected dug wells---compared to 80% of households in the control group. In contrast, a larger proportion of control households (54%) were observed to have soap and water at hand-washing locations used after defecation than in intervention households (44%). On average, more children were found to be anemic in the control group (93%) than in the intervention group (88%). Finally, average height-for-age Z-scores were also slightly imbalanced (−1.38 intervention versus −1.81 control). ::::table-wrap\n",

Of the 1,954 households enrolled at the baseline, 1,655 were located at the 21-month follow-up survey (15% attrition) without any significant difference between the intervention (16%) and the control (15%) groups. Characteristics remained balanced between intervention and control groups in remaining households. ## Compliance to Randomization The study measured intervention implementation in multiple ways because of the complexity of the TSC program. These measures included: reported implementation by Block coordinators, expenditure of funds documented by official program records, and interviews with local village officials. Out of 40 intervention villages, staff collected administrative information on 39 villages from the TSC Block coordinators (government officers). The coordinators reported that 15/39 intervention villages received some CLTS activities, 33/39 villages applied for a NGP award prior to the follow-up survey. According to Block coordinators' records, 25/39 villages had 100% households with IHLs, 11/39 villages had 80%--99% households with IHLs, and three of 39 villages with 37%--68% households with IHLs. Block coordinators also reported that 21/39 villages received 100% of the funds allocated under the TSC program, 12/39 villages received between 50% and 99%, and six of 39 villages received <50% of their allocated funds. The latest disbursement of the TSC funds was given to 36/39 intervention villages at least 4 to 5 months before the follow-up survey, which would offer sufficient time for IHLs to be constructed and used for 3 or more months. The study review meetings with Block coordinators also identified that some control villages were contaminated during the study period: TSC activities were initiated in eight control villages within a few months of baseline survey and possibly in two additional control villages a few months prior to the follow-up survey; official records were not available for control villages to ascertain this information objectively. As per the follow-up survey in these ten contaminated villages, the household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities increased from 17.4% at baseline to 41.4% at the follow-up, which is similar to the program effect we observed in the intervention group. The household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities in uncontaminated control villages increased from 10.7% to 16.2% in the same period. The study's long follow-up period (21 months) and the highly publicized and politicized nature of the TSC program may have contributed to this contamination. Information from additional sources (village secretaries, school teachers, *Anganwadi* [pre-school] workers in the village, and the rapid assessment from random sample of households) confirmed that TSC activities translated into a higher recollection and knowledge of the TSC program in the intervention villages compared to the control villages. We also found that households in intervention villages were more aware of CLTS activities, had higher knowledge of TSC, and experienced more personal visits to convince them to build and use IHLs ([Table 3](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "sanitation and hygiene.:::: ## IHL Coverage and Sanitation-Related Behaviors [Table 3](#) reports the intervention's effect on IHL availability (JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and any type of IHLs) and open defecation behaviors by household members. The intervention increased the coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facility by average 19 percentage points (95% CI 12%--26%; *p*-value<0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (41.4% intervention versus 22.6% control). The intervention increased the coverage of any type of IHL facility by 20 percentage points (95% CI 13%--27%; *p*-value<0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (44.1% intervention versus 24.2% control). These results indicate that available IHLs were predominantly JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and very few rudimentary latrines or latrines defined as unimproved by the JMP were built. These results are consistent with the TSC design that promoted latrine models that can safely contain the feces. Although on average fewer households in intervention villages were likely to report daily open defecation compared to control villages for adult men (75% intervention versus 84% control; mean difference: 9.5%; *p*-value = 0.001), adult women (73% intervention versus 83% control; mean difference: 10%; *p*-value<0.001), and children <5 years (84% intervention versus 89% control; mean difference: 5%; *p*-value = 0.014), these reductions in reported open defecation behaviors were smaller than the gains in IHL availability. Amongst the 630 households in intervention villages that had JMP defined improved sanitation facilities at follow-up, 41% reported that adult men or women still practiced daily open defecation; this same figure was 28% among the 339 control village households at follow-up (not reported in results table). A follow-up debriefing question to households who had IHL identified that the main reasons for daily open defecation in spite of having IHL were culture, habit, or preference for defecating in open followed by inadequate water availability. ## Drinking Water Quality In control villages, 82% (331/403) of household drinking water samples tested positive for *E. coli* compared to 77% (310/404) of samples in intervention villages (mean difference: 5.5%; *p*-value = 0.050) ([Table 3](#)). [Table S2](#) lists the distribution of positive household samples by different *E. coli* contamination level categories. Of 511 water source samples tested, 74% (208/280) of the sources in control villages and 70% (162/231) in intervention villages tested positive for *E. coli* but the difference was not statistically significant (*p*-value = 0.143). ## Caregiver Reported Illness Diarrhea prevalence did not differ between groups (7.4% intervention versus 7.7% control; *p*-value = 0.687) ([Table 4](#)). HCGI prevalence also did not differ between groups (11.5% intervention versus 12.0% control; *p*-value = 0.692) ([Table 4](#)). We observed no significant differences between groups in negative control caregiver-reported outcomes including bruising/abrasions (1.4% intervention versus 1.3% control) and itchy skin/scalp (2.5% intervention versus 2.2% control) suggesting that differential outcome reporting bias for diarrhea and HCGI was unlikely. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "defecation.:::: ## Enteric Parasite Infections In the subsample of 1,150 children with stool collection, 5.7% (66/1150) had helminth infections and the majority (50/66) were *Ascaris* infections. All remaining infections were tapeworms; no children were infected with *T. trichiura* or hookworm. We observed no difference in helminth prevalence between intervention and control groups. *Giardia* infection was common, and consistent with slightly improved water quality in the intervention group, we found lower *Giardia* prevalence among children in intervention villages (18%) compared to children in control villages (23%) (mean difference: 4.8%; *p*-value = 0.047). We detected no *Cryptosporidium* infections in the study children, and a low prevalence of *E. histolytica* (33 out of 1,150; 2.9%). ## Anemia and Anthropometry Anemia was prevalent in the study children (54%) and children were small according to international growth standards ([Table 4](#)). However, we found no differences between the randomized groups in anemia prevalence or growth outcomes. ## Subgroup Results [Table 5](#) presents the results of subgroup analyses of the effect of the intervention on households with or without any type of IHL at baseline and BPL or non-BPL households. As expected, the program had the largest improvements on JMP defined improved sanitation facilities, IHL use as assessed by enumerators, and reduced reported open defecation by household members in households that did not have IHL (any type) at baseline and in BPL households. This finding is consistent with the TSC design that targeted households without IHLs and offered larger IHL construction subsidies for BPL households. Among BPL households, the intervention increased JMP defined improved sanitation facilities coverage by 30 percentage points (48% intervention versus 18% control; *p*-value<0.001) and it reduced open defecation among women by 17 percentage points (73% intervention versus 90% control; *p*-value<0.001). Despite larger improvements in these intermediate outcomes among BPL households or households without IHL at baseline, we did not observe consistent improvement in health outcomes in these subgroups ([Table 5](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract Our aim was to study the expression of adipokine-encoding genes (leptin, adiponectin, and angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4)) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and adipokine concentration in cord blood from women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) depending on glycaemic targets. GDM patients were randomised to 2 groups per target glycaemic levels: GDM1 (tight glycaemic targets, fasting blood glucose < 5.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L postprandial, *N* = 20) and GDM2 (less tight glycaemic targets, <5.3 mmol/L and < 7.8 mmol/L, respectively, *N* = 21). The control group included 25 women with normal glucose tolerance. ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; *p* < 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2. The level of adiponectin gene expression was low and did not differ among the groups. Leptin gene expression was undetectable in HUVECs. In cord blood, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) was increased in GDM2 compared to controls and GDM1 ( *p* = 0.038) and did not differ between GDM1 and controls. Tight glycaemic targets were associated with normalisation of increased LAR in the cord blood. ANGPTL4 expression was downregulated in HUVECs of newborns from GDM mothers and was not affected by the intensity of glycaemic control. # 3. Results ## 3.1. Characteristics of the Participants Baseline characteristics of the participants are described in [Table 1](#) . The women from all three groups did not differ in terms of age and prepregnancy BMI. The GDM1 group had higher diastolic BP compared to controls ( *p* = 0.003). The GDM1 and GDM2 groups had higher levels of fasting PG ( *p* = 0.004 and *p* = 0.003, resp.) and higher levels of PG 1 h and 2 h in OGTT ( *p* < 0.001 in comparison with controls). Mean levels of fasting, 1-hour postprandial and average blood glucose measured by the participants during the study are described in [Table 2](#) . The GDM1 group achieved significantly lower average and 1-hour postprandial glucose levels compared to GDM2. Mean postprandial BG was lower in GDM1 even compared to the control group, though the difference did not reach statistical significance ( *p* = 0.088). Gestational weight gain did not differ between GDM1 and GDM2 groups and was lower in both groups compared to controls ( [Table 2](#) ). The percentage of women treated with insulin was 40% and 29% in the GDM1 and GDM2 groups, respectively, and did not significantly differ ( *p* = 0.495). ## 3.2. Pregnancy Outcomes Pregnancy outcomes and biochemical markers in cord blood are shown in [Table 3](#) . There was no statistically significant difference among the groups in terms of pregnancy outcomes (percent of large for gestational age (LGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) newborns, delivery by caesarean section) and the level of C-peptide, adiponectin, and ANGPTL4 in cord blood serum and glucose in cord blood plasma. The level of leptin in cord blood serum was higher in the GDM2 group than in the GDM1 ( *p* = 0.036) and the control group, but the difference from the control group did not reach statistical significance ( *p* = 0.066). After adjustment by insulin therapy, age, and prepregnancy BMI, the difference in the level of leptin between GDM1 and GDM2 remained significant ( *p* = 0.01). The leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) in cord blood serum was higher in the GDM2 group compared to controls ( *p* = 0.011) with no difference between the GDM1 and control group ( *p* = 0.404). ## 3.3. HUVEC Characterisation HUVECs were obtained from the umbilical vein, expanded in vitro, and characterised for expression of endothelial markers by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. All samples demonstrated characteristic endothelial morphology and immunophenotype CD45−/CD144+/CD31+/CD146+/CD105+ and stained positively for endothelial markers, von Willebrand factor, and CD146 (as demonstrated in our previous work [ [20](#) ]). There was no difference in the parameters of viability and replicative aging of HUVEC cultures from different patient groups (data not presented). ## 3.4. Gene Expression in HUVECs ANGPTL4 expression was downregulated in the HUVECs derived from GDM patients compared to control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 0.92, respectively, for GDM1, GDM2, and control groups; *p* < 0.001 for comparison among the 3 groups) while no difference between GDM1 and GDM2 groups was observed ( [Figure 1(a)](#) ). We did not detect the expression of LEP in HUVEC but found out that they expressed LEPR, and the expression of LEPR demonstrated a decline in the GDM1/GDM2 groups compared to the control group, though the differences were not statistically significant ( [Figure 1(c)](#) ). The expression of LEPR did not correlate with the level of LEP in cord plasma ( [Figure 1(d)](#) ) which indicates that there is no reciprocal regulation between LEP and its receptor in HUVECs. The expression of ADIPOQ was detected in HUVEC samples, but the level of its expression was as low as in negative control samples and lower by four orders of magnitude in HUVEC compared to adipocytes (positive control) ( [Figure 1(b)](#) ). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GDM 1 GDM2 Control *p* ( *N* = 20) ( *N* = 21) ( *N* = 25) --------------------------------------- ----------------- ----------------- -------------- ------- Gestational age at delivery, weeks 39.2 ± 1.5 39.3 ± 1.0 39.7 ± 1.0 0.261 Caesarean section, % ( *N* ) 30% (6) 19% (4) 20% (5) 0.723 Birth weight, g 3572 ± 488 3584 ± 577 3513 ± 555 0.856 Height, cm 52.1 ± 2.5 52.4 ± 2.3 52.1 ± 2.5 0.990 LGA, % ( *N* ) 20% (4) 23% (5) 12% (3) 0.235 SGA, % ( *N* ) 5% (1) 9.5% (2) 4% (1) 0.819 Apgar score 1 min 7.5 ± 0.7 7.7 ± 1.1 7.7 ± 0.6 0.204 Apgar score 5 min 8.6 ± 0.5 8.7 ± 0.9 8.8 ± 0.4 0.208 Glucose, mmol/L 4.7 ± 1.2 5.3 ± 1.3 4.5 ± 1.2 0.203 C-peptide, ng/mL 0.8 ± 0.5 1.0 ± 0.6 0.9 ± 0.4 0.379 Leptin, ng/mL 8.8 ± 6.6 ^a^ 18.3 ± 16.1 10.6 ± 10.4 0.042 Adiponectin, ng/mL 15.9 ± 11.5 16.3 ± 14.4 18.3 ± 14.3 0.843 LAR 0.97 ± 1.31 1.70 ± 1.66 ^b^ 0.72 ± 0.46 0.038 ANGPTL4 in cord serum, ng/mL 19.9 ± 15.0 14.1 ± 4.5 13.9 ± 5.2 0.248 ANGPTL4 relative expression in HUVECs 23.1 ± 25.6 ^c^ 21.5 ± 25.8 ^c^ 98.3 ± 104.6 0.001 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: LAR: leptin/adiponectin ratio; LGA: large for gestational age; SGA: small for gestational age.

      "# Abstract The World Health Organization recommends that malaria be confirmed by parasitological diagnosis before treatment using Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT). Despite this, many health workers in malaria endemic countries continue to diagnose malaria based on symptoms alone. This study evaluates interventions to help bridge this gap between guidelines and provider practice. A stratified cluster-randomized trial in 42 communities in Enugu state compared 3 scenarios: Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) with basic instruction (control); RDTs with provider training (provider arm); and RDTs with provider training plus a school-based community intervention (provider-school arm). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients treated according to guidelines, a composite indicator requiring patients to be tested for malaria and given treatment consistent with the test result. The primary outcome was evaluated among 4946 (93%) of the 5311 patients invited to participate. A total of 40 communities (12 in control, 14 per intervention arm) were included in the analysis. There was no evidence of differences between the three arms in terms of our composite indicator (p = 0.36): stratified risk difference was 14% (95% CI -8.3%, 35.8%; p = 0.26) in the provider arm and 1% (95% CI -21.1%, 22.9%; p = 0.19) in the provider-school arm, compared with control. The level of testing was low across all arms (34% in control; 48% provider arm; 37% provider-school arm; p = 0.47). Presumptive treatment of uncomplicated malaria remains an ingrained behaviour that is difficult to change. With or without extensive supporting interventions, levels of testing in this study remained critically low. Governments and researchers must continue to explore alternative ways of encouraging providers to deliver appropriate treatment and avoid the misuse of valuable medicines. ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01350752](#) # Results The trial profile is provided in [Fig 2](#). The study took place between 6^th^ June and 19^th^ December 2011. A total of 42 clusters (14 per arm) were randomised and 40 (12 in control, 14 per intervention arm) were included in the analysis. Two clusters in the control arm were not included in the analysis because no patients visited these health facilities. The primary outcome was evaluated among 4946 (93%) of the 5311 patients invited to participate in the study. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0133832.g002 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Trial profile.</figcaption> </figure> ## Process evaluation Of the 137 facilities that were invited and agreed to participate in the trial, 113 (82%; 125 providers) were represented at the RDT demonstration or provider training. Reasons for non-attendance included being too busy, short-staffed, travelling, bereavement, and sickness or death. The training workshops were successfully delivered, with 112/125 (90%) of participants strongly agreeing that they were satisfied with the delivery of the course by the trainers and the relevance of the material to their work. Participants' knowledge of topics covered in the material increased from 59% to 82% (as measured by the pre-post training test). In the intervention arms 71/79 (90%) facilities received support visits, due to closure of some facilities on the visit days. A total of 109 teachers from 59 schools were initially trained on peer health education and holding community events. Teachers from 57 schools subsequently trained 510 children as PHEs. Twenty-seven schools held a malaria event with considerable variation in terms of the range of activities undertaken, attendance (80 to 400 community members) and duration (1 to 4 hours). The evaluation of pre and post tests for training of school teachers showed an increase in knowledge from 12% to 50%. Three facilities in each of the provider (6%) and control (7%) arm reported stock-outs of RDTs in the 4 weeks prior to the provider survey compared to 1 facility (2%) in the provider-school arm. All facilities procured ACT through the usual channels with a third of facilities in the provider (32%) and provider-school (33%) arms reporting stock-outs in the 4 weeks before the provider survey compared with 16% in control. Stock-outs of ACT mainly occurred in public facilities (86%) compared with pharmacies (5%) and drug stores (23%) due to an unexpected break in supply from the Central Medical Stores to public facilities. ## Characteristics of the study population The stratification and restricted randomisation were shown to have provided study arms that were generally similar in their characteristics with a few exceptions ([Table 1](#)). Patients were more likely to attend pharmacies in the provider-school arm, and drug stores in the other arms. Those in the control arm appear to be of higher socio-economic status and of the highest (tertiary) education. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract The aim of this study was to compare changes in young soccer player's fitness after traditional bilateral vs. unilateral combined plyometric and strength training. Male athletes were randomly divided in two groups; both received the same training, including strength training for knee extensors and flexors, in addition to horizontal plyometric training drills. The only difference between groups was the mode of drills technique: unilateral (UG; *n* = 9; age, 17.3 ± 1.1 years) vs. bilateral (TG; *n* = 9; age, 17.6 ± 0.5 years). One repetition maximum bilateral strength of knee muscle extensors (1RM_KE) and flexors (1RM_KF), change of direction ability (COD), horizontal and vertical jump ability with one (unilateral) and two (bilateral) legs, and limb symmetry index were measured before and after an 8-week in-season intervention period. Some regular soccer drills were replaced by combination of plyometric and strength training drills. Magnitude-based inference statistics were used for between-group and within-group comparisons. Beneficial effects ( *p* < 0.05) in 1RM_KE, COD, and several test of jumping performance were found in both groups in comparison to pre-test values. The limb symmetry index was not affected in either group. The beneficial changes in 1RM_KE (8.1%; *p* = 0.074) and 1RM_KF (6.7%; *p* = 0.004), COD (3.1%; *p* = 0.149), and bilateral jump performance (from 2.7% [ *p* = 0.535] to 10.5% [ *p* = 0.002]) were *possible* to *most likely* beneficial in the TG than in the UG. However, unilateral jump performance measures achieved *likely* to *most likely* beneficial changes in the UG compared to the TG (from 4.5% [ *p* = 0.090] to 8.6% [ *p* = 0.018]). The improvements in jumping ability were specific to the type of jump performed, with greater improvements in unilateral jump performance in the UG and bilateral jump performance in the TG. Therefore, bilateral strength and plyometric training should be complemented with unilateral drills, in order to maximize adaptations. # Results ## Within-group changes Beneficial changes in 1RM_KE (TG: 8 out of 9 individual improvements; UG: 4 out of 9 individual improvements), COD (TG: 9/9; UG: 6/9), CMJ (TG: 8/9; UG: 6/9), CMJd (TG: 5/9; UG: 8/9), CMJnd (TG: 4/9; UG: 7/9), SJnd (TG: 3/9; UG: 6/9), and HC3Jnd (TG: 4/9; UG: 7/9) were found in both groups in comparison to pre-test values. In the TG, beneficial gains were reported 1RM_KF (6 out of 9 improvements), SJ (9/9) and HCMJ (9/9). In the UG SJd (8/9), H3Jd (8/9), H3Jnd (8/9), and HC3Jd (8/9) were likely to very likely improved (Table [2](#) ). The limb symmetry index was not affected in either group. Furthermore, significant differences in each group were reported in Table [2](#) . ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background We aimed to quantify the glycemic effects of quinine in healthy individuals. ## Methods We evaluated the glycemic profile in response to 4 h infusion of 500 ml of 0.9% saline versus 5% glucose solution with and without quinine at therapeutic dose (500 mg) in ten healthy volunteers (8 men) aged 28 ± 9 years. The order of the fourth explorations was randomly assigned. During these explorations, we measured blood glucose every 15 min for 4 h and compared the mean and glycemic fluctuations for each test. A resting ECG was performed before and after quinine infusion in each participant. ## Results The mean glycemic level during the 4-h infusion was 83 ± 5 mg/dl without quinine versus 74 ± 5 ​​mg/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) using saline solute versus 92 ± 7 mg/dl without quinine versus 82 ± 5 mg/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) when associated with the glucose solute. In isotonic dirty solute, quinine induces a cumulative glycemic decrease of 17.5% (p = 0.01) characterized by a nadir estimated at −26.5% at the 60th minute (65 ± 23 mg/dl), p <0.001 followed by a gradual increase until the 4th hour. There were no signs of hypoglycemia or significant prolongation of the QT interval at the ECG. Overall, quinine did not induce a significant change in blood glucose with glucose compared to saline. ## Conclusion The intravenous infusion of quinine at a therapeutic dose induces a light drop in blood glucose with a significant nadir at the 60th minute in the healthy subject without hypoglycemia. This suggests the need for close monitoring in patients at risk of hypoglycemia such as those with severe malaria especially during the first hour of quinine infusion. # Results Quinine infusions were all well tolerated. No subject reported having symptomatic hypoglycemia or significant cardiotoxicity during or after any test day of the study. ## Plasma glucose The mean capillary glycemia during 4 h of infusion were 0.83 ± 0.05, 0.92 ± 0.07, 0.74 ± 0.05 and 0.82 ± 0.05 g/l on normal saline, dextrose 5%, normal saline containing quinine and dextrose 5% containing quinine respectively. On the other hand, the matched mean venous glycemia were 0.97 ± 0.02, 0.99 ± 0.35, 0.97 ± 0.06 and 0.93 ± 0.40 g/l, respectively. On comparing the mean capillary glucose, there was a statistically significant difference between mean glucose levels on isotonic saline and those on isotonic dextrose (p < 0.001). The ratio of the area under curve for saline and saline plus quinine infusions was 89%; thus a decrease in blood sugar of 11% induced by quinine over 4 h. At the 60th min, the maximum glycemic drop was observed; 26.5% for quinine in isotonic saline and 7.6% for quinine in isotonic glucose (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) between mean values during the 4 h of saline infusion versus saline + quinine infusion as shown in Fig. [1](#). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Mean plasma glucose concentrations during a 4 h infusion of 500 ml of saline in healthy volunteers, with a subsequent 4 h infusion of saline with quinine 8 mg/kg body weight</figcaption> </figure> Concerning the 12 lead ECG done before and after the administration of quinine in either isotonic saline or isotonic glucose, lengthening of the QT interval was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

      "# Abstract ## Objectives Administering outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in the community setting (CoPAT) is becoming more common with the increasing emphasis on controlling costs. However, few controlled trials have evaluated this treatment modality. ## Methods Using data from a recent randomized trial comparing daptomycin with standard therapy (semi-synthetic penicillin or vancomycin, each with initial low-dose gentamicin) for *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteraemia and infective endocarditis (SAB/IE), patient characteristics and outcomes were evaluated. Patients receiving their full course of therapy in the hospital setting were compared with those who received some portion outside of the hospital (CoPAT). ## Results Among the 200 patients, 51.5% received CoPAT. These patients were generally younger (median age 50 versus 54 years, *P* = 0.028). In the CoPAT group, there tended to be fewer patients with endocardial involvement (8.7% versus 18.6%, *P* = 0.061) and pre-existing valvular heart disease (7.8% versus 15.5%, *P* = 0.120). CoPAT patients received longer therapy courses (mean 25.4 versus 13.5 days, *P* < 0.001) and had higher rates of therapy completion (90.3% versus 45.4%, *P* < 0.001) and clinical success (86.4% versus 55.7%, *P* < 0.001). Persisting or relapsing *S*. *aureus* was less frequent in the CoPAT group (3.9% versus 15.5%, *P* = 0.007) and there were fewer deaths (3.9% versus 18.6%, *P* = 0.001) 6 weeks after the end of therapy. Hospital readmission occurred for 18 of the 103 (17.5%) CoPAT patients. Clinical success rates were similar for CoPAT patients receiving daptomycin (90.0%) or standard therapy (83.0%). ## Conclusions With proper monitoring, stable patients can complete treatment for SAB/IE as outpatients in the community setting. Daptomycin is an appropriate option for this setting. # Results ## Patient characteristics Two hundred US patients were included in this analysis, with 103 (51.5%) receiving part of their treatment outside of the hospital setting (CoPAT). The majority of CoPAT patients (69/103, 67.0%) were discharged home without assistance and two others (1.9%) went home with assistance. Nineteen of the 103 CoPAT patients (18.4%) were discharged to a skilled nursing facility, while 13/103 (12.6%) were treated in an assisted-living setting, nursing home or rehabilitation centre. The study database did not systematically record the types of venous access devices used to deliver CoPAT. In general, peripherally inserted central catheters were the preferred means of securing venous access. Compared with patients who received all care in the hospital, CoPAT patients were younger (median age 50 versus 54 years, *P* = 0.028) and tended to have fewer cases of endocardial involvement (8.7% versus 18.6%; *P* = 0.061) as well as less pre-existing valvular heart disease (7.8% versus 15.5%, *P* = 0.120). The two groups had a similar distribution of diagnoses (Figure [1](#)) and a similar distribution of study medications.

For IPAT patients, clinical success was observed in 26/50 (52.0%) daptomycin patients and 28/47 (59.6%) comparator patients. Thus, it is justified to combine the treatment groups for analysis of outcomes. CoPAT patients received longer courses of study antibiotics with a mean of 25.4 days (range 9--74 days) compared with 13.5 days (range 1--43) in the IPAT group (*P* < 0.001), and a higher proportion of CoPAT patients completed therapy as part of the study (90.3% versus 45.4%, *P* < 0.001). CoPAT patients received a mean of 14.9 days of therapy outside the hospital setting (Table [1](#)). The shorter duration of study treatment for IPAT patients was influenced by early discontinuations: there were 53 (54.6%) versus 10 (9.7%) in the CoPAT group. The most common reason for discontinuation was adverse events, which accounted for 25/53 (47.2%) IPAT and 8/10 (80.0%) CoPAT patient discontinuations. The adverse events responsible for discontinuation, including rash, infection, renal failure and creatine phosphokinase elevation, are listed in Table [3](#). IPAT patients whose study participation was terminated prior to the end of therapy received subsequent antibiotic therapy as appropriate, but specific information regarding types and duration of additional therapy was not part of the study database. ::::table-wrap\n",

Hospital readmission was required for 18 of the 103 (17.5%) CoPAT patients. As shown in Table [6](#), the reasons for hospital readmission were diverse. Four patients (22.2% of the readmissions and 3.9% of CoPAT patients) were readmitted for reasons related to their initial infection, including osteomyelitis or relapsed SAB. Problems related to provision of treatment in the post-acute care setting led to the readmission of three patients, two of whom relapsed with iv drug use (IVDU) and one of whom developed *Clostridium difficile* colitis. Other medical conditions leading to readmission included pneumonia in three patients and a myriad of other conditions, including unknown reasons, which were each experienced by a single patient. Of the 18 CoPAT patients readmitted to the hospital during the study, half subsequently returned to treatment in the CoPAT setting. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Aphasia affects one third of acute stroke patients. There is a considerable spontaneous recovery in aphasia, but impaired communication ability remains a great problem. Communication difficulties are an impediment to rehabilitation. Early treatment of the language deficits leading to increased communication ability would improve rehabilitation. The aim of this study is to elucidate the efficacy of very early speech and language therapy (SLT) in acute stroke patients with aphasia. ## Methods A prospective, open, randomized, controlled trial was carried out with blinded endpoint evaluation of SLT, starting within 2 days of stroke onset and lasting for 21 days. 123 consecutive patients with acute, first-ever ischemic stroke and aphasia were randomized. The SLT treatment was Language Enrichment Therapy, and the aphasia tests used were the Norsk grunntest for afasi (NGA) and the Amsterdam-Nijmegen everyday language test (ANELT), both performed by speech pathologists, blinded for randomization. ## Results The primary outcome, as measured by ANELT at day 21, was 1.3 in the actively treated patient group and 1.2 among controls. NGA led to similar results in both groups. Patients with a higher level of education (>12 years) improved more on ANELT by day 21 than those with <12 years of education (3.4 vs. 1.0, respectively). In 34 patients in the treatment group and 19 in the control group improvement was ≥1 on ANELT (p < 0.05). There was no difference in the degree of aphasia at baseline except for fluency, which was higher in the group responding to treatment. ## Conclusions Very early intensive SLT with the Language Enrichment Therapy program over 21 days had no effect on the degree of aphasia in unselected acute aphasic stroke patients. In aphasic patients with more fluency, SLT resulted in a significant improvement as compared to controls. A higher educational level of >12 years was beneficial. # Results ## General Results We randomized 123 aphasic patients of which 114 (93%) completed the study and could be tested on day 21 (fig. [1](#)). Follow-up at 6 months could be performed in 99 patients (80%). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the study groups, except for a history of myocardial infarction, which was more frequent in the intervention group (table [1](#)). At the follow-up at 6 months, 5 patients in the intervention group and 6 in the control group had died. Five patients in each group had recurrent stroke. All recurrent strokes occurred beyond the 3 weeks of intervention. ## Primary and Secondary Outcomes The primary outcome in the whole group as measured by ANELT by day 21 was 1.3 among the SLT-treated patients and 1.2 among the controls (table [2](#)). The Diff Coeff was 8.5 in the SLT group and 9 in the control group. Also, per protocol analyses of ANELT by day 21 and for Diff Coeff revealed no statistical difference between the two study groups (table [2](#)). Patients with a higher level of education (>12 years) improved more in ANELT by day 21 than those with <12 years of education [3.4 (1.0--4.8) vs. 1.0 (1.0--2.7); p < 0.01]. Diff Coeff improved more in patients with >12 years of education than in those with <12 years of education [13 (8--26) vs. 8 (1--16); p < 0.01]. Higher values of ANELT, Coeff, fluency, and comprehension at baseline had a positive effect on ANELT by day 21 (p < 0.01), while worse neurological performance as indicated by higher NIHSS values at baseline and longer delay to inclusion had a negative effect on ANELT by day 21 (p < 0.01) and on Diff Coeff (p < 0.05). A multivariate analysis including baseline ANELT, Coeff, fluency, and NIHSS at baseline, as well as age, gender, delay to inclusion, intervention group, and level of education, confirmed that initial ANELT and length of education had an independent, significant impact on the primary outcome (i.e. ANELT by day 21). For secondary outcome (i.e. Diff Coeff), the impact of the initial NIHSS and educational level were significant. The types of aphasia are shown in figure [2](#). There were no differences in aphasia types between the two groups. Only 9 patients had a fluent type of aphasia at baseline, and there were no differences in fluent/non-fluent types of aphasia between the two groups. Best outcome according to ANELT at 3 weeks was seen in transcortical sensory aphasia, followed by isolation, conduction, and Wernicke type of aphasia. Patients with global aphasia had the poorest outcome. ## Follow-Up at 6 Months At 6 months, ANELT and Coeff were similar in the two study groups (table [2](#)). The number of non-study SLT sessions after day 21 was 15 (4--38) in the treatment group and 10 (5--20) in the control group (p = 0.3). ANELT at 6 months of follow-up was 4.5 (1.9--5.0) among those with an education of >12 years and 1.5 (1.0--3.6) among those with less education (p < 0.01). For Coeff at 6 months, the corresponding results were 57 (39--59) and 39 (17--55) (p < 0.01). ## Subgroup Analyses, Responders versus Non-Responders These analyses were performed post hoc. Results in the 53 aphasic stroke patients who improved ≥1 on ANELT (i.e. an improvement which was predetermined to be clinically relevant; responders) are presented in table [3](#). The 34 responders in the SLT treatment group were compared to those 25 patients who improved <1 on ANELT (non-responders). NIHSS at baseline was lower in the responder group than in the non-responder group [5 (2--12) vs. 11 (7--20); p < 0.01]. Aphasia tests showed no difference at baseline except for fluency, which was 37 (30--64) words/min in the responder group and 8 (1.5--30) words/min in the non-responder group (p < 0.001). There were no differences in types of aphasia. The responders improved in all three parts of the NGA (comprehension, naming, and repetition), as compared to the non-responders (all p < 0.01). At 6 months of follow-up, a difference in ANELT remained between responders and non-responders [2.7 (1.2--4.9) vs. 1.1 (0.8--1.6); p < 0.01]. Among those with a fluency of >30 words/min (n = 51), more patients improved >1 on ANELT in the intervention group than among controls (18 vs. 6 patients; p < 0.05). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Microencapsulated sodium butyrate (MSB) has been previously associated with anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties regarding large bowel mucosa. We aimed to examine a role of MSB in patients with diverticulosis, hypothesizing its potential for reduction of diverticulitis episodes and diverticulitis prevention. ## Methods Seventy-three patients with diverticulosis (diagnosed in colonoscopy or/and barium enema or/and CT colography) were recruited for the study and randomized. The investigated group was administered MSB 300 mg daily; the control group was administered placebo. After 12 months, a total of 52 patients completed the study and were subject to analysis (30 subjects and 22 controls). During the study, the number of episodes of diverticulitis (symptomatic diagnosis with acute pain, fever, and leukocytosis), hospitalizations, and surgery performed for diverticulitis were recorded. Additionally, a question regarding subjective improvement of symptoms reflected changes in quality of life during the analysis. ## Results After 12 months, the study group noted a significantly decreased number of diverticulitis episodes in comparison to the control group. The subjective quality of life in the study group was higher than in the control group. There were no side effects of the MSB during the therapy. ## Conclusions MSB reduces the frequency of diverticulitis episodes, is safe, and improves the quality of life. It can play a role in the prevention of diverticulitis. # Results Between 2011 and 2012, 92 patients were enrolled in the study. After exclusion of 19 patients who did not meet the criteria of the study, 73 patients were randomized into the treatment group or placebo group. After 12 months, a total of 52 patients concluded the study and their results were analyzed.

      "# Abstract We examined the effects of a 10--14-weeks inpatient lifestyle modification program, including minimum 90 min of physical activity (PA) five days/week, on body composition, CVD risk factors, and eating behavior in 139 obese subjects (BMI 42.6 ± 5.2 kg/m ^2^ ). Completion rate was 71% ( *n* = 71) in the intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group and 85% ( *n* = 33) among waiting list controls. Compared to controls body weight (−17.0 (95% CI: −18.7, −15.3) kg, *P* < 0.0001), fat mass (−15.2 (95% CI: −17.4, −13.1) kg, *P* < 0.0001), fat free mass (−1.2 (95% CI: −2.2, −0.2) kg, *P* = 0.016) and visceral fat (−86.6(95% CI: −97.4, −75.7) cm ^2^ , *P* < 0.0001) were reduced in the ILI-group after 10--14 weeks. Within the ILI-group weight loss was −23.8 (95% CI: −25.9, −21.7) kg, *P* < 0.0001 and -20.3 (95% CI: −23.3, −17.3) kg, *P* < 0.0001, after six and 12 months, respectively. Systolic BP, glucose, triglycerides, and LDL-C were reduced, and HDL-C was increased (all *P* ≤ 0.006) after 10--14 weeks within the ILI group. The reduction in glucose and increase in HDL-C were sustained after 12 months (all *P* < 0.0001). After one year, weight loss was related to increased cognitive restraint and decreased uncontrolled eating (all *P* < 0.05). Thus, ILI including high volume of PA resulted in weight loss with almost maintenance of fat-free mass, favorable changes in CVD risk factors, and eating behavior in subjects with severe obesity. # 3. Results ## 3.1. Baseline Characteristics Baseline characteristics of the participants who completed the study are shown in [Table 1](#) . The ILI-group was older than the control group, but no other significant differences between the two study groups were seen at baseline. ## 3.2. Between-Group Changes in Body Composition Compared to the control group, reductions in all BC variables were seen in the ILI-group from baseline to weeks 10--14 ( [Table 2](#) and [Figure 3](#) ). ## 3.3. Changes in Weight and Body Composition within the ILI-Group Changes in BC within the ILI-group at weeks 10--14, six, and 12 months are shown in [Table 3](#) . After six- and 12-month followup BW reduction was −23.8 ((95% CI: −25.9, −21.7) kg, *P* < 0.0001) and −20.3 ((95% CI: −23.3, −17.3) kg, *P* < 0.0001), respectively, compared with baseline. Within the ILI-group, the mean (SD) percentage weight loss at 12 months was 15.6% (9.2%), and VFA and FM were reduced by 30.8% (21.1%) and 28.8% (17.4%) compared to baseline, respectively, ( [Figure 3](#) ). The proportions of subjects in the ILI-group achieving ≥5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% reduction of their initial weight, respectively, are shown in [Table 4](#) . [Figure 4](#)shows the development in BMI of each subject in the ILI-group. Fifty-two (73.2%) of the subjects had BMI ≥ 40.0 kg/m ^2^ at week 0, and 51 (71.8%) had BMI < 40.0 kg/m ^2^ at 12-month followup. ## 3.4. Changes in Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors, Metabolic Syndrome, and Exercise Capacity within the ILI-Group At baseline a total of 27 (38.0%), eight (11.3%), and six (8.5%) in the ILI-group were using blood pressure-, lipid- and glucose-lowering medication, respectively. Changes in CVD risk factors and exercise capacity within the ILI-group are shown in Tables [5](#) and [6](#) . The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was reduced significantly ( *P* < 0.0001) within the ILI-group across the four time points ( [Figure 5](#) ). ## 3.5. Eating Behavior before and after Intervention Group comparisons of scores on the TFEQ-R21 showed no differences in eating behavior at baseline ( [Table 7](#) ). Eating behavior in the ILI-group and controls prior to and after treatment is shown in [Figure 6](#) . Together these changes resulted in a significant reduction in UE and EE ( *P* = 0.033 and *P* < 0.0001) and increase in CR ( *P* < 0.0001) scores from week 0 to 12 months of followup within the ILI-group, where the main changes occurred during the intervention period and remained quite stable thereafter. [Table 8](#)shows the univariate GLM analysis with respect to changes in weight and eating behaviour, respectively. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background There is an increasing amount of blood sample rejection at primary health care facilities (PHCFs), impacting negatively the staff, facility, patient and laboratory costs. ## Aim The primary objective was to determine the rejection rate and reasons for blood sample rejection at four PHCFs before and after a phlebotomy training programme. The secondary objective was to determine whether phlebotomy training improved knowledge among primary health care providers (HCPs) and to develop a tool for blood sample acceptability. ## Study setting Two community health centres (CHCs) and two community day centres (CDCs) in Cape Town. ## Methods A quasi-experimental study design (before and after a phlebotomy training programme). ## Results The sample rejection rate was 0.79% (*n* = 60) at CHC A, 1.13% (*n* = 45) at CHC B, 1.64% (*n* = 38) at CDC C and 1.36% (*n* = 8) at CDC D pre-training. The rejection rate remained approximately the same post-training (*p* > 0.05). The same phlebotomy questionnaire was administered pre- and post-training to HCPs. The average score increased from 63% (95% CI 6.97‒17.03) to 96% (95% CI 16.91‒20.09) at CHC A (*p =* 0.039), 58% (95% CI 9.09‒14.91) to 93% (95% CI 17.64‒18.76) at CHC B (*p* = 0.006), 60% (95% CI 8.84‒13.13) to 97% (95% CI 16.14‒19.29) at CDC C (*p =* 0.001) and 63% (95% CI 9.81‒13.33) to 97% (95% CI 18.08‒19.07) at CDC D (*p* = 0.001). ## Conclusion There is no statistically significant improvement in the rejection rate of blood samples (*p* > 0.05) post-training despite knowledge improving in all HCPs (*p* < 0.05). # Results Approximately 6--10 HCPs participated at these different sites. There were 23 study participants ([Table 1](#)) who attended the phlebotomy training session across all the facilities. The age, sex and level of phlebotomy experience of each HCP who attended the training were recorded. There were no exclusion criteria for the above variables of age, sex and level of experience. Most of the HCPs were aged between 30 and 50 years. There was only 1 male participant and 22 females. There were 3 student nurses, 17 nurses and only 3 doctors. The phlebotomy experience across participants varied, with nine participants having less than 5 years' experience, five having 5--10 years' experience and nine having more than 30 years' experience. ::::table-wrap\n",

The total number of blood samples included in the study during May 2014 (pre-training): 7557 from CHC A, 3973 from CHC B, 2321 from CDC C and 589 from CDC D. The total number of blood samples included in the study during July 2014 (post-training): 10 218 from CHC A, 4114 from CHC B, 2279 from CDC C and 630 from CDC D. During the month of May 2014 ([Table 2](#)): 60 of 7557 blood samples (0.79%) were rejected pre-training at CHC A and 79 of 10 218 blood samples (0.77%) post-training (*p* = 0.971). CHC A is the largest of the four facilities. Only 8 of 589 blood samples (1.36%) were rejected pre-training at CDC D and 7 of 630 blood samples (1.11%) post-training (*p* = 0.696).

Technique-related errors include samples that were clotted or haemolysed. Knowledge related errors include errors because of incorrect blood volume or the incorrect blood sample tube used. Request form errors include any error in the completion of the request form such as no patient details indicated, illegible requests, name on sample tube and request form unmatched, no test requested or an unlabelled sample. Unaccountable preanalytical errors include all errors that are not accounted for by the above but that occur in the preanalytical phase of laboratory testing of blood samples. These include samples with missing reasons for rejection, samples older than 3 days, samples that leaked in transit as well as samples that were not received by the laboratory. [Table 3](#) shows a detailed summary of rejection rates and related reasons by facility. At CHC A, many samples were rejected because of clotting, 20 (0.26%) were rejected pre-training and 16 (0.16%) post-training ([Table 3](#)). Request form errors improved post-training from 11 (0.15%) pre-training to 8 (0.08%) post-training. There was an increase in the rejection rate of samples because of unaccountable preanalytical errors, 17 (0.22%) pre-training to 27 (0.26%) post-training ([Figure 1](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>The rejection rate at CHC A.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Concern that mild iodine deficiency in pregnancy may adversely affect neurodevelopment of offspring has led to recommendations for iodine supplementation in the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the effect of iodine supplementation during pregnancy on childhood neurodevelopment. Secondary outcomes included pregnancy outcomes, maternal thyroid function and general health. ## Methods Women with a singleton pregnancy of fewer than 20 weeks were randomly assigned to iodine (150 μg/d) or placebo from trial entry to birth. Childhood neurodevelopment was assessed at 18 months by using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III). Iodine status and thyroid function were assessed at baseline and at 36 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy outcomes were collected from medical records. ## Results The trial was stopped after 59 women were randomly assigned following withdrawal of support by the funding body. There were no differences in childhood neurodevelopmental scores between the iodine treated and placebo groups. The mean cognitive, language and motor scores on the Bayley-III (iodine versus placebo, respectively) were 99.4 ± 12.2 versus 101.7 ± 8.2 (mean difference (MD) −2.3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) −7.8, 3.2; *P* = 0.42), 97.2 ± 12.2 versus 97.9 ± 11.5 (MD −0.7, 95 % CI −7.0, 5.6; *P* = 0.83) and 93.9 ± 10.8 versus 92.4 ± 9.7 (MD 1.4, 95 % CI −4.0, 6.9; *P* = 0.61), respectively. No differences were identified between groups in any secondary outcomes. ## Conclusions Iodine supplementation in pregnancy did not result in better childhood neurodevelopment in this small trial. Adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed to provide conclusive evidence regarding the effect of iodine supplementation in pregnancy. ## Trials registration The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry at [http://www.anzctr.org.au](#). The registration number of this trial is [ACTRN12610000411044](#). The trial was registered on 21 May 2010. # Results Of the 645 women approached, 205 met the eligibility criteria. A total of 59 out of 205 (29 %) women were enrolled in the study from the Women's & Children's Hospital and the Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide, Australia, between June 2010 and October 2010 (Fig. [1](#)). Twenty-nine were randomly allocated to iodine and 30 to placebo (Fig. [1](#)). The baseline demographic characteristics of the participants are listed in Table [1](#). The trial was stopped early, before recruitment began in other Australian centres and New Zealand, because the funding body (NHMRC) withdrew its support for the trial. The NHMRC considered a placebo-controlled trial inconsistent with its recommendation for iodine supplementation in pregnancy. The ethics committees did not withdraw approval for the trial, but in view of the funding body's position it supported the trial management committee's decision to unblind the study and to follow all randomly assigned women as planned to monitor safety. Women were informed of their treatment group allocation and were provided with a copy of the NHMRC recommendation for iodine supplementation in pregnancy [[9](#)]. All women except two (one from each group) consented to continue with the follow-up after unblinding. The mean gestational age at unblinding was 33 ± 7 weeks. The mean duration of intervention before unblinding was 16 weeks (range 2--23 weeks). Nine (31 %) women in the iodine group and 4 (13 %) in the placebo group gave birth before unblinding. The decision regarding whether to continue taking trial supplements or to take commercially available iodine supplements was at the women's discretion. Five women in the iodine group and 18 in the placebo group stopped taking trial supplements. Only one woman in the placebo group commenced iodine supplements after unblinding. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Participant flowchart</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Despite being present in up to 1% of the population, few controlled trials have examined the efficacy of treatments for bipolar II depression. Pooled data are presented from four placebo-controlled studies (BOLDER I [5077US/0049] and II [D1447C00135]; EMBOLDEN I [D1447C00001] and II [D1447C00134]) that evaluated the efficacy of quetiapine monotherapy for depressive episodes in patients with bipolar II disorder. ## Methods All studies included an 8-week, double-blind treatment phase in which patients were randomly assigned to treatment with quetiapine 300 mg/day, quetiapine 600 mg/day, or placebo. Outcome measures included the change from baseline in MADRS total score at week 8, effect sizes, and MADRS response and remission rates. ## Results and discussion Improvements in mean MADRS total scores from baseline to week 8 were significantly greater with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day (−15.58 [*n* = 283] and −14.88 [*n* = 289]; *p* < 0.001) compared with placebo (−11.61 [*n* = 204]). The MADRS effect sizes were 0.44 for quetiapine 300 mg/day and 0.47 for 600 mg/day (*p* < 0.001 vs placebo). Significantly higher proportions of patients receiving quetiapine, at both doses, than placebo-treated patients achieved response and remission at week 8 (*p* < 0.01). Common adverse events associated with quetiapine (both doses) included dry mouth, somnolence, sedation, dizziness, and headache. Rates of mania and hypomania were similar for quetiapine and placebo. Quetiapine monotherapy demonstrated significant efficacy compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated in the treatment of bipolar II depression. # Results Patient disposition is shown in Figure [1](#). A total of 776 (35.2%) patients with bipolar II depression were included in the ITT population (283, 289, and 204 patients received quetiapine 300 mg/day, quetiapine 600 mg/day, or placebo, respectively). The safety population comprised 819 patients with bipolar II depression (298, 307, and 214 patients received quetiapine 300 mg/day, quetiapine 600 mg/day, or placebo, respectively), representing 35.4% of the total pooled safety population of patients with bipolar I or II depression from the four studies (*N* = 2,314). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Patient disposition.</strong></figcaption> </figure> At baseline, the demographic and clinical characteristics were similar among treatment groups (Table [1](#)).

Significant separation from placebo was observed from week 1 for both doses of quetiapine and was maintained through week 8 (Figure [2](#)). Effect sizes, based on MADRS scores, were moderate for both quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day (MMRM: 0.44 and 0.47, respectively, *p* < 0.001 vs placebo; Figure [3](#)). The effect sizes in the bipolar I population in the four trials were 0.58 for quetiapine 300 mg/day and 0.64 for quetiapine 600 mg/day (Figure [3](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Mean change from baseline to week 8 in MADRS total score (ITT population; LOCF).</strong></figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Effect sizes of quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day in patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.</strong></figcaption> </figure> Patients with bipolar II disorder stratified by a rapid- (≥4 mood episodes per year) or nonrapid-cycling course also demonstrated significant improvements in MADRS total score at week 8. Among patients without a rapid-cycling course, MADRS total score improved significantly by a mean (SE) of 15.18 (0.67) and 14.25 (0.66) with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day compared with 11.58 (0.75) points for placebo (*p* < 0.001 and *p* = 0.005 for quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day, respectively) at week 8. Significant symptomatic improvements at week 8 were also observed in patients with rapid cycling: 16.80 (1.63) and 16.92 (1.71) for quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day versus 11.12 (1.95) for placebo (*p* = 0.011 and *p* = 0.012, respectively). In the exploratory analysis of the relationship between MADRS total score at baseline and end of treatment, there was an indication that the difference between placebo and both quetiapine doses at end of treatment increased as baseline score increased (Table [2](#); Figure [4](#)). However, given the *post hoc* and exploratory nature of this analysis where the studies were not designed for this purpose, no formal inference can be made. ::::table-wrap\n",

Among quetiapine-treated patients, 64.7% (300 mg/day) and 62.6% (600 mg/day) were classified as responders at week 8 compared with 49.0% of placebo-treated patients (*p* < 0.001 and *p* < 0.01 for 300 and 600 mg/day, respectively; ITT, LOCF). When compared with placebo (46.1%), significantly more quetiapine-treated patients met remission criteria at week 8 (65.0% and 61.9%, respectively; *p* < 0.001 vs placebo; ITT, LOCF). At week 8, NNT for response and remission were 6 and 5 for quetiapine 300 mg/day and 7 and 6 for quetiapine 600 mg/day, respectively. ### Hamilton rating scale for depression total score Patients who were treated with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day demonstrated significantly greater improvements in HAM-D total score from week 1 through week 8 compared with placebo (*p* < 0.001; ITT, LOCF). At week 8, HAM-D total scores improved by a mean (SE) of 14.00 (0.49) and 13.57 (0.49) points for quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day, respectively, versus 10.88 (0.55) for placebo (*p* < 0.001). ### Hamilton rating scale for anxiety total score Following quetiapine treatment, patients demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety, as measured by mean change from baseline in HAM-A total score at week 8 (*p* < 0.05 both doses vs placebo; Figure [6](#)). Significant improvements in HAM-A total score with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day versus placebo were observed from week 1 onward (−9.62 [*p* < 0.001] and −8.89 [*p* < 0.05] vs −7.34 at week 8, respectively; ITT, LOCF). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Mean change from baseline to week 8 in HAM-A total score (ITT population; LOCF).</strong></figcaption> </figure> ### Safety Overall rates of adverse events in the pooled safety population were 73.8%, 74.3%, and 67.8% for the quetiapine 300 mg/day, 600 mg/day, and placebo arms, respectively. As shown in Table [3](#), common adverse events associated with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day included dry mouth, somnolence, sedation, and dizziness. Adverse events potentially related to extrapyramidal symptoms were observed in 12.4%, 8.8%, and 6.1% of the quetiapine 300 mg/day, quetiapine 600 mg/day, and placebo groups, respectively. Rates of treatment-emergent mania/hypomania during acute treatment were similar among the treatment groups: 1.3%, 3.3%, and 2.3% for quetiapine 300 mg/day, 600 mg/day, and placebo arms, respectively. Rates of discontinuation because of adverse events were 12.1% for quetiapine 300 mg/day, 17.9% for quetiapine 600 mg/day, and 5.1% for placebo. Changes from baseline in weight and laboratory parameters during acute treatment are presented in Table [4](#). Although average weight gain was only about 1 kg greater in the two groups receiving quetiapine, the proportions of patients in both arms gaining at least 7% body weight was higher in both quetiapine arms (Table [4](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## OBJECTIVES: Conflicting results were reported about the effectiveness of Low level laser therapy on musculoskeletal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of 850‐nm gallium arsenide aluminum (Ga‐As‐Al) laser therapy on pain, range of motion and disability in subacromial impingement syndrome. ## METHODS: A total of 52 patients (33 females and 19 males with a mean age of 53.59±11.34 years) with subacromial impingement syndrome were included. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups. Group I (n = 30, laser group) received laser therapy (5 joule/cm^2^ at each point over maximum 5‐6 painful points for 1 minute). Group II (n = 22, placebo laser group) received placebo laser therapy. Initially cold pack (10 minutes) was applied to all of the patients. Also patients were given an exercise program including range of motion, stretching and progressive resistive exercises. The therapy program was applied 5 times a week for 14 sessions. Pain severity was assessed by using visual analogue scale. Range of motion was measured by goniometer. Disability was evaluated by using Shoulder Pain and Disability Index. ## RESULTS: In group I, statistically significant improvements in pain severity, range of motion except internal and external rotation and SPADI scores were observed compared to baseline scores after the therapy (p<0.05). In Group II, all parameters except range of motion of external rotation were improved (p<0.05). However, no significant differences were recorded between the groups (p>0.05). ## CONCLUSIONS: The Low level laser therapy seems to have no superiority over placebo laser therapy in reducing pain severity, range of motion and functional disability. # RESULTS Fifty two patients (33 females, 19 males) with a mean age of 53.59±11.34 years with SAIS were included in the study. All patients were able to complete the therapy program without any adverse effects. The results of complete blood count, biochemical markers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C‐reactive protein of the patients were found to be normal. The sociodemographic and clinic characteristics of the patients were given in [Table 1](#). No statistically significant differences were detected between the groups in initial values (p>0.05). In group I, after the therapy statistically significant improvements in pain severity, ROM except internal and external rotation and SPADI scores were observed compared to baseline scores (p<0.05). In Group II, all parameters except ROM of external rotation were improved (p<0.05). However, no significant differences were recorded between the groups (p>0.05) ([Table 2](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Etoricoxib is a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor which was evaluated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ## Methods Double-blind, randomized, placebo and active comparator-controlled, 12-week study conducted at 67 sites in 28 countries. Eligible patients were chronic NSAID users who demonstrated a clinical worsening of arthritis upon withdrawal of prestudy NSAIDs. Patients received either placebo, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily, or naproxen 500 mg twice daily (2:2:1 allocation ratio). Primary efficacy measures included direct assessment of arthritis by counts of tender and swollen joints, and patient and investigator global assessments of disease activity. Key secondary measures included the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, patient global assessment of pain, and the percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response (a composite of pain, inflammation, function, and global assessments). Tolerability was assessed by adverse events and routine laboratory evaluations. ## Results 1171 patients were screened, 891 patients were randomized (N = 357 for placebo, N = 353 for etoricoxib, and N = 181 for naproxen), and 687 completed 12 weeks of treatment (N = 242 for placebo, N = 294 for etoricoxib, and N = 151 for naproxen). Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving etoricoxib and naproxen showed significant improvements in all efficacy endpoints (p<0.05). Treatment responses were similar between the etoricoxib and naproxen groups for all endpoints. The percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response was 41% in the placebo group, 59% in the etoricoxib group, and 58% in the naproxen group. Etoricoxib and naproxen were both generally well tolerated. ## Conclusions In this study, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily was more effective than placebo and similar in efficacy to naproxen 500 mg twice daily for treating patients with RA over 12 weeks. Etoricoxib 90 mg was generally well tolerated in RA patients. # Results ## Patients Of the 1171 patients screened, 891 met eligibility criteria and were randomized. Baseline characteristics of the 891 patients in the 3 treatment groups were similar and are shown in Table [1](#). A total of 687 of the 891 patients (67.8% of the placebo group, 83.3% of the etoricoxib group, and 83.4% of the naproxen group) completed the 12-week study (Figure [1](#)). The mean number of days patients were on treatment was 65.5 for placebo, 76.0 for etoricoxib, and 76.5 for naproxen. The most common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy, and significantly more patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy in the placebo group than in the etoricoxib and naproxen group (25.2%, 12.5%, 10.5%, respectively, p<0.001 vs placebo). The results of all patients who had at least one post-randomization efficacy measurement were included in the primary analysis of efficacy (93.0% in the placebo group, 97.5% in the etoricoxib group and 96.1% in the naproxen group). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Study flowchart.

For all 4 primary endpoints, etoricoxib and naproxen were statistically superior to placebo. For all secondary endpoints, except serum C-reactive protein, both etoricoxib and naproxen were also superior to placebo. Serum C-reactive protein levels increased on etoricoxib compared to placebo. This was not seen in the naproxen group. There was no significant difference between etoricoxib and naproxen for any of the primary or secondary endpoints. The percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response was 40.9% in the placebo group, 58.7% in the etoricoxib group, and 57.5% in the naproxen group. Treatment effects of etoricoxib were rapid, occurring at the earliest time point measured (week 2), and were maintained over the entire 12-week study period (Figures [2a,2b,2c,2d](#)). Treatment effects of etoricoxib were consistent across corticosteroid users and non-users. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Changes from baseline on primary endpoints: a) tender joint counts; b) swollen joint counts; c) patient global assessments of disease activity; d) investigator global assessments of disease activity.

There was no individual drug-related adverse event that was predominantly responsible for the difference between etoricoxib and placebo; in fact, there were no individual drug-related adverse events with an incidence ≥4% in any treatment group. The active treatments were not significantly different from placebo (p>0.05) with regard to the percentages of patients with any serious clinical adverse event or who discontinued due to a clinical adverse event (Table [3](#)). Only 3 of the serious clinical adverse events were judged to be drug-related by the investigators: 2 on etoricoxib (duodenal ulcer and hip pain) and 1 on naproxen (hypertension). There were no deaths reported. No clinically relevant trends were noted in the overall incidence of laboratory adverse events or mean changes in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin plus hematocrit. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objectives: To compare the combination of paracetamol (20 mg/kg) and propofol to fentanyl (1 µg/kg) and propofol in terms of providing adequate analgesia and a comparable recovery profile in suction termination procedures. ## Methods: This is a prospective, randomized clinical study in which we obtained informed consents from 146 women (fentanyl group: 76 [52.1%], paracetamol group: 70 [47.9%]) who were scheduled for suction curettage at the Istanbul Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Education and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey in January 2015. Patients were randomly allocated into a fentanyl group or a paracetamol group. Visual analogue scores, modified Aldrete scores, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded during and after the surgical procedure. A record was also maintained of any adverse events. ## Results: When the modified Aldrete scores at 60 minutes, systolic pressures at 0 minutes, oxygen saturation at 10, 15, 20 minutes, diastolic blood pressure at 10, 15, 20 minutes, heart rates, and visual analogue scores were compared, there was no significant difference between groups (p>0.05). In the fentanyl group, systolic blood pressures at 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes and diastolic blood pressure at 5 minutes and oxygen saturation at 5 minutes were significantly lower (p<0.05). ## Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that the analgesic properties and recovery profiles of intravenous paracetamol is as effective as fentanyl when used in suction termination procedures. Further larger studies are still required. # Results There were 146 patients involved in this study. When the demographic data, ASA and operation values of the 146 patients were compared (**[Figure 1](#)**), no significant differences were determined between groups (*p*>0.05) (**[Table 1](#)**). Also, no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of VAS and modified Aldrete scores after 60 minutes (*p*>0.05) (**[Table 2](#)**). There was no significant difference in the HR between groups (*p*>0.05) (**[Figure 2](#)**). In the fentanyl group, systolic blood pressures at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes were significantly lower (*p*<0.05) than in the paracetamol group; however, there was no difference between groups at 0 minutes (*p*>0.05) (**[Figure 3](#)**). Diastolic blood pressures at 5 minutes were significantly lower (*p*<0.05) in the fentanyl group; however, there were no differences between groups at 10, 15 and 20 minutes (*p*>0.05) (**[Figure 4](#)**). In the fentanyl group, SpO~2~ at 5 minutes was significantly lower (*p*<0.05) than in the paracetamol group, but there were no differences between groups at 10, 15, and 20 minutes (*p*>0.05) (**[Figure 5](#)**). No significant differences were found between groups with respect to side effects. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow diagram of 146 women who were scheduled for suction curettage.

      "# Abstract # Abstract ## Background and aims: Recent studies have shown that etomidate is associated with fewer serious adverse events than propofol and has a noninferior sedative effect. We investigated whether etomidate--midazolam is associated with fewer cardiopulmonary adverse events and has noninferior efficacy compared to propofol--midazolam for screening colonoscopy in the elderly. ## Methods: A prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was performed. Patients aged over 65 years who were scheduled to undergo screening colonoscopy were randomized to receive either etomidate or propofol based on midazolam. The primary outcome was all cardiopulmonary adverse events. The secondary outcomes were vital sign fluctuation (VSF), adverse events disturbing the procedure, and sedation-related outcomes. ## Results: The incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events was higher in the propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate group (54.8%) ( *P = *.040). VSF was detected in 17 (27.4%) and 31 (50.0%) patients in the etomidate and propofol groups, respectively ( *P = *.010). The incidence rate of adverse events disturbing the procedure was significantly higher in the etomidate group (25.8%) than in the propofol group (8.1%) (*P = *.008). Moreover, the incidence rate of myoclonus was significantly higher in the etomidate group (16.1%) than in the propofol group (1.6%) ( *P = *.004). There was no statistical significance between the 2 groups with respect to sedation times and sedation-related outcomes including patients' and endoscopist's satisfaction. In the multivariate analysis, the etomidate group had significantly low odds ratio (OR) associated with VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval: 0.179--0.926, *P = *.032). ## Conclusions: We recommend using etomidate--midazolam in patients with high ASA score or vulnerable to risk factors; propofol--midazolam may be used as a guideline in patients with low ASA score. # Results ## Demographic and baseline characteristics Initially, 130 patients aged over 65 years were assessed. Among them, six patients were excluded because of adrenocortical insufficiency (n = 1), desire to undergo endoscopy without sedation (n = 3), hypersensitivity to the drug (n = 1), or previous history of adverse events with sedation (n = 1) (Fig. [1](#)). Finally, a total of 124 patients aged over 65 years were enrolled, analyzed, and randomly assigned to 2 groups: propofol group (n = 62) and etomidate group (n = 62). The baseline characteristics including age, sex, procedure type, body mass index, smoking and alcohol history, outpatient status, anticoagulant use, ASA score, modified Mallampati score, and underlying diseases were not significantly different in the 2 groups (Table [1](#)). Additionally, there was no difference in interventional procedures such as polypectomy (*P* = .773), biopsy ( *P* = .930), and epinephrine injection ( *P = *.934). Sedation-related outcomes such as induction time ( *P = *.833), total procedure time ( *P = *.111) and awake time (*P = *.070) were not different (Table [2](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Assembly of patients.

      "# Abstract ## Objectives. The purpose is to investigate effect of septoplasty and widened nasal patency on voice quality. ## Methods. Fifty patients who undergone septoplasty were included in the study. Thirty-three people who had similar age and distribution were enrolled as control group. Before and 1 and 3 months after surgery, anterior rhinomanometry, voice analysis by Multi-Dimensional Voice Program, and spectrographic analysis were performed to patients. The recordings of /a/ vowel were used to evaluate average fundamental frequency (F0), jitter percent, and shimmer percent. In spectrographic analyses, F3--F4 values for the vowels /i, e, a, o, and u/, nasal formant frequencies of the consonants /m/ and /n/ in the word /mini/, and 4 formant frequencies (F1, F2, F3, and F4) for nasalized /i/ vowel following a nasal consonant /n/ in the word /mini/ were compared. The differences in nasal resonance were evaluated. All patients were asked whether change in their voices after the surgery. Preoperative and postoperative voice parameters and anterior rhinomanometry results were compared separately with the control group as well as in the patient group itself. ## Results. Preoperative total nasal resistance (TNR) values of patients were higher than the control group (*P*=0.001). TNR values of patients measured one day before surgery and after surgery in the 1st and 3rd months were different and these differences were significant statistically (*P*=0.001). There was no significant difference between the voice analysis parameters in preoperative, postoperative 1st, and 3rd months. As a result of their subjective reviews, 12 patients (36%) noted their voices were better than before surgery and 20 patients (61%) noted no change before and after surgery. ## Conclusion. Providing widened nasal cavity has no effect on voice quality. # RESULTS There were 29 men and 21 women in the study group. None of them was applied sinus surgery. Seven patients who did not come to their postoperative controls, 3 patients who were observed septal perforation after septoplasty and could not be done ARM due to perforation, and 7 patients who had higher TNR value than avarage TNR value of control group were excluded. There were 9 patients applied radiofrequency ablation and all of them was in excluded group. Except absent patients, successful septoplasty rate was 77%. The study was conducted with 33 patients who have an increased nasal patency. Nineteen men (58%) and 14 women (42%) were enrolled as patient group and the mean age of patients was 25 years (range, 18 to 53 years). The mean age of control group was 27 years (range, 18 to 51 years) and there was no significant difference in terms of age and sex between patients and the control group (*P*<0.05) ([Table 1](#)). Preoperative mean TNR value of patients was higher than the control group's and this difference was significant statistically (*P*=0.001). Preoperative TNR values of patients decreased post-operatively and these differences were again significant statistically (*P*=0.001) ([Table 2](#)). When asked patients whether changes in their voices after surgery, 20 patients (61%) noted no change, 12 patients (36%) said there was a change in a good way, and one (3%) noted a change in a bad way. Compared analysis results of /a/ vowel, there was no significant difference between the values before and 1 and 3 months after surgery ([Table 3](#)). Compared these results with the control group, there was no significant difference except NHR value (*P*=0.017). This difference was not reviewed, because it was not related to change of TNR. Compared analysis results of /n/ nasal consonant; there was no significant difference between the values before and 1 and 3 months after surgery. Compared these results with the control group, there were significant differences statistically about F3 formant freqency in postoperative 1st and 3rd months (*P*=0.022, *P*=0.024) and F4 formant frequency in postoperative 1st month (*P*=0.017) ([Table 4](#)). These differences were not significant clinically because these frequencies had not significant change in patient group. Compared analysis results of /mini/ word, there was no significant difference postoperative and with the control group ([Table 5](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in infancy with a complex pathology. In adults, the clinical severity of AD has been associated with increases in T helper cell type (Th) 2, Th22, and Th17 serum markers, including high levels of CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 17 and CCL22 chemokines. ## Objective To explore the possible association between serum chemokine levels and AD severity in infants with moderate-to-severe AD and elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE). ## Subjects and methods Serum samples ( *n* = 41) obtained from a randomized, double-blind, and clinical dietary intervention study were used to study biomarkers in infants with AD. Baseline- and post-intervention samples (4 months) were used, six chemokines and nine ratios thereof were analyzed using Luminex and correlated to AD severity. In the initial study, the infants were randomized to receive extensively hydrolyzed whey-based formula without (control) or with short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides/long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (9:1) and *Bifidobacterium breve* M-16V (active). ## Results 31 Infants up to 11 months of age, with an objective-SCORAD score (oSCORAD) ≥ 20 and elevated total-IgE and/or specific-IgE levels were included. In time, the median oSCORAD decreased in both groups by −8 (control, *p*  < 0.05; active, *p*  < 0.01). Irrespective of dietary intervention, several changes in Th2 chemokines (CCL17 and CCL22), inflammatory chemokine (CCL20), and the Th1 chemokine, CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 9, were detected over time. Overall CCL17 correlated to oSCORAD ( *r* = 0.446, *p*  < 0.01). After 4 months of dietary intervention, CXCL9 was higher ( *p*  < 0.01) in the active group compared with control [active, 2.33 (1.99--2.89); controls, 1.95 (1.77--2.43) log 10 median (range)]. In addition, a reduction in Th2/Th1 chemokine ratios for CCL17/CXCL9, CCL22/CXCL9, CCL20/CXCL10, and CCL20/CXCL11 was detected associated with the active intervention. ## Conclusion While this study is small and exploratory in nature, these data contribute to immune biomarker profiling and understanding of AD in infants. # Results ## Infant Characteristics Overall, 53 infants with moderate-to-severe AD were screened. Of these, 31 infants had elevated IgE levels and were therefore considered eligible for randomization. In total, 26 infants completed the study (Figure [1](#) ).

Complementary feeding was first introduced at a median (Q1--Q3) of 5 (4--6) months among all infants. ## Effect on Severity of AD At baseline, oSCORAD between the study groups was comparable, with a median (Q1--Q3) oSCORAD in the control group of 24 (21--27) and 21 (20--26) in the active group. After 4 months of dietary intervention, the average oSCORAD decreased in those infants ( *n* = 26) who completed the study. The median change in both groups of −8, resulted in a median (Q1--Q3) post-intervention oSCORAD of 17 (12--21) in the control group and 13 (12--17) in the active group. Interestingly, only four out of thirteen (31%) infants in the active group retained an oSCORAD above 15 (moderate AD) compared with eight out of thirteen (62%) infants in the control group. AD exacerbations occurred in 8 out of 26 infants (4 in both groups 30.8%) during dietary intervention period. The use of topical steroids during the dietary intervention period appears similar in both groups ( *p*  > 0.05) with a median (Q1--Q3) topical steroid use of 118.5 (113.5--120.8) days in the control group and 117.0 (113.0--121.5) days in the active group. ## Exploratory Immune Profiles in AD In total, 41 serum samples obtained from the clinical study were used for exploring the biomarker profiles of infants with moderate to severe AD and elevated IgE levels. For these infants from which serum samples were obtained, reduction of oSCORAD at baseline and after 4 months of dietary intervention is shown in (Figure [2](#) ). Non-parametric analyses were performed and indicated within the figures. Small sample sizes are in general a good argument to use non-parametric statistics, as possible skewness in the data may not be revealed. Additional parametric analysis using ordinary one-way ANOVA was performed, to show robustness of the data. The analysis indicated no differences between the groups at baseline and confirmed the significant decline within control ( *p*  < 0.001) as well as within active ( *p*  < 0.0001) of oSCORAD, which support the non-parametric analysis. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Reduction of atopic dermatitis severity over time.

Both levels, however, did not significantly change in either group (Figures [3](#) A,B). The levels of Th2 driving chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 significantly changed over time (Figures [3](#) C,D). In the control group, a significant reduction of CCL22, but not CCL17, was detected (W-test, *p*  < 0.05), whereas in the active group, both CCL17 and CCL22 were significantly reduced (W-test, *p*  < 0.05, for both). CCL20, a strong chemokine for DCs, remained unchanged in the control group, yet was significantly reduced in the active group after 4 months of dietary intervention (W-test, *p*  < 0.05) (Figure [3](#) E). While no differences were observed in the release of Th1-driving chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in the control group, after 4 months of dietary intervention, CXCL9 levels were significantly higher in the active group as compared with the control group (MWU, *p*  < 0.01). The dietary intervention resulted in a higher CXCL9 level (log 10 median, 2.33; range 1.99--2.89) in the active group as compared with the control group (1.95; 1.77--2.43) (Figures [3](#) F--H).

      "# Abstract ## Background: Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been used to provide intra- and post-operative analgesia with single incision laparoscopic (SIL) bariatric and gynecological surgery with mixed results. Its efficacy in providing analgesia for SIL cholecystectomy (SILC) via the same approach remains unexplored. ## Aims: The primary objective of our study was to compare the efficacy of bilateral TAP block with local anesthetic infiltration for perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing SILC. ## Settings and Design: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial performed in a tertiary care hospital. ## Materials and Methods: Forty-two patients undergoing SILC were randomized to receive either ultrasound-guided (USG) bilateral mid-axillary TAP blocks with 0.375% ropivacaine or local anesthetic infiltration of the port site. The primary outcome measure was the requirement of morphine in the first 24 h postoperatively. ## Statistical Analysis: The data were analyzed using *t*-test, Mann--Whitney test or Chi-square test. ## Results: The 24 h morphine requirement (mean ± standard deviation) was 34.57 ± 14.64 mg in TAP group and 32.76 ± 14.34 mg in local infiltration group (*P* = 0.688). The number of patients requiring intraoperative supplemental fentanyl in TAP group was 8 and in local infiltration group was 16 (*P* = 0.028). The visual analog scale scores at rest and on coughing were significantly higher in the local infiltration group in the immediate postoperative period (*P* = 0.034 and *P* = 0.007, respectively). ## Conclusion: USG bilateral TAP blocks were not effective in decreasing 24 h morphine requirement as compared to local anesthetic infiltration in patients undergoing SILC although it provided some analgesic benefit intraoperatively and in the initial 4 h postoperatively. Hence, the benefits of TAP blocks are not worth the effort and time spent for administering them for this surgery. # RESULTS Flow of patients is given in [Figure 2](#). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow of patients in the study</figcaption> </figure> The demographic parameters were similar among the two study groups [[Table 1](#)]. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "![]():::: The number of patients requiring intraoperative supplemental fentanyl in the TAP group was 8 and in the control group was 16 (*P* = 0.028*). The supplemental dosing of fentanyl (median [minimum--maximum]) in the TAP group was 0 µg (0--120) and in the control group was 30 µg (0--120) (*P* = 0.013*). The total 24 h morphine requirement (mean ± SD) was 34.57 ± 14.64 mg in TAP group and 32.76 ± 14.34 mg in control group (*P* = 0.688). The time to first analgesic demand via the PCA device was similar in both groups (35 min [10--130] in TAP group vs. 40 min [15--230] in control group [median (minimum--maximum)]; *P* = 0.369). Postoperative VAS scores were significantly more in control group at shifting [[Table 2](#)]. At 4 h, none of the patients in the TAP group but seven patients (33.3%) in the control group had moderate to severe pain (VAS >3) at rest (*P* = 0.009*).

      "# Abstract ## Objective The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of an ultra-low-dose vaginal estriol 0.03 mg in combination with viable *Lactobacillus acidophilus* KS400 (Gynoflor^®^ vaginal tablets) in the short-term therapy and to investigate the long-term maintenance dose in the treatment of vaginal atrophy. ## Methods This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (Controlled phase *--* initial therapy) followed by an open-label follow-up (Open phase -- test medication initial and maintenance therapy). Included were postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy symptoms and Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) of ≤ 40%. The method of treatment was initial therapy with test medication (or placebo in first phase), one vaginal tablet daily for 12 days, followed by maintenance therapy, one tablet on two consecutive days weekly for 12 weeks. ## Results A total of 87 women completed the study. The Controlled phase results for a change in VMI demonstrated superiority of the 0.03 mg estriol--lactobacilli combination to placebo (*p* < 0.001). In the test group, the positive change in VMI was 35.2%, compared to 9.9% in the placebo group. In the Open phase after the initial therapy, the VMI was increased to 55.4% and, during maintenance therapy, it stayed at a comparable level (52.8--49.4%). The maturation of epithelium was followed by improvement of clinical symptoms and normalization of the vaginal ecosystem. ## Conclusions The ultra-low-dose, vaginal 0.03 mg estriol--lactobacilli combination (Gynoflor^®^) was superior to placebo with respect to changes in VMI after the 12-day initial therapy, and the maintenance therapy of two tablets weekly was sufficient to prevent the relapse of vaginal atrophy. # Results An overview of subject disposition is given in [Figure 2](#). A total of 87 women completed both phases of the study as scheduled. Reasons for discontinuation were premature discontinuation at their own request or failure to show up at control visits. One woman in the placebo group withdrew her consent before visit C1 and was excluded from the ITT population due to no data. Another woman in the placebo group was excluded from the PPS population due to prior termination of the study after visit C1. During the Open phase, there was another major protocol violation as the woman did not comply with the treatment. All randomized subjects were part of the SAF population. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Disposition of subjects, Controlled phase.

The percentage of women with moderate or severe dryness decreased more in the estriol--lactobacilli combination group, resulting in a significant difference between the groups, both at C1 (*p* = 0.023) and at C2 (*p* < 0.001). The number of women who reported having intercourse was too low for a valid statistical analysis of dyspareunia (E: approximately 45%, C1 and C2: 11--21%). The percentage with moderate or severe dyspareunia at E was 84% in the estriol--lactobacilli combination group and 90% in the placebo group. The corresponding numbers at C1 were 40% for both groups, and at C2 -0% in the estriol--lactobacilli combination group and 22% in the placebo group.

The percentages of the increase of superficial cells and the decrease of parabasal cells showed a similar dynamic: at C1 there were no significant differences between the groups; however, at C2 significant improvements in favor of the estriol--lactobacilli combination were observed. The number of lactobacilli and LBG also improved in both groups at C1, with no significant difference between the groups. But again, the corresponding results at C2 were significantly better in the test medication group. The mean vaginal pH decreased significantly more in the estriol--lactobacilli combination group as compared to placebo both at C1 and at C2. The global efficacy of the estriol--lactobacilli combination by investigator was significantly better than that of placebo, both at C1 and at C2.

The majority of the investigators and the women judged the global tolerability of test medication as very good or good. ## Open phase For the Open phase, all women (*n* = 87) in the two groups in the Controlled phase were combined (see Methods), and results were analyzed at Follow-up 1 (after daily initial therapy), Follow-up 2 and Follow-up 3 (weekly maintenance therapy). After the daily initial therapy with the estriol--lactobacilli combination, VMI was clearly increased ([Figure 5](#)). During the weekly maintenance therapy, the mean VMI stayed at a comparable level at Follow-up visits 2 and 3, showing moderate estrogenic stimulation. Thus, the 0.03 mg estriol--lactobacilli combination at a regimen of two vaginal tablets per week was on average sufficient to maintain the improved VMI after the initial 12-day therapy. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Dynamics of Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI), Open phase.

In women having intercourse, dyspareunia after initial therapy clearly decreased from 64.2% to 21.4% at Follow-up 1, to 14.3% at Follow-up 2, and further to 3.2% at Follow-up 3. All other secondary variables are shown in [Table 4](#). The total symptom score improved strongly during initial therapy and further improved slightly during maintenance therapy. The percentage of epithelial cells clearly improved during initial therapy and remained at similar levels at Follow-up visits 2 and 3. The percentage of women with more than 50 lactobacilli per field of view clearly increased not only during initial therapy, but also during maintenance therapy, reaching the highest level at the end of the study. A similar development was observed for LBG: the percentage of women with a normal flora (LBG I) increased also during the maintenance therapy, resulting in 67% of all women having a normal flora and only 6% having an abnormal flora at the end of the study. The global assessments of efficacy (good or very good) by investigator and patient were 89% and 92%, respectively, and highest at the end of the Open phase. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Context: Resveratrol has been used for the treatment of endometriosis. ## Objective: To compare resveratrol (40 mg/d) with monophasic contraceptive pill (COC) to COC with placebo for the reduction of pain scores. ## Design: A randomized clinical trial. ## Setting: University Hospital. ## Patients: Women (ages 20 to 50) with laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis were eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria: pregnancy, allergy to resveratrol, or contraindications to COC, use of agonists of gonadotropin release hormone or danazol in the last month, or had used depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or Mirena®. ## Intervention: Subjects were randomized using a computer-generated randomization list to receive COC for 42 days to be taken with identical capsules containing 40 mg of resveratrol or placebo in coded bottles (1:1 ratio). Allocation was concealed in coded, sequenced, opaque-sealed envelopes. ## Main Outcome: Median pain scores measured with a visual analog scale on day 42. ## Results: Between 18 June and 6 November 2015, 44 subjects were enrolled. Mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] pain scores on day 0 were 5.4 (4.2 to 6.6) in the placebo group and 5.7 (4.8 to 6.6) in resveratrol groups. After treatment, pain values were [3.9 (2.2 to 5); n = 22] and [3.2 (2.1 to 4.3); n = 22] in the placebo and resveratrol groups, respectively ( *P* = 0.7; Mann-Whitney *U* test). Median (95% CI) difference between groups was 0.75 (--1.6 to 2.3). ## Conclusion: Resveratrol is not superior to placebo for treatment of pain in endometriosis. Resveratrol, a natural phytoestrogen, has been suggested as a possible treatment option for women with endometriosis. This study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. # 2. Results ## A. Participants Two hundred and forty-three women with diagnosis of endometriosis were screened for acceptance into the study between 18 June and 6 November 2015. Of these, 199 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Forty-four subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment regimens. Forty-three women received treatment as allocated. Five women were removed from the PP analysis. One discontinued the study after signing the informed consent, one was removed from the study for intense abnormal uterine bleeding that stopped after medical intervention, and three were lost to follow-up ( [Fig. 1](#) ). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow diagram of study population randomized to two treatment groups.</figcaption> </figure> For each group, 22 subjects were analyzed as ITT. Outcomes PP were analyzed in 21 and 18 subjects in the resveratrol and placebo arms, respectively. Baseline data of the studied population are depicted in [Table 1](#) . ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Little information is available about whether the use of self-assessment instruments in primary care affects depression course and outcome. The purpose was to evaluate whether using a depression self-rating scale in recurrent person-centred GP consultations affected depression severity, quality of life, medication use, and sick leave frequency. ## Methods Patients in the intervention group met their GP regularly at least 4 times during the 3 months intervention. In addition to treatment as usual (TAU), patients completed a self-assessment instrument (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) on each occasion, and then GPs used the completed instrument as the basis for a person-centred discussion of changes in depression symptoms. The control group received TAU. Frequency of visits in the TAU arm was the result of the GPs' and patients' joint assessments of care need in each case. Depression severity was measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), quality of life with EQ-5D, and psychological well-being with the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Data on sick leave, antidepressant and sedatives use, and care contacts were collected from electronic patient records. All variables were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Mean intra-individual changes were compared between the intervention and TAU group. ## Results There were no significant differences between the intervention and control group in depression severity reduction or remission rate, change in quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative prescriptions, or sick leave during the whole 12-month follow-up. However, significantly more patients in the intervention group continued antidepressants until the 6 month follow-up (86/125 vs 78/133, *p* < 0.05). ## Conclusions When GPs used a depression self-rating scale in recurrent consultations, patients more often continued antidepressant medication according to guidelines, compared to TAU patients. However, reduction of depressive symptoms, remission rate, quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative use, sick leave, and health care use 4-12 months was not significantly different from the TAU group. These findings suggest that frequent use of depression rating scales in person-centred primary care consultations has no further additional effect on patients' depression or well-being, sick leave, or health care use. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: [NCT01402206](#).

      "^¤^*TAU* treatment as usual:::: There was a statistically significant difference between participants and drop-outs during the study concerning age (mean age 44.3 in participants, mean age 37.3 in drop-outs, *p* = 0.02), gender (male 14/62, 22.6%, female 16/166, 9.6%, *p* = 0.034), and ethnicity (born in Sweden 21/194, 10.8%, and born outside Sweden 9/32, 28.1%, *p* = 0.035) Figures [2](#), [3](#), and [4](#) shows depression symptoms (BDI-II), quality of life (EQ-5D), and overall psychological well-being (GHQ-12) in intervention and TAU groups at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months (boxplots). All patients who participated in the study, both those in the intervention and those in the TAU group, improved in all three variables between baseline and 3 months but there were no significant differences in mean changes (mean of intra-individual ∆) between the groups. Improvements were substantial in both groups; at the 3-month follow-up, nearly half the patients no longer had depression (BDI <13) (49% in the intervention and 47.3% in the TAU group, *p* = 0.89). We also performed logistic regression analyses. The models showed that at the 12-month follow-up, older age was associated with improved BDI-II score (OR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.99), and a higher level of education was associated with improved EQ-5D score (OR 3.9, CI 1.77-8.73). The factors added to the model (sex, age, education, antidepressant medication, and participation in the intervention or TAU group) explained the same amount of variation in both the intervention and TAU groups. Thus, the difference between the groups remained non-significant (data not shown).

      "# Abstract ## Purpose Actinic keratosis lesions (AKs) have the potential to develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and thus therapies to prevent SCC development from AKs are warranted. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a 3 month application of a canola phenolic acid-based cream (CPA) on AK lesions. ## Patients and methods This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 week clinical study conducted at a single-center in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Forty-five subjects (30 CPA and 15 placebo), aged 45--85 years with 3--10 AKs within a 20 cm^2^ treatment area (scalp, forehead, dorsal forearm, neck, or back of hand) were enrolled. The primary outcome was complete or partial lesion clearance and the secondary outcome was safety of CPA. ## Results Although complete AK lesion clearance was not seen in this study, a significant reduction in the mean change from baseline in the average lesion area was observed at weeks 3 ( *P*=0.002), 6 (*P*<0.001), and 12 (*P*<0.001) in the CPA group, but only at weeks 6 and 12 in the placebo group (*P*=0.005 and *P*=0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the proportion of participants with a $10% decrease in average lesion area was significantly higher in the CPA group than the placebo group at weeks 3 (*P*=0.05) and 6 (*P*=0.02), and showed a trend at week 12 (*P*=0.06). A subset analysis of the change in average lesion area based upon the total lesion area at baseline revealed that CPA elicited a greater reduction than placebo (2×) in participants with a baseline total AK lesion area of 100--500 mm^2^ than in participants with a total area <100 mm^2^ (1.3×). ## Conclusion The results of this study and previous in vitro studies suggest a potential role for CPA in the treatment of AK lesions and the prevention of SCC development. # Results ## Participant disposition Forty-five eligible subjects (four male and 41 female) were randomized and 42 completed the study ([Figure 1](#)). Three of the 45 participants did not complete the entire treatment period because of loss to follow-up (N=1) or AEs (N=2) ([Figure 1](#)). All enrolled participants were white Hispanic except for one participant of Asian ethnicity. Participants ranged from 45 to 82 years of age and the mean age of those on CPA was 60.0±10.8 years and those on placebo 55.7±9.1 years ([Table 1](#)). All study participants had mild AK lesions and two participants in the CPA group had two moderate lesions along with mild lesions. There was no difference in body mass index, average AK lesion area or total lesion area between the treatment groups at baseline ([Table 1](#)). ## Efficacy of CPA Although none of the study participants achieved complete clearance, decreases in average lesion area were seen with both CPA and placebo treatment ([Figure 2](#)). The CPA group showed almost twice the decrease in lesion size as the placebo group ([Figure 3](#)). The reduction was significant for both CPA and placebo groups at 6 (*P*<0.001 and *P*=0.005, respectively) and 12 weeks (*P*<0.001 and *P*=0.002, respectively), but only significant in the CPA group at 3 weeks (*P*=0.002). The difference in the week 6 change between the CPA and placebo groups approached statistical significance ( *P*=0.09). There was a decrease in average lesion area from week 12 to week 36 (post-treatment) in the CPA group (week 36 assessment was not performed in the placebo group), indicating that the improvement in the CPA group persisted beyond the treatment period ([Figures 2](#) and [3](#)). In the two participants with moderate lesions in the CPA group, lesions decreased to mild in severity at week 6, week 12, and follow-up at week 36. A greater proportion of participants in the CPA group than the placebo group showed a >10% decrease in average lesion size at week 3 (*P*=0.05) and week 6 (*P*=0.02) and showed a trend toward significance at week 12 ( *P*=0.06) ([Figure 4](#)). No difference was seen between the groups in the proportion of participants with>25% reduction in the average lesion size, but >50% reductions were observed only in the CPA group ([Figure 4](#)). Subset analyses based upon the baseline total lesion area (<100 mm^2^, 100--249 mm^2^ and 250--499 mm^2^) showed differences in treatment response within certain total lesion size groups. Participants in the CPA group with a total lesion area <100 mm^2^ demonstrated a 1.3× greater mean reduction in average lesion size than placebo (data not shown). Similarly, greater responses were observed for participants in the CPA group compared to placebo for total lesion areas 101--250 mm^2^ (1.9× reduction) and 251--500 mm ^2^ (2.0× reduction). The CPA group showed a trend toward higher prevalence of lesion scabbing, a sign of healing, after 12 weeks of treatment (6.8%) than those treated with placebo (1.3%, *P*=0.09). An analysis of lesion age on responsiveness to treatment suggests that CPA and placebo had comparable reductions in the average lesion area. Although these differences were not statistically significant, the number of years since lesion onset was found to influence the extent of lesion resolution. Average lesion area was examined for participants with lesion onset of ≤5 years, 5--10 years, ≤10 years, and >10 years. Greater reductions in lesion size were seen in the CPA group than the placebo group for all subsets and was found to be more pronounced in participants with lesion onset ≤10 years compared to those with onset >10 years (data not shown). ## Safety analysis One serious adverse event, a parasitic amoeba infection was reported during this study in a participant receiving placebo. A total of 56 AEs (45 CPA, eleven placebo) were reported in 30 (20 CPA, ten placebo) out of the 45 participants in the safety population (30 CPA, 15 placebo). There were ten events (nine CPA, one placebo) among four participants (three CPA, one placebo) that were judged by the principal investigator to be probably or possibly related to the study product. Of these, five were skin-related, and the other five were eye, gastrointestinal, general, immune, and vascular disorders. The skin-related disorders occurred in three participants, two in the CPA group, and one in the placebo group. This difference was not statistically significant. Blood pressure was significantly reduced compared to baseline by a mean of 7.8 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (*P*=0.01) and a mean of 4.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (*P*<0.001) after 6 weeks of treatment with CPA. These changes were not clinically significant. No between-group differences were noted for heart rate, blood pressure or safety laboratory parameters with the exception of sodium concentration and red blood cell count. Sodium and red blood cell count were both significantly decreased in the CPA group as compared to the placebo group (*P*=0.02 and *P*=0.03, respectively). However, these changes were of small magnitude and not clinically important. No safety concerns were raised throughout the course of this study.\n",
      "# Abstract ## Introduction In a previous pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical studies conducted by Merck, which included data available as of July 2009 on 10,246 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), treatment with sitagliptin was shown to be generally well tolerated compared with treatment with control agents. As the sitagliptin clinical development program continues, additional studies with sitagliptin have been completed. The present analysis updates the safety and tolerability assessment of sitagliptin by examining pooled data from 25 double-blind clinical studies. ## Methods The present analysis included data from 14,611 patients in 25 studies with T2DM who received either sitagliptin 100 mg/day (*n* = 7,726; sitagliptin group) or a comparator agent (*n* = 6,885; non-exposed group). These studies represent all randomized, double-blind trials conducted by Merck that included patients treated with the usual clinical dose of sitagliptin (100 mg/day) for between 12 weeks and 2 years, and for which results were available as of December 2011. These studies assessed sitagliptin, versus comparator agents, taken as monotherapy, initial combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, or as add-on combination therapy with other antihyperglycemic agents (metformin, pioglitazone, a sulfonylurea ± metformin, insulin ± metformin, or metformin + pioglitazone or rosiglitazone). Patient-level data from each study were used to evaluate between-group differences in the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events (AEs). ## Results Overall incidence rates of AEs and drug-related AEs were higher in the non-exposed group compared with the sitagliptin group. Incidence rates of specific AEs were generally similar between the two groups, except for higher incidence rates of hypoglycemia related to the greater use of a sulfonylurea and diarrhea related to the greater use of metformin in the non-exposed group, and of constipation in the sitagliptin group. Treatment with sitagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancy, or pancreatitis. ## Conclusion In this updated pooled safety analysis of data from 14,611 patients with T2DM, sitagliptin 100 mg/day was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 2 years in duration. # Results ## Patient Characteristics and Exposure In the entire 25-study cohort, patients (55% male) had an mean age of 54 years (range 19--91 years; 17% ≥65 years), a mean duration of diabetes of 5.1 years, and a mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 8.4% at baseline (with 29% of patients having a baseline HbA1c ≥9.0%) (Table [1](#)). The majority of patients were White (61%), with 18% Asian and 6% Black. At baseline, 10% of patients had a history of cardiovascular disease, and 81% had additional cardiovascular risk factors besides type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, including hypertension (53%), history of dyslipidemia/hypercholesterolemia (49%), and history of smoking (39%). There were no meaningful differences between groups in these baseline characteristics. ::::table-wrap\n",

In the sitagliptin group, 2,457 (32%) patients were treated for at least 1 year, with 584 (8%) of these patients treated for 2 years; the corresponding numbers of patients in the non-exposed group were 1,775 (26%) and 470 (7%).

The incidence rate of drug-related adverse events was also higher in the non-exposed group, as was the incidence of patient discontinuations due to a drug-related adverse event; this was primarily due to the greater incidence rate of adverse events of drug-related hypoglycemia reported for the non-exposed group (data not shown). The incidence of serious adverse events was similar for the two groups, both overall (Table [2](#)) and by SOC category (data not shown). The incidence of adverse events resulting in death, overall, was similar in the two treatment groups; for the Neoplasms SOC, however, the incidence of adverse events resulting in death was lower in the sitagliptin group compared with the non-exposed group (one event in 6,388 patient-years of follow-up compared with six events in 5,378 patient-years of follow-up, respectively, with a difference in rates of −0.1 events per 100-patient-years (95% CI −0.2, −0.0). ::::table-wrap\n",

The between-group difference in the incidence rates of adverse events in the Metabolism and nutrition disorders SOC was primarily due to a higher incidence rate of hypoglycemia in the non-exposed group. The between-group difference in the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC was related to a higher incidence rate in the sitagliptin group for non-malignant adverse events within the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC, and was not the result of an imbalance in any single adverse event or any group of biologically related adverse events. The incidence rates of malignancy were similar for the two groups: 0.90 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin group and 0.93 per 100 patient-years in the non-exposed group [between-group difference of −0.05 (95% CI −0.41, 0.30)].

The predefined analysis for hypoglycemia (i.e., excluding data after initiation of glycemic rescue therapy) showed a between-group difference of −6.2 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI −7.6, −5.0), favoring the sitagliptin group. The difference observed for hypoglycemia was mainly due to the use of a sulfonylurea as a comparator agent in three studies of up to 2 years in duration, as well as a study in which patients were switched from placebo to a sulfonylurea during a double-blind continuation period (P020 in Table [6](#) in Appendix). Results from some individual studies included in this pooled analysis (in which sitagliptin was added to either a sulfonylurea with or without metformin or to insulin with or without metformin) demonstrated an increased risk for hypoglycemia with sitagliptin used in combination with these agents relative to placebo. In a separate pooled analysis of hypoglycemia in which confounding effects of a sulfonylurea or insulin as either background or comparator therapies were removed, the incidence rates of hypoglycemia were 5.6 and 5.1 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin (*n* = 5,956) and non-exposed (*n* = 5,122) groups, respectively, with a between-group difference of 0.5 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI −0.7, 1.6). ### GI Symptoms The primary analysis of select GI adverse events demonstrated similar incidence rates for the pooled select GI terms, the composite of abdominal pain terms, nausea, and vomiting (Table [4](#)). The incidence rate of the adverse event of constipation was higher in the sitagliptin group (2.3) than in the non-exposed group (1.8). For the specific adverse event of diarrhea, a lower incidence was observed in the sitagliptin group. The differences observed for diarrhea mainly reflected the use of metformin as a comparator; when the confounding effects of initiation of metformin were removed, the incidence rates were 4.3 and 4.9 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin (*n* = 5,940) and non-exposed (*n* = 5,122) groups, respectively. ::::table-wrap\n",

The exposure-adjusted incidence of MACE was 0.65 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin group, and 0.74 per 100 patient-years in the non-exposed group, with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.83 (95% CI 0.53, 1.30). ### Neoplasms As noted above, the analysis of all events of malignancies revealed similar incidences in the two treatment groups: 0.90 per 100 patient years in the sitagliptin group and 0.93 per 100 patient-years in the non-exposed group [between-group difference of −0.05 (95% CI −0.41, 0.30)]. Low incidence rates of a wide range of specific malignancies were reported, with similar rates in both treatment groups; the 95% CI did not exclude zero for any of the specific malignancies that were reported. The most common malignancies observed were basal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer (Table [8](#) in Appendix). Analyses were performed for the pool of terms representing the category of pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma of pancreas, pancreatic carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma metastatic). The exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the pooled terms related to the category of pancreatic cancer were similar in the two treatment groups (0.05 and 0.06 events per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively). The number of adverse events (three in each group) was below the pre-defined threshold for calculating a 95% CI. The incidence rate of adverse events in the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC overall was 2.03 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin group and 1.52 per 100 patient-years in the non-exposed group [between-group difference of 0.52 (95% CI 0.03, 1.01)]. The higher rate in the sitagliptin group was related to a higher rate of non-malignant neoplasms in the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC [incidence rates of 1.18 and 0.60 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively; between-group difference of 0.60 (95% CI 0.25, 0.96)]. This difference was not the result of an imbalance in any single adverse event or any group of biologically related adverse events. The most common non-malignant neoplasm adverse event terms observed were uterine leiomyoma/leiomyoma, lipoma, and skin papilloma. The only term for which the 95% CI around the between-group difference excluded zero was lipoma [between-group difference 0.15 (95% CI 0.02, 0.29)]. A sensitivity analysis, performed to assess the incidence of non-malignant neoplasms across any SOC, revealed a similar pattern, with incidences of 1.58 and 1.12 per 100 patient-years in the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively [between-group difference of 0.45 (95% CI 0.02, 0.89)]; in this sensitivity analysis, the adverse event term \"colonic polyp\" was the most common, with similar incidences in the two treatment groups (0.25 and 0.26 per 100-patient years, respectively). ### Angioedema At baseline, 29.4% and 28.1% of sitagliptin-treated and non-exposed patients, respectively, were treated with ACE inhibitors. In the subgroup defined by ACE inhibitor use, the exposure-adjusted incidence of events was 0.99 per 100-patient-years in the sitagliptin group and 1.35 per 100-patient-years in the non-exposed group; for those patients not treated with ACE inhibitors, the incidence rates were 1.14 and 1.16, respectively. ### Other Composite Endpoints The following composite endpoints, primarily of interest due to theoretical mechanistic concerns and/or post-marketing case reports, were analyzed. For the composite endpoint of pancreatitis (which included the MedDRA terms \"pancreatitis\" and \"pancreatitis acute\"), the incidence rates were similar for both groups (Table [4](#)), with a difference in rate of −0.0 (95% CI −0.2, 0.1). A similar pattern was observed with an expanded composite that included the MedDRA term \"pancreatitis chronic\". The incidence of acute renal failure was assessed using both the narrow SMQ and the broad SMQ (Table [4](#)); low and similar rates were observed in both treatment groups for both composite endpoints, as well as for the composite endpoint of proteinuria, which comprised the MedDRA terms \"albumin urine present\" or \"protein urine present\". Separate analyses were done on the composite endpoints of bronchitis, pneumonia, and upper respiratory infection (Table [4](#)). Similar incidences were seen in both treatment groups for all three of these infection composites. Similar incidence rates were also observed for the composite endpoint of urinary tract infections (with or without cystitis). The incidence of the composite endpoint of rash was higher in the sitagliptin group compared with the non-exposed group (Table [4](#)). The difference in the composite endpoint was primarily related to a higher incidence of the individual terms \"rash\" and \"rash macular\". The incidence of the individual adverse event term \"atrial fibrillation\" was higher in the sitagliptin group (Table [4](#)). For the predefined composite endpoint of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, the between-group difference was 0.2 event per 100 patient-years, and the 95% CI did not exclude zero (95% CI −0.0, 0.4). ## Specific Adverse Events for which CI Excluded Zero The incidences of adverse events for which the 95% CI excluded zero are depicted in Table [5](#). There were 17 specific adverse events in which the incidence was higher in the sitagliptin group, and 23 specific adverse events in which the incidence was higher in the non-exposed group. For those adverse events in which the between-group difference was ≥0.5 events per 100 patient-years, there were two (constipation and dyspepsia) and seven (diarrhea, fatigue, edema peripheral, blood glucose decreased, hypoglycemia, blood glucose increased, and weight increased) in which the incidences were higher in the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively. Apart from the adverse event of hypoglycemia, the between-group differences in adverse events for which the 95% CI excluded zero were all less than 1.5 events per 100 patient-years. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract This pilot study evaluates the degree of side effects during high-dose chemotherapy (HD-VIC) plus autologous bone marrow transplant (HDCT) and its possible prevention by the cytoprotective thiol-derivate amifostine. Additionally, the in-patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared. 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD-VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine (910 mg/m^2^ at day 1--3) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide. Patients were stratified according to pretreatment. HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin (500 mg/m^2/^d over 18 h), ifosfamide (4 g/m^2^/d over 4 h) and etoposide (500 mg/m^2^/d) all given for 3 consecutive days. All patients received prophylactic application of G-CSF (5 μg kg^−1^ subcutaneously) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment. Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, haematopoietic recovery, as well as frequency of fever and infections. The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10% from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min^−1^) and 37% in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min^−1^) (*P*< 0.01). Amifostine-treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion. Stomatitis grade III/IV occurred in 25% without versus 0% of patients with amifostine (*P* = 0.01). Acute nausea/vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT~3~-receptor antagonists/dexamethasone/trifluorpromazine. However, delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients. Engraftment of neutrophil (> 500 μl^−1^) and thrombocytes (> 25 000 μl^−1^)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12, respectively, both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm. In addition, a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm. The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30% savings in costs for supportive care (Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient). Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine, calculation of in-patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm. This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD-VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine. Additionally, a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine-treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned. Larger randomized trials evaluating amifostine cytoprotection during high-dose chemotherapy are warranted. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [http://www.bjcancer.com](#)\n",
      "# Abstract ## Aims This post hoc assessment evaluated the efficacy and safety of once‐daily, prandial glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist lixisenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90  mL /min), or mild (60‐89  mL /min) or moderate (30‐59  mL /min) renal impairment. ## Methods Patients from 9 lixisenatide trials in the GetGoal clinical trial programme were categorized by baseline creatinine clearance: normal renal function (lixisenatide n = 2094, placebo n = 1150); renal impairment (mild: lixisenatide n = 637, placebo n = 414; moderate: lixisenatide n = 122, placebo n = 68). Meta‐analyses of placebo‐adjusted mean differences between baseline renal categories were performed for efficacy and safety outcomes. ## Results HbA1c, 2‐hour postprandial plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose were comparably reduced in lixisenatide‐treated patients with normal renal function, and mild and moderate renal impairment. The most common adverse events ( AEs ) in all renal function categories were gastrointestinal ( GI ), predominantly nausea and vomiting. A 14% higher incidence of GI AEs and a 10% higher incidence of nausea and vomiting were seen with mild impairment vs normal function ( P= .003 for both), but no significant differences were observed between the mild and moderate impairment categories ( P= .99 and P= .57, respectively), or between the moderate impairment and normal categories ( P= .16 and P= .65, respectively). Additionally, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar in all categories. ## Conclusions This study demonstrates that baseline renal status does not affect efficacy outcomes in lixisenatide‐ vs placebo‐treated patients, and that no lixisenatide dose adjustment is required for patients with T2D with mild or moderate renal impairment. # RESULTS ## Patient demographics and clinical characteristics at baseline The distribution of patients in the combined safety population by renal function category and a summary of patient characteristics at baseline is given in Table [2](#) . ::::table-wrap\n",

Within the safety population, 3244 patients were classified as having normal renal function, 1051 patients had a mild renal impairment and 190 patients a moderate renal impairment. No patient had severe renal impairment at baseline in the lixisenatide group. The majority of patients were white and <65 years old, with approximately half of the patients having HbA1c ≥8% (64 mmol/mol) at baseline (Table [2](#) ). Baseline rates of microalbuminuria, an indicator of diabetic nephropathy, were generally low and similar across all studies and both treatment arms included in the analysis ( *P* = .80 for heterogeneity). ## Comparisons of changes in efficacy variables from baseline to study end within baseline renal function categories Of the five efficacy variables evaluated in this analysis, placebo‐adjusted mean differences in HbA1c, 2‐hour PPG and FPG were significantly lower at study end in lixisenatide‐ than in placebo‐treated patients in all three renal function categories (Table [3](#) ). ::::table-wrap\n",

In both the normal renal function and the mild impairment categories, end‐of‐treatment basal insulin dose was significantly lower with lixisenatide than with placebo. However, in the moderate renal impairment category there was no significant difference between lixisenatide and placebo in basal insulin dose. End‐of‐treatment body weight was significantly lower compared with baseline in both the normal renal function and the mild impairment categories. Body weight loss was also observed in the moderate renal impairment category, but this did not reach statistical significance. ## Meta‐analysis of changes in efficacy variables between renal function categories Comparisons of normal vs mild renal function and mild vs moderate renal function were performed to examine the incremental effect of increasing renal impairment on efficacy measures, while the direct comparison of normal vs moderate renal function demonstrates the cumulative effect. When between‐category changes for normal vs mild renal impairment and mild vs moderate renal impairment were assessed across the studies, there was no significant difference in HbA1c reductions at study end for patients with normal renal function vs those with mild renal impairment ( *P* = .58), between patients with mild and moderate renal impairment ( *P* = .36), or between patients with normal and moderate renal impairment ( *P* = .20; Figure [1](#) a). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Placebo‐adjusted meta‐analysis of change in A , HbA1c ; B , 2‐hour PPG and C, FPG from baseline to week 24 (week 12 for GetGoal‐Mono ) between renal function categories in patients receiving lixisenatide.

There were 14 SOCs that met this criterion: gastrointestinal (GI) disorders; nervous system disorders; general disorders and administration‐site conditions; musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; skin and subcutaneous tissues disorders; metabolism and nutrition disorders; psychiatric disorders; cardiac disorders; injury, poisoning and procedural disorders; renal and urinary disorders; eye disorder investigations; respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; and infections and infestations. There were no significant differences between the normal and mild impairment or between the normal and moderate impairment renal function categories, with the exception of the GI disorders and metabolism and nutrition disorders (Table [4](#) ). The most common AEs in all renal function categories were GI‐related, predominantly nausea and vomiting. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Introduction Governments throughout the world are using or considering various front-of-package (FOP) food labeling systems to provide nutrition information to consumers. Our web-based study tested consumer understanding of different FOP labeling systems. ## Methods Adult participants (N = 480) were randomized to 1 of 5 groups to evaluate FOP labels: 1) no label; 2) multiple traffic light (MTL); 3) MTL plus daily caloric requirement icon (MTL+caloric intake); 4) traffic light with specific nutrients to limit based on food category (TL+SNL); or 5) the Choices logo. Total percentage correct quiz scores were created reflecting participants' ability to select the healthier of 2 foods and estimate amounts of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium in foods. Participants also rated products on taste, healthfulness, and how likely they were to purchase the product. Quiz scores and product perceptions were compared with 1-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Tukey tests. ## Results The MTL+caloric intake group (mean [standard deviation], 73.3% [6.9%]) and Choices group (72.5% [13.2%]) significantly outperformed the no label group (67.8% [10.3%]) and the TL+SNL group (65.8% [7.3%]) in selecting the more healthful product on the healthier product quiz. The MTL and MTL+caloric intake groups achieved average scores of more than 90% on the saturated fat, sugar, and sodium quizzes, which were significantly better than the no label and Choices group average scores, which were between 34% and 47%. ## Conclusion An MTL+caloric intake label and the Choices symbol hold promise as FOP labeling systems and require further testing in different environments and population subgroups. # Results ## Study outcomes ### Healthier product quiz Participant scores for the healthier product quiz varied significantly among groups ([Table 2](#)). The Choices group outperformed the no label group (Cohen's *d* = 0.40, *P* = .005) as did the MTL+caloric intake label group (*d* = 0.62, *P* < .001). The TL+SNL group had fewer correct answers than the Choices group (*d* = 0.63, *P* < .001), the MTL group (*d* = 0.69, *P* = .001), and the MTL+caloric intake group (*d* = 1.06, *P* < .001). ::::table-wrap\n",

All 3 TL groups significantly outperformed the no label and Choices groups (*P* < .001 for all TL comparisons). Cohen's *d* effect sizes for the control group versus the TL groups were as follows: MTL, *d* = 3.09; MTL+caloric intake, *d* = 3.70; and TL+SNL, *d* = 1.90. The 2 MTL groups had significantly higher scores than all other groups. There were also significant differences among study groups on the sugars and sodium quizzes, which were similar to the pattern of findings for the saturated fat quiz. ### Accuracy of calories-per-serving estimate The 4 label groups significantly differed on ability to estimate calories per serving ([Table 3](#)). All 3 TL groups led to more accurate calories-per-serving estimates compared with the Choices and no-label groups: MTL, *d* = 0.73; MTL+caloric intake, *d* = 0.77; TL+SNL, *d* = 0.75; (*P* < .001 for all comparisons). Only 17% of participants provided an incorrect estimate of recommended daily caloric intake, which did not differ across group (χ^2^~4~) = 7.0, *P* = .14). ::::table-wrap\n",

The Choices group performed better than the control group on estimating saturated fat (*P* < .001), sodium (*P* < .01), and calories (*P* < .004), but performed significantly worse on these outcomes than all 3 TL groups (*P* < .001) ([Table 3](#)).\n",
      "# Abstract ## Introduction The preventive impact of hospital-acquired infection (HAI) surveillance is difficult to assess. Our objective was to investigate the effect of HAI surveillance disruption on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence. ## Methods A quasi-experimental study with an intervention group and a control group was conducted between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2010 in two intensive care units (ICUs) of a university hospital that participated in a national HAI surveillance network. Surveillance was interrupted during the year 2007 in unit A (intervention group) and was continuous in unit B (control group). Period 1 (pre-test period) comprised patients hospitalized during 2004 to 2006, and period 2 (post-test period) involved patients hospitalized during 2008 to 2010. Patients hospitalized ≥48 hours and intubated during their stay were included. Multivariate Poisson regression was fitted to ascertain the influence of surveillance disruption. ## Results A total of 2,771 patients, accounting for 19,848 intubation-days at risk, were studied; 307 had VAP. The VAP attack rate increased in unit A from 7.8% during period 1 to 17.1% during period 2 (*P* <0.001); in unit B, it was 7.2% and 11.2% for the two periods respectively (*P* = 0.17). Adjusted VAP incidence rose in unit A after surveillance disruption (incidence rate ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.47, *P* = 0.036), independently of VAP trend; no change was observed in unit B. All-cause mortality and length of stay increased (*P* = 0.028 and *P* = 0.038, respectively) in unit A between periods 1 and 2. In unit B, no change in mortality was observed (*P* = 0.22), while length of stay decreased between periods 1 and 2 (*P* = 0.002). ## Conclusions VAP incidence, length of stay and all-cause mortality rose after HAI surveillance disruption in ICU, which suggests a specific effect of HAI surveillance on VAP prevention and reinforces the role of data feedback and counselling as a mechanism to facilitate performance improvement. # Results ## Study participants Of the 4,411 patients included in the surveillance of both units during the study period, 2,915 (61.1%) were exposed to mechanical ventilation during their hospital stay. Data were missing for 4.9% (n = 144) of intubated patients and were, therefore, excluded. Totally, 2,771 patients, accounting for 37,330 hospitalisation days, 26,768 intubation-days and 19,848 intubation-days at risk, were analysed. Among them, 940 (34%) were hospitalised in unit A, and 1,831 (66%) in unit B. Overall, 62% (n = 1,724) were men, and mean ± SD age was 60 ± 16 years. Totally, 61% (n = 1,694) received antibiotics at admission, 41% (n = 1,142) came from home, and 26% (n = 721) were immunosuppressed. Mean ± SD SAPSII score was 53 ± 20. All-cause in-hospital mortality was 26% (n = 712). Overall, 307 patients had VAP. The VAP attack rate was 11.1 per 100 intubated patients and the VAP incidence rate was 15.5 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 13.8 to 17.3) per 1,000 intubation-days at risk. ## Characteristics by group and period Table [1](#) reports the characteristics of hospitalised patients by group and period. In the intervention group with surveillance interrupted in 2007, patients hospitalised during period 2 compared to period 1 more often came from home (*P* = 0.004), were more immunosuppressed (*P* <0.001), more often had surgery as diagnosis category (*P* <0.001), received antibiotics less frequently at admission (*P* <.001), were older (*P* = 0.022), and presented lower mean SAPSII (*P* <0.001). In the control group with continuous surveillance, patients hospitalised during period 2 compared to period 1 were less likely to come from home (*P* <0.001), were more immunosuppressed (*P* <0.001), and received antibiotics more frequently at admission (*P* <0.001). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background During laparoscopy, insufflation of an inert gas in the peritoneal cavity creates a working space to facilitate surgery. The space should be large enough to facilitate surgery without increasing intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) over a threshold limit (usually 15 mm Hg). ## Objectives This experimental study was performed to evaluate the effects of increasing in intra-abdominal pressure on internal organs. ## Materials and Methods Twenty female mixed breed dogs (20 ± 3 kg, 18 ± 1.2 months) were selected. They were randomly divided to two groups (n = 10). The intra-abdominal pressure was maintained 12 mm Hg and 20 mm Hg during the operation in control group and in test group respectively. ## Results Histopathologic evaluations revealed more pathological changes at the kidney of all the dogs in test group in comparison to control group. ## Conclusions Our findings revealed that organs that their blood supplies are related to one single or two arteries and their blood drainage are related to one or two veins are more sensitive to increased intra-abdominal pressure. # 4. Results There were no differences between dogs in body weight, age and the procedure of general anesthesia. In heart rate evaluation at equal intervals, no significant differences were observed over time between the two groups. Also in respiratory rate, there were no significant differences (P>0.05). Results of end tidal CO ~2~ measurements did not show severe hypoventilation during anesthesia in both groups. Comparison of this data between groups did not show any significant difference (P > 0.05). The mean of hemoglobin saturation measurements in the two groups did not show any significant difference (P > 0.05). Histopathologic evaluations revealed pathological changes at the kidney of all the dogs in test group (intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg) ( [Figure 1](#) ) in comparison to control group (intra-abdominal pressure: 12 mm Hg) ( [Figure 2](#) ). These pathological changes included: coagulation necrosis, glomerulonephritis and fatty changes. Fatty changes were stronger at distal tubules in comparison with proximal tubules. The pathologic changes at the liver were similar in both groups and were mild. These changes included mild coagulation necrosis in the parenchyma, hyperplasia at the smooth muscles and congestion. The differences between two groups were not significant. The pathologic change that was significant in test group at the pancreases was acinar necrosis. This change was observed only in samples of test group. Any pathologic change at the spleen was not detected in two groups. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Pancreas Acinar Necrosis<br /> (a) normal acinar histological section of pancreas (control group), (b) acinar necrosis histopathological section of pancreas (test group; intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg).</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Kidney Histopathological Changes<br /> (a) Normal renal cortex histological section (control group), (b) necrosis of renal cortex (test group; intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg), (c) normal medullary tubules (test group; intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg), (d) more sever necrosis of renal cortex (test group; intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg).</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background To investigate whether cumulus cell removal after a 3 h co-incubation of gametes can affect the outcomes of in vitro fertilization. ## Methods A prospective randomized sibling-oocyte study was performed in which sibling oocytes obtained from each patient were randomly assigned to either a 3 h or 20 h group (cumulus cells removed at 3 h or 20 h after insemination, respectively). Same origin embryos (either 3 h or 20 h) were transferred. The study participants were patients < 38 years old and with infertility due to tubal factors. The study outcomes included fertilization, embryo quality, and birth status. ## Results The study enrolled 172 patients, from whom 2275 oocytes were retrieved (1139 oocytes for the 3 h group and 1136 oocytes for the 20 h group). A total of 134 patients received embryo transfers (74 patients in the 3 h group and 60 patients in the 20 h group), and there were 54 live births (32 in the 3 h group and 22 in the 20 h group). When compared with patients in the 20 h group, patients in the 3 h group produced a larger number of optimal quality embryos, but had higher rates of polyspermy and low birth weight newborns. The two groups showed no differences in their rates of normal fertilization, pregnancy, and live birth. ## Conclusions When compared with results obtained using a traditional cumulus cell removal protocol, early cumulus cell removal has both advantages and disadvantages. Further studies, and especially long-term outcome studies on newborns, need to be performed. ## Trial registration Current controlled trial [ChiCTR-OOC-15006878](#) # Results The study recruited 172 patients; among whom, 134 patients were analyzed (Fig. [1](#), 74 patients in the 3 h group and 60 patients in the 20 h group). The mean age of the patients was 29.7 years (30.3 ± 3.7 years in the 3 h group and 29.3 ± 2.7 years in the 20 h group). The numbers of treatment cycles in the 3 h and 20 h groups were 1.0 ± 0.2 and 1.1 ± 0.4, respectively. Thirty patients were excluded due to either cancelled cycles (3 patients) or mixed embryo transfers (27 patients). Eight patients were not included in the statistical analysis because they received early rescue ICSI. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>CONSORT flow diagram</figcaption> </figure> The fertilization, embryo, and pregnancy outcomes are shown in Tables [1](#), [2](#), and [3](#). When compared with the 20 h group, the 3 h group had a significantly higher polyspermy rate and percentage of optimal embryos. An analysis on obstetric outcomes showed that low birth weight infants were more common in the 3 h group (Table [4](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract # Results ## Sample demographics Participants (n = 190) were recruited from 40 states and all were licensed or certified to conduct substance abuse treatment. Certified drug and alcohol providers comprised 33% of the sample, 31% were social workers, and were 18% Licensed Professional Counselors, with the remaining 18% in various other disciplines such as psychologists, physicians and nurses. Participants reported that they spent, on average, 25.62 (SD = 11.16) h per week treating clients with substance use disorders. Women comprised 62% of the sample. Participants were 79.7% White, 5.9% Black or African American, 2.6% American Indian/Alaska Native, 0.7% Asian or Asian American, 5.9% Hispanic, 5.2% other backgrounds (See [Table 2](#) ). All participants were fluent in spoken and written English. The two groups were examined for differences in relevant baseline measures. Groups were equivalent with regard to all examined characteristics including gender, ethnicity, education, and experience. At baseline, there were no differences between groups on measures of clinician speech (e.g., MICO, reflection:question ratio, percent complex reflections; all p > 0.38) or client speech (change talk, sustain talk, percent CT; all p > 0.42). ## Participant attrition and follow up A total of 776 work samples were collected across all follow-up points. To ensure that the data reflected the effects of training enrichments, samples from participants who completed fewer than three consult calls were excluded. Samples that did not adhere to study criteria (i.e., role-played sessions, non-SUD target behaviors, more than seven sessions with same client) were similarly excluded, as were inaudible sessions. This resulted in a sample of 609 sessions, or 78.5% of all sessions submitted, with 81.7% at 3 months, 73.2% at 6 months and 51% at 12 months. After each follow-up, participants received global ratings of their MI proficiency based upon their MISC ratings of the submitted sample. There were no between-group differences on the number of work samples submitted at any follow-up (all p > 0.25), nor were there any differences between groups in the number of consult calls completed (t(189) = 0.404, p > 0.60, d = 0.0594). ## Interrater reliability estimates for coding of worksamples A subset of 72 randomly selected recordings (11.8%) were coded by the 6 coders completing the majority (84.7%) of all recordings. Intraclass correlations (ICC's) across all six coders for behavior counts ranged from 0.59 to 0.99 (Cicchetti, 1994). For this reliability sample, 34.7% of the total tapes were drawn from MIU, 65.3% from LEAF, (t(71) = 2.704, p < 0.01), indicating that despite random selection the LEAF condition was oversampled. Since the most challenging behaviors to code (RefCT, RefST) are more frequent in the LEAF condition, this disparity in the sampling may have resulted in an underestimate of the reliability of the coders for the entire sample of tapes. (See [Table 3](#) for all reliability estimates. ## Analysis plan Because outcome measures were nested within participants, multilevel modeling was used to assess the impact of the experimental manipulation. Our analyses examined client language both 1) at the 3 month follow up and 2) in all follow-up periods simultaneously. Mediation analyses focused on the 3 month follow up period. We used the PROCESS software (Hayes, 2013) to examine the relationship between group assignment and client language, mediated by the directional reflections of the providers (a strategy emphasized in the MI Leaf condition). We expected that group assignment (MI AU v MI Leaf) would predict the type of reflections used by participants in their follow up work samples (A path) and that directional reflections would predict client speech in those sessions (B path). Overall, we expected to see a relationship between group assignment and client speech (C path). ## Was there a training effect for the MI workshop? ### Knowledge test The MI Knowledge Test was used as the outcome measure to estimate the impact of training. It was administered at baseline and post-training, and results indicate a significant increase in MI knowledge (b = 0.111, SE = 0.015, t = 7.146, p < 0.001) for all participants with no significant differences between training conditions (b = −0.041, SE = 0.031, t = −1.328, p = 0.186). ### Frequency counts of outcome variables As expected, common MI skills that were common to both treatment conditions, such as providing complex reflections (b = 0.063, SE = 0.080, p = 0.43, CI[0.910--1.247] and asking open questions (b = −0.087, SE = 0.071, p = 0.221, CI[0.797--1.054], showed no significant differences between training conditions. ## Was there a difference in participants' reflections of client language in follow up sessions depending on training condition? Collapsing across all time points, the frequency of the participants' reflections of client CT did not differ between groups as hypothesized (b = 0.037, SE = 0.097, p = 0.703, 95% CI [−0.155 to 0.230], d = 0.062). However for reflections of ST, there was a significant difference such that participants in the LEAF-MI group gave fewer reflections of sustain talk than those in the MI-AU training (b = −0.257, SE = 0.114, p = 0.025, CI [−0.032 to 0.481], d = −0.369). ## Did the language of clients in follow up samples differ depending on training condition of the participants? For the 3 month follow up, the frequency of client CT did not differ significantly in the treatment sessions as a result of training condition, contradicting our hypothesis (b = −0.0857, SE = 0.0923, 95% CI [0.765, 1.102), T = −0.929, p = 0.355. However, ST was significantly lower for clients of participants trained in the MI-LEAF condition (b = −0.1008, SE = 0.0179, 95% CI [0.873, 0.937), T = −5.629, p < 0.001) as hypothesized. This pattern was the same, but less robust, when collapsing across all time points. Frequency of client CT did not differ significantly between the training groups, (b = −0.018, SE = 0.064, p = 0.781, CI [−0.0145, 0.110], T = −0.279, p = 0.781 However, ST was significantly lower for the clients of participants trained in the LEAF-MI condition (b = −0.175, SE = 0.087, p = 0.046, CI [−0.347, 0.003], T = −2.01, p = 0.046). ## Is there evidence for a causal chain implicating specialized training, resulting participant's reflections of client language and the frequencies of client language at the three-month follow-up? A priori mediation analyses focusing on change talk were not significant (K2 = 0.0295, bootstrap SE = 0.0556, 95% CI [0.000, 0.912]). For sustain talk, however, the causal chain for a) training and b) subsequent participant focus on sustain talk in follow up sessions and c) client sustain talk during those same sessions was significant (K2 = 0.0833, bootstrap SE = 0.0394, 95% CI [0.0148, 0.1691]). Specifically, group assignment (C path) predicted client speech in follow up sessions, but this was mediated by the type of reflections used by the provider (B path) such that those who had been trained in the MI Leaf condition offered fewer reflections of sustain talk (A path) (See [Table 4](#) ).

      "# Abstract ## Background Limited information has been published regarding how specific processes for event adjudication can affect event rates in trials. We reviewed nonfatal myocardial infarctions (MIs) reported by site investigators in the international Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin (Eptifibatide) Therapy (PURSUIT) trial and those adjudicated by a central clinical events committee (CEC) to determine the reasons for differences in event rates. ## Methods The PURSUIT trial randomised 10,948 patients with acute coronary syndromes to receive eptifibatide or placebo. The primary end-point was death or post-enrolment MI at 30 days as assessed by the CEC; this end-point was also constructed using site-reported events. The CEC identified suspected MIs by systematic review of clinical, cardiac enzyme, and electrocardiographic data. ## Results The CEC identified 5005 (46%) suspected events, of which 1415 (28%) were adjudicated as MI. The site investigator and CEC assessments of whether a MI had occurred disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients with suspected MI, mostly reflecting site misclassification of post-enrolment MIs (as enrolment MIs) or underreported periprocedural MIs. Patients for whom the CEC and site investigator agreed that no end-point MI had occurred had the lowest mortality at 30 days and between 30 days and 6 months, and those with agreement that a MI had occurred had the highest mortality. ## Conclusion CEC adjudication provides a standard, systematic, independent, and unbiased assessment of end-points, particularly for trials that span geographic regions and clinical practice settings. Understanding the review process and reasons for disagreement between CEC and site investigator assessments of MI is important to design future trials and interpret event rates between trials. # Results ## Incidence of disagreement Overall, 5005 (46%) patients with possible or suspected MI were identified and adjudicated by the CEC. The CEC identified more patients with end-point events than did the site investigators (13.6% versus 7.7% for placebo, 12.6% versus 6.2% for eptifibatide). The CEC and site investigator assessments of MI disagreed for 9% of all patients enrolled in the PURSUIT trial. The CEC identified MIs in 1415 of the 5005 patients with suspected MI. The site investigator and the CEC assessments disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients. Of these 983 patients with disagreements, 816 patients had a MI identified by the CEC but not the site investigator, and 167 patients had a MI identified by site investigator but not the CEC. The proportion of patients with disagreement was similar among regions. ## Reasons for disagreement Most often, when the site investigator had identified a MI and the CEC had not, the investigator had misclassified a MI at enrolment as an end-point MI, although by protocol these were not end-point events (Table [1](#)). Recurrent ischemic events without elevated cardiac enzymes or ECG evidence of MI were also incorrectly identified by site investigators as MIs (Table [1](#)). In cases where the CEC had identified a MI and the site investigators had not, one-third of those identified were MIs defined by enzyme elevations without clinical or ECG evidence of ischemia or infarction (Table [2](#)). Enzyme elevations after bypass surgery accounted for 25% of these cases. Patients with clinically evident ischemia reported by the site investigator and associated with cardiac enzyme elevations were not reported as MIs by investigators in 27% of the cases of disagreement (Table [2](#)). Few infarctions based on new Q waves without clinical evidence of reinfarction were identified by the CEC and not by site investigators. ::::table-wrap\n",

The absolute increase in mortality between 30 days and 6 months was greater in patients with CEC-determined MIs not identified by the site investigators than in patients with MI identified by the site investigators but not the CEC. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract # Background The safety of the immune complexes composed of yeast-derived hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies (abbreviated as YIC) among healthy adults and chronic hepatitis B patients has been proved in phase I and phase IIa trial. A larger number of patients for study of dosage and efficacy are therefore needed. ## Methods and Principal Findings Two hundred forty two HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients were immunized with six injections of either 30 µg YIC, 60 µg of YIC or alum adjuvant as placebo at four-week intervals under code. HBV markers and HBV DNA were monitored during immunization and 24 weeks after the completion of immunization. The primary endpoint was defined as loss of HBeAg, or presence of anti-HBe antibody or suppression of HBV DNA, while the secondary endpoint was both HBeAg seroconversion and suppression of HBV DNA. Statistical significance was not reached in primary endpoints four weeks after the end of treatment among three groups, however, at the end of follow-up, HBeAg sero-conversion rate was 21.8%(17/78) and 9% (7/78) in the 60 µg YIC and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.03), with 95% confidence intervals at 1.5% to 24.1%. Using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) model, a significant difference of group effects was found between 60 µg YIC and the placebo groups in terms of the primary endpoint. Eleven serious adverse events occurred, which were 5.1%, 3.6%, and 5.0% in the placebo, 30 µg YIC and 60 µg YIC groups respectively (p>0.05). ## Conclusions Though statistical differences in the preset primary and secondary endpoints among the three groups were not reached, a late and promising HBeAg seroconversion effect was shown in the 60 µg YIC immunized regimen. By increasing the number of patients and injections, the therapeutic efficacy of YIC in chronic hepatitis B patients will be further evaluated. ## Trial Registration ChiCTR.org [ChiCTR-TRC-00000022](#) # Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients Three hundred and fifty four hepatitis B patients were evaluated for the inclusion criteria. Of these, 242 patients were eligible and assigned randomly to placebo, 30 µg YIC and 60 µg YIC groups in a three-month period. Five patients were found ineligible during the batch assay at the end of treatment (week 24) at the central laboratory, and therefore were excluded from the intent-to-treat analysis. Of 237 patients included in the analysis , 8 receiving placebo, 5 receiving 30ug YIC, and 10 receiving 60ug YIC either did not complete the treatment, did not complete the follow-up or violated the protocol ( [Figure 1](#) ). No significant difference was found in baseline characteristics among three groups ( [Table 1](#) ). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0002565.g001 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Summary of participants.<br /> Footnote: The numbers of SAE patients are those who discontinued treatment, while other SAE patients are not included in this figure.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

In contrast, of the 6 patients immunized with alum, five patients had HBV DNA 10 ^5^ copies/ml, one had HBV DNA ≥10 ^6^ and <10 ^7^ copies/ml, none of them had HBV DNA ≥10 ^7^ copies/ml. # Reversion of HBeAg and rebound of HBV DNA The incidence of rebound in virus replication and reversion to serum HBeAg at the end of follow-up were compared among the three groups. For those responders who reached the secondary endpoint, none of the patients from either the 60 µg YIC group or placebo group showed a rebound in virus load nor in reversion to serum HBeAg. In contrast, four responders in the 30 µg YIC group showed a virus load rebound to the baseline level and HBeAg reverted to positive. Interestingly, rebound of viral load and reversion to serum HBeAg were all from responders who only reached the primary endpoint at the end of immunization, while none occurred in those who reached the secondary endpoint, suggesting that patients who achieved the secondary response at the endpoint of treatment were unlikely to develop reversion. # Adverse events and severe adverse events Overall, the most common systematic symptoms were similar for the three groups. However, more local reactions were found in the 60 µg YIC and 30 µg YIC groups. In the placebo group, the most common reaction was pain at the injection site, followed by malaise and fatigue; in the 30 µg and 60 µg YIC group, the most common adverse events were pain at the injection site, pruritus and swelling ( [Table 4](#) ). During study period, eleven patients experienced elevated ALT levels over ten times the normal level, accompanied by high levels of serum bilirubin and thus were hospitalized. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Heat stress potentially has detrimental effects on brain function. Hence, cognitive function may be impaired during physical activity in a hot environment. Skin cooling is often applied in a hot environment to counteract heat stress. However, it is unclear to what extent neck cooling is effective for cognitive impairment during exercise in a hot environment. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of temporal neck cooling on cognitive function during strenuous exercise in a hot environment. ## Methods Eight male young participants (mean ± SD, age = 26.1 ± 3.2 years; peak oxygen uptake = 45.6 ± 5.2 ml/kg/min) performed Spatial delayed response (DR) task (working memory) and Go/No-Go task (executive function) at rest and during exercise in the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions. After the participants completed the cognitive tasks at rest, they cycled the ergometer until their heart rate (HR) reached 160 beats/min. Then, they cycled for 10 min while keeping their HR at 160 beats/min. The cognitive tasks were performed 3 min after their HR reached 160 beats/min. The air temperature was maintained at 35°C and the relative humidity was controlled at 70%. Neck cooling was applied to the backside of the neck by a wet towel and fanning. We used accuracy of the Spatial DR and Go/No-Go tasks and reaction time in the Go/No-Go task to assess cognitive function. ## Results Neck cooling temporarily decreased the skin temperature during exercise. The accuracy of the cognitive tasks was lower during exercise than that at rest in the Hot and Hot + Cooling condition (p < 0.05). There were no differences in the accuracy between the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions (p = 0.98). Neither exercise (p = 0.40) nor cooling (p = 0.86) affected reaction time. These results indicate that temporal neck cooling did not alter cognitive function during strenuous exercise in a hot environment. ## Conclusions The present study suggests that temporal neck cooling with a wet towel and fanning is not effective for attenuating impairment of working memory and executive function during strenuous exercise with a short duration in a warm and humid environment. # Results and discussion ## Exercise intensity and HR Table [1](#) shows exercise intensity and HR after the participants reached a HR of 160 beats/min. We observed a significant main effect of Time Course (F [9,63] = 45.02, p < 0.001, η^2^ = 0.87) on exercise intensity. There were no significant main effect of Condition (F [1,7] = 1.62, p = 0.24, η^2^ = 0.19) and interaction (F [9,63] = 1.01, p = 0.44, η^2^ = 0.13). These results indicate that exercise intensity decreased as time elapsed and the degree of decrease was not different between conditions. Similarly, we found a significant main effect of Time Course (F [9,63] = 6.39, p < 0.001, η^2^ = 0.48) on HR. There were no significant main effect of Condition (F [1,7] = 2.91, p = 0.13, η^2^ = 0.29) and interaction (F [9,63] = 0.81, p = 0.61, η^2^ = 0.10). The significant main effect of Time Course may be ascribed to a slight higher HR around the first 3 min after the participants' HR reached 160 beats/min. Overall, HR appears to be well controlled around the target level in the present study. ::::table-wrap\n",

These results indicate that the accuracy of the cognitive task significantly decreased during exercise, and that temporal neck cooling had no effects on the accuracy of the cognitive task.

We tested if temporal neck cooling with a wet towel and fanning has beneficial effects on cognitive function during strenuous exercise with a short duration in a hot environment. The main finding of this study was that temporal neck cooling did not attenuate the detrimental effects on cognitive function during strenuous exercise in a hot environment. The present finding suggests that temporal neck cooling with a wet towel and fanning is not effective enough to attenuate cognitive impairment during strenuous exercise with a short duration in a warm and humid environment. We assessed cognitive function using the combination of spatial DR task and Go/No-Go task. The Spatial DR task requires working memory [[25](#), [29](#)]. The Go/No-Go task requires executive function, including selective attention, response inhibition and interference control [[30](#), [31](#)]. The prefrontal and parietal cortices play a key role in spatial working memory [[32](#)--[35](#)]. Activation in the prefrontal cortex is crucial for executive function [[36](#), [37](#)]. Furthermore, the frontopolar cortex, which is located at the most anterior part of the frontal cortex, is selectively activated in multi-tasking where execution of the primary task was maintained in a pending state while performing a secondary task [[38](#)]. Given that the present cognitive task was a modified version of multi-tasking, the present cognitive task required activation of the frontopolar cortex. Taken together, we can assume that the present cognitive task was appropriate to assess higher cognitive function in humans. In the present study, HR was maintained at 160 beats/min during exercise. Indeed, RPE was approximately 16 immediately after the cognitive tasks during exercise. Furthermore, blood lactate concentration increased above 5 mmol/l after exercise in both conditions. Hence, in the present study, we can assume that exercise intensity was classified as strenuous. Skin cooling may reduce thermal strain and/or discomfort at rest and during exercise [[5](#), [9](#)--[13](#)]. Thus, physiological as well as psychological changes induced by skin cooling may somehow attenuate the impairment in cognitive function during exercise in a hot environment. Previous studies indicated that head and neck cooling with frozen packs prevented the impairment of short-term memory [[14](#), [39](#)]. In the present study, the accuracy of the cognitive task decreased during exercise in the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions. We observed no differences in the accuracy of the cognitive task during exercise between conditions. These results suggest that temporal neck cooling for a short period did not have beneficial effects on cognitive function during exercise in a hot environment under the present condition. In the present study, while neck cooling temporarily decreased skin temperature, neck cooling did not alter body temperature. These results mean that the neck cooling applied in this study was not effective enough to decrease body temperature. The present results are in line with the findings showing that skin cooling did not reduce body temperature [[9](#)--[11](#), [40](#)]. Moreover, we found no differences in RPE between conditions. Therefore, the lack of beneficial effects of temporal neck cooling on cognitive function would be ascribed to that physiological and/or psychological changes induced by brief neck cooling was not sufficient enough to attenuate the detrimental effects on cognitive function. Dehydration is one of the potential factors that may impair cognitive function in a hot environment. Hence, we used strenuous exercise with a short duration. We expected that severe dehydration is unlikely to occur even in a hot environment in the present study. Indeed, weight reduction was less than 0.5% in the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions. Previous studies suggested that dehydration may impair complex cognitive tasks when weight reduction was greater than 2% [[21](#), [22](#), [39](#)]. Indeed, Gaoua et al. [[39](#)] suggested that, when weight reduction did not exceed 0.5%, fluid replacement is adequate and dehydration does not alter cognitive function. Hence, we can assume that the effects of dehydration on cognitive function were negligible in the present study. In contrast to the accuracy of the cognitive task, reaction time in the Go-trial was not altered by exercise. These results suggest that the effects of strenuous exercise in a hot environment are different between accuracy and speed of response. Previous studies indicated that nerve conduction velocity increases in the hot environment [[14](#), [39](#)]. Thus, exercise in a hot environment may increase in nerve conduction velocity, which leads to the decrease in reaction time. However, in the present study, it is unclear whether reaction time was not affected by strenuous exercise or whether increases in conduction velocity in a hot environment was not effective, possibly due to a short duration of exercise. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that increases in nerve conduction velocity compensated for the negative effects of strenuous exercise on speed of response. Provided that multiple factors are responsible for changes in response speed during exercise, further studies will be required to elucidate these points. It has been suggested that increase in arousal level induced by exercise affect cognitive function [[41](#), [42](#)]. From this viewpoint, the present results may suggest that arousal level went beyond the optimal level during strenuous exercise in a hot environment, and that temporal neck cooling was not effective to alter arousal level. However, physiological mechanisms underlying the alterations in arousal level during exercise remains to be elucidated. Thus, further studies are required to understand the association between arousal level and cognitive function.\n",
      "# Abstract ## BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity prevention during adolescence is a health priority. The 'Physical Activity 4 Everyone' (PA4E1) study tested a multi-component physical activity intervention in 10 secondary schools from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This paper aimed to report the secondary outcomes of the study; to determine whether the intervention impacted on adiposity outcomes (weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI *z*-score), and whether any effect was moderated by sex, baseline BMI and baseline physical activity level, at 12 and 24 months. ## SUBJECTS/METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. The school-based intervention included seven physical activity strategies targeting the following: curriculum (strategies to maximise physical activity in physical education, student physical activity plans, an enhanced school sport programme); school environment (physical activity during school breaks, modification of school policy); and parents and the community (parent engagement, links with community physical activity providers). Students' weight (kg), BMI and BMI *z*-score, were collected at baseline (Grade 7), 12 and 24 months. Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between-group mean difference from baseline to 12 and 24 months. Exploratory sub-analyses were undertaken according to three moderators of energy balance. ## RESULTS: A total of 1150 students (mean age=12 years) provided outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91%) at 12 months and 985 (86%) at 24 months. At 12 months, there were group-by-time effects for weight (mean difference=--0.90 kg (95% confidence interval (CI)=--1.50, −0.30), *P*<0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.50, −0.06), *P*=0.01) in favour of the intervention group, but not for BMI *z*-score (−0.05 (−0.11; 0.01), *P*=0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (−0.62 kg (−1.21, 0.03), *P*=0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.49, −0.06), *P*=0.01) at 24 months, with group-by-time effects also found for BMI *z*-score (−0.08 (−0.14; −0.02), *P*=0.02) favouring the intervention group. ## CONCLUSION: The PA4E1 school-based intervention achieved moderate reductions in adiposity among adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Multi-component interventions that increase adolescents' engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) may assist in preventing unhealthy weight gain. # Results ## Sample Of the 22 eligible schools, 13 were approached to participate in the study. Ten schools consented to participate (77%) and parental consent was obtained for 1233 of the 1468 Grade-7 students in the 10 schools (84%). A total of 1150 students provided adiposity outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91%) at mid-point (12 months) and 985 (86%) at 24 months. Demographic characteristics of the sample at baseline, 12 and 24 months are outlined in [Table 1](#). At baseline, the mean age of participants was 12 years, 51% were female, 17% were overweight and 5% were obese, and 64% did not meet the physical activity recommendation of ⩾60 min of MVPA per day. Participants who were lost to follow-up were more likely to be older in age (*P*=0.03) and did not speak English as a primary language (*P*=0.02) compared with those who provided outcome data at all time points. At 24 months, all 5 intervention schools had implemented 6 of the 7 physical activity strategies. The exception was strategy 5 (school policy); 4 of the 5 schools had developed a school policy. All intervention implementation strategies were delivered as planned. The majority of intervention group PE teachers (*n*=35) reported using pedometers to increase activity levels in PE (88.9%), and 58.8% reported including student physical activity plans each term. All schools were represented by at least one PE teacher (range 1--5) at each professional learning workshop. More information on intervention delivery can be found in the 24-month physical activity outcome paper.^[16](#)^ ## Indicators of adiposity The results for the 12- and 24-month adiposity outcomes are presented in [Table 2](#). At 12 months, there were group-by-time effects for weight (mean difference (95% CI) =−0.90 kg (−1.50; −0.30), *P*<0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.50; −0.06), *P*=0.01) in favour of the intervention group, but not for BMI *z*-score (−0.05 (−0.11; 0.01), *P*=0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (−0.62 kg (−1.21; −0.03), *P*=0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.49; −0.06), *P*=0.01) at 24 months, with group-by-time effects also found for BMI *z*-score (−0.08 (−0.14; −0.02), *P*=0.02) favouring the intervention group. Intervention effects were significant for all adiposity outcomes at 12 and 24 months in both the complete cases and multiple imputation analyses ([Supplementary Appendix 1 and 2](#)). ## Subgroup analyses The results of the subgroup analyses are presented in [Supplementary Appendix 3](#). ### Sex There was weak evidence of a differential treatment on effect on weight in males compared with females (three-way interaction *P*=0.22). Among males there was a statistically significant treatment effect at 24 months in favour of the intervention group (−1.26 kg (−2.11; −0.41), *P*=0.01). There were no significant effects on weight, BMI and BMI *z*-score at either 12 or 24 months for females. ### Weight status at baseline We found very little evidence of differential treatment effects depending on baseline weight for weight (*P*=0.50), BMI (*P*=0.57) or BMI *z*-score (*P*=0.64). Nevertheless, we did observe the following results. Among underweight and normal weight participants combined, there were significant effects for weight (−0.71 kg (−1.28; −0.14), *P*=0.04), BMI (−0.33 kg m^−2^ (−0.55; −0.10), *P*=0.01) and BMI *z*-score (−0.08 (−0.15; −0.01), *P*=0.01) in favour of the intervention group at 12-month follow-up. Similar findings for weight (−0.71 kg (−1.28; −0.14), *P*=0.04), BMI (−0.33 kg m^−2^ (−0.55; −0.10), *P*=0.01) and BMI *z*-score (−0.08 (−0.15; −0.01), *P*=0.01) in underweight/normal weight participants were found at 24 months in favour of the intervention group. Among overweight and obese students, no significant effects were found at 12 or 24 months for weight (12 months=−1.29 kg (−3.12; 0.53), *P*=0.16; 24 months=−1.16 kg (−2.98; 0.67), *P*=0.30), BMI (12 months=−0.39 kg m^−2^ (−1.01; 0.22), *P*=0.21; 24 months=−0.18 kg m^−2^ (−0.80; 0.44), *P*=0.45) and BMI *z*-score (12 months=−0.07 (−0.21; 0.07), *P*=0.31; 24 months=−0.00 (−0.14; 0.14), *P*=0.54). ### Physical activity level at baseline We found no evidence of differential treatment effects depending on activity status at baseline for weight (*P*=0.94), BMI (*P*=0.95) or BMI *z*-score (*P*=0.31).There was no significant effect on weight, BMI or BMI *z*-score for either active or inactive students at 12 or 24 months. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Self-management programs for patients with heart failure can reduce hospitalizations and mortality. However, no programs have analyzed their usefulness for patients with low literacy. We compared the efficacy of a heart failure self-management program designed for patients with low literacy versus usual care. ## Methods We performed a 12-month randomized controlled trial. From November 2001 to April 2003, we enrolled participants aged 30--80, who had heart failure and took furosemide. Intervention patients received education on self-care emphasizing daily weight measurement, diuretic dose self-adjustment, and symptom recognition and response. Picture-based educational materials, a digital scale, and scheduled telephone follow-up were provided to reinforce adherence. Control patients received a generic heart failure brochure and usual care. Primary outcomes were combined hospitalization or death, and heart failure-related quality of life. ## Results 123 patients (64 control, 59 intervention) participated; 41% had inadequate literacy. Patients in the intervention group had a lower rate of hospitalization or death (crude incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.69; CI 0.4, 1.2; adjusted IRR = 0.53; CI 0.32, 0.89). This difference was larger for patients with low literacy (IRR = 0.39; CI 0.16, 0.91) than for higher literacy (IRR = 0.56; CI 0.3, 1.04), but the interaction was not statistically significant. At 12 months, more patients in the intervention group reported monitoring weights daily (79% vs. 29%, p < 0.0001). After adjusting for baseline demographic and treatment differences, we found no difference in heart failure-related quality of life at 12 months (difference = -2; CI -5, +9). ## Conclusion A primary care-based heart failure self-management program designed for patients with low literacy reduces the risk of hospitalizations or death. # Results ## Patients We screened 919 patients on furosemide between November 2001 and April 2003. 127 met eligibility criteria and agreed to participate (Figure [2](#)). Of those not enrolled, 407 did not have heart failure according to their physician, 367 did not meet eligibility criteria and 27 declined to participate. Of those randomized to the control group, 1 never returned after the first visit, 1 withdrew during the study and 4 died during the study. Follow-up was completed for all of the remaining participants (98%) (Figure [3](#)). Of those randomized to the intervention group, 3 never returned after the first visit, 4 withdrew during the study and 3 died during the study. Follow-up was completed for all of the remaining participants (93%). At baseline, most characteristics were similar between the two groups (Table [1](#)). However, the control group had more participants with hypertension, fewer with diabetes, and fewer men. Of heart failure related characteristics, the control group had more participants with systolic dysfunction, and taking β-blockers. The intervention group had more participants taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and digoxin. Regardless of these differences, none were statistically significant. The control group did have statistically significantly higher baseline MLHF scores representing worse symptoms at baseline. ## Hospitalization or death There were 68 hospitalizations (65) or deaths (3) in the intervention group and 111 (107 hospitalizations, 4 deaths) in the control group. The crude all-cause hospital admission or death incidence rate ratio (IRR) was 0.69 (95% CI 0.40, 1.19). After adjusting for age, gender, use of ACE inhibitor or ARB, use of a β-blocker, presence of hypertension, and baseline MLHF, intervention patients were less likely to have the outcome (IRR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32, 0.89). 61% of patients in the control group had at least one hospitalization or died, and 42% of patients in the intervention group had at least 1 hospitalization or died (p = 0.13). ## Cardiac hospitalization 39% of patients in the control group and 34% of patients in the intervention group had at least one hospitalization for cardiac causes (p = 0.55). The unadjusted IRR was 0.79 (95% CI 0.42, 1.5). After adjusting for baseline differences, the IRR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.44, 1.7). ## Heart failure-related quality of life In unadjusted analysis, the control group, on average, improved 5 points on the MLHF and the intervention group improved by 1 point. The difference was not statistically significant (3.5 points, 95% CI 11, -4, p = 0.36). After adjusting for baseline differences between the groups, the difference was 2 points (95% CI 9, -5, p = 0.59) suggesting no effect on heart failure-related quality of life. ## Other outcomes ### Knowledge Heart failure related knowledge improved more in the intervention group than in the control group. Mean difference in score improvement was 12 percentage points (95% CI 6, 18; p < 0.001). ### Self-efficacy Heart failure self-efficacy improved more in the intervention group than in the control group. Mean difference in score improvement was 2 points (95% CI 0.7, 3.1; p = 0.0026). ### Self-care behavior Significantly more patients in the intervention group than in the control group reported daily weight measurement at 12 months (79% vs. 29%, p < 0.001). ## Subgroup analyses according to literacy Twenty-four patients in each group had inadequate literacy based on the S-TOFHLA (Table [2](#)). Among these patients, there was no difference in quality of life score in unadjusted and adjusted analyses (difference = -1.6; 95% CI -15, 12); p = 0.81). For the combined outcome of hospitalization or death, the unadjusted IRR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.30, 1.94). After adjusting for baseline differences, the IRR was 0.39 (95% CI 0.16, 0.91). Seventy-five patients had marginal or adequate literacy based on the S-TOFHLA. We found no difference in quality of life score in unadjusted and adjusted analyses (difference = -4.2; 95% CI -14, 6; p = 0.40). Among patients in the higher literacy group, the unadjusted IRR for hospitalization or death was 0.65 (95% CI 0.33, 1.3). After adjusting for baseline differences, the IRR was 0.56 (95% CI 0.30, 1.04). We did not find a statistically significant effect modification between literacy and the intervention. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract Artemisinin combination therapies are available in private outlets, but patient adherence might be compromised by poor advice from dispensers. In this cluster randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Eligible patients purchasing AL at shops in both arms were followed up at home and questioned about each dose taken. Dispensers were interviewed regarding knowledge of AL dispensing practices and receipt of the malaria-related text messages. We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, *p* [adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, *p* [adjusted] = 0.9). Further studies on the potential of text messages to improve adherence are needed. # Results [Figure 1](#) shows the trial profile. Of the 82 randomized ADDOs, 37 from the control arm and 40 from the intervention arm participated in the study. The number of registered patients eligible for follow-up was 537 in the control arm and 518 in the intervention arm, with ∼15% of patients in each arm lost to follow-up. Most outlets were in urban wards (70% in both arms), had a single dispenser, and had at least some ACTs in stock on the day of interview ([Table 1](#)). Of 51 dispensers in the control arm and 59 in the intervention arm, ∼80% in both arms were female and had a low-level medical qualification, mostly nurse assistants ([Table 2](#)). Though low in both arms, more ADDOs in the control arm compared with the intervention arm were able to show an accreditation certificate (43% versus 20%, respectively). However, the difference in the percentages of dispensers that had received training on ACTs was not as pronounced (69% in the control arm versus 60% in the intervention arm), though the median year of training was more recent in the control arm (2011 versus 2009). Characteristics of patients were well balanced between arms ([Table 3](#)). A high percentage of patients (36% in the control arm and 38% in the intervention arm) had sought care before attending the study ADDO, with most patients going to a kiosk or general shop and only 7% of patients in the control arm and 4% in the intervention arm going to a public health facility. Approximately 90% reported symptoms of fever or headache, and approximately half had upset stomachs or nausea. Based on an mRDT taken at the time of follow-up, 28% in the control arm and 25% in the intervention arm tested positive, with only 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively, testing positive by study blood smear. (Some degree of discrepancy is expected because of the persistence of HRP2 detected by the mRDT.) Seventy percent of dispensers received at least 75% of the text messages. The median percentage of messages received was 86%, with 20% of dispensers receiving no messages ([Figure 3](#)). [Table 4](#) presents results of the dispenser interviews on knowledge of advice to provide patients when dispensing AL. Dispensers in the intervention arm reported slightly better knowledge of the correct AL regimen for adults in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (90% versus 78%; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95, 1.5); *p* [adjusted] = 0.0748), though knowledge of the correct regimen for a child aged four weighing 20 kg was lower than for adults in both arms (75% versus 64%; aPR = 1.2 [0.85, 1.7]; *p* [adjusted] = 0.2). Dispenser knowledge was considerably higher in the intervention arm than the control arm on advice to take AL with fatty food (60% versus 20%; aPR = 3.4 [95% CI: 1.6, 7.1]; *p* [adjusted] < 0.0001) and to continue to take AL if minor side effects occur (68% versus 43%; aPR = 1.6 [95% CI: 1.0, 2.4]; *p* [adjusted] = 0.0188). However, surprisingly high dispenser knowledge (87--99%) was recorded in both arms on advice to complete treatment even if feeling better, advice to return to the ADDO or go to a health facility if the condition worsens, and advice to take the second dose after 8 hours ([Table 4](#)). Knowledge on advising patients to take a replacement dose in case of vomiting within half an hour of taking a dose was lower (55% versus 50%), with no difference observed between arms. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Percentage of text messages received by dispensers in the intervention arm.</figcaption> </figure> [Table 5](#) shows that ∼60% of patients in both arms reported being told how to take AL correctly, with similar percentages reporting being told to take the second dose after 8 hours and to complete treatment even if feeling better, indicating that dispensers were providing some advice even in the absence of the intervention. However, no differences were found between control and intervention arms for any piece of advice. Less than 5% of patients in both arms reported being told about vomiting, side effects, or taking AL with fatty food, and < 10% in both arms took the first dose of AL at the ADDO. There was no difference in patient adherence between arms ([Table 6](#)). Completed treatment was 70% in the control arm and 68% in the intervention arm (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 0.96 [95% CI: 0.82, 1.1]; *p* [adjusted] = 0.6), with a similar percentage of patients adherent to each of the four age-appropriate blister packs and no important differences between arms. The mean number of doses taken by non-adherent patients was four in both arms, and the most common reported reasons for non-adherence included planning to take the medication later, forgetting to take the tablets, feeling better, and other reasons ([Figure 4](#)). Timely completion was much lower, with 33% of patients in both arms taking all doses at appropriate times. A per protocol analysis, excluding patients attending ADDOs where at least one dispenser did not receive any messages, had no impact on results. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Reasons given by patients/caretakers for not completing treatment.</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Purpose Increased awareness of the importance of dietary fibre has led to increased interest in \"functional\" fibre components like digestion-resistant maltodextrin (RMD). This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study assessed the effects of RMD in the colonic transit time (CTT) and defecation characteristics (frequency, stool volume and consistency). ## Methods Sixty-six healthy adult volunteers (32 men) who did not have a daily defecation habit had a 7-day run-in period before the 21-day intervention period with RMD or placebo. CTT and segmental CTT (SCTT) were assessed by a single abdominal X-ray film taken at the end of both periods after radiopaque marker ingestion. Defecation characteristics and intestinal functions were also assessed, which were self-reported by patients. Intragroup comparisons were evaluated by Student's paired *t* test, Bonferroni test and Chi-square test, while time comparisons by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and time-by-treatment interaction by repeated-measures ANOVA. ## Results Fifty-seven subjects were assessed for CTT (placebo, *n* = 28; RMD, *n* = 29). In the RMD group, the total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT decreased significantly compared to baseline (*p* < 0.01 each; −13.3, −4.7, −8.7 h, respectively). Significant differences between groups were observed in total CTT and left SCTT. Significant time-by-treatment interaction was observed in the RMD group for stool volume (*p* = 0.014), increasing 56 % compared to baseline (*p* < 0.01), while remained unchanged in the placebo group. Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (*p* < 0.01). No adverse effects related to study products were observed. ## Conclusions The results show that RMD improved CTT, stool volume, stool consistency and some intestinal functions in a healthy population. # Results ## Baseline data A total of 73 candidates were assessed for eligibility, and 67 subjects met the criteria and were randomly allocated into two groups. One subject was withdrawn during the run-in period before receiving intervention (Fig. [1](#)). Thus, a total of 66 subjects were analysed, 33 in each study group. The demographic and other baseline characteristics of subjects in each group are outlined in Table [1](#). Briefly, the population was 51.5 % female with the mean age of 21.3 years and the mean BMI 23.0 kg/m^2^. The two study groups were well balanced with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics, and no significant difference was found in any of the variables between groups. The mean daily fibre intake was 10.0 ± 4.6 g in the RMD group and 11.5 ± 4.6 g in the placebo group. Overall, no significant differences in the diet were observed between groups. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Disposition of subjects for placebo (maltodextrin) and digestion-resistant maltodextrin (RMD) groups</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## OBJECTIVE Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes but less so in children. We designed a study to assess CGM benefit in young children aged 4 to 9 years with type 1 diabetes. ## RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS After a run-in phase, 146 children with type 1 diabetes (mean age 7.5 ± 1.7 years, 64% on pumps, median diabetes duration 3.5 years) were randomly assigned to CGM or to usual care. The primary outcome was reduction in HbA~1c~ at 26 weeks by ≥0.5% without the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia. ## RESULTS The primary outcome was achieved by 19% in the CGM group and 28% in the control group (*P* = 0.17). Mean change in HbA~1c~ was −0.1% in each group (*P* = 0.79). Severe hypoglycemia rates were similarly low in both groups. CGM wear decreased over time, with only 41% averaging at least 6 days/week at 26 weeks. There was no correlation between CGM use and change in HbA~1c~ (*r~s~* = −0.09, *P* = 0.44). CGM wear was well tolerated, and parental satisfaction with CGM was high. However, parental fear of hypoglycemia was not reduced. ## CONCLUSIONS CGM in 4- to 9-year-olds did not improve glycemic control despite a high degree of parental satisfaction with CGM. We postulate that this finding may be related in part to limited use of the CGM glucose data in day-to-day management and to an unremitting fear of hypoglycemia. Overcoming the barriers that prevent integration of these critical glucose data into day-to-day management remains a challenge. # RESULTS Between January 2009 and December 2010, the trial randomized 146 children aged 4.0--9.9 years (7.5 ± 1.7 years [mean ± SD]) who had a median duration of type 1 diabetes of 3.5 years (interquartile range 2.2--5.2). The majority of participants was non-Hispanic white and was using insulin pumps. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups ([Table 1](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "![]():::: HbA~1c~ decreased by a mean of 0.2 ± 0.7% (measured with a DCA instrument) during the run-in phase. Mean HbA~1c~ at the time of randomization (measured by central laboratory) was 7.9 ± 0.8% in each treatment group. Total daily insulin dose averaged 0.8 ± 0.2 units/kg/day in both treatment groups at baseline and at 26 weeks. The 26-week primary outcome visit was completed by 69 of 74 participants (93%) in the CGM group and 68 of 72 (94%) in the control group, with 5 and 4 participants in the two treatment groups, respectively, discontinuing study participation prior to completion of the 26-week visit ([Supplementary Fig. A1](#)). The overall completion rates for the six follow-up visits and the six protocol-specified phone calls were 93% and 94% in the CGM and control groups, respectively. Among the 74 participants in the CGM group, 10 (14%) were provided with a Paradigm CGM device and 64 (86%) with a Navigator CGM device. No participants in the control group self-initiated CGM prior to completing the 26-week visit. ## Glycemic control The primary outcome of a decrease from randomization to 26 weeks in HbA~1c~ ≥0.5% with no severe hypoglycemic events occurred in 13 of 69 (19%) participants in the CGM group and 19 of 68 (28%) in the control group (*P* = 0.17). Mean change in HbA~1c~ was similar between groups (−0.1 ± 0.6 in each group, *P* = 0.79) ([Supplementary Fig. A2](#)). Other HbA~1c~ outcomes at 26 weeks showed similar comparability between treatment groups ([Table 2](#)).

      "![]():::: Glycemic outcomes measured with CGM showed no significant differences between treatment groups (considering the multiple outcomes assessed) with respect to percent of values within, above, and below the target range ([Table 2](#) and [Supplementary Table A2](#)). Participants in both groups had glucose values >250 mg/dL for >20% of the day. ## Hypoglycemia and other adverse events Three participants (4%, three total events) in the CGM group and five participants (7%, six total events) in the control group experienced at least one severe hypoglycemic event, with no significant differences comparing treatment groups (incidence rate = 8.6 and 17.6 per 100 person-years, respectively; *P* = 0.80) ([Table 2](#)). At 26 weeks, both groups had CGM glucose values ≤60 mg/dL for <1% of the day. There were no cases of diabetic ketoacidosis and no serious adverse events attributable to the study interventions, including no serious skin reactions. ## Frequency of sensor use in the CGM group A total of 63 (91%) of 69 participants who completed the 26-week visit were wearing a sensor on at least 1 day a week at the end of 26 weeks. The amount of CGM sensor wear decreased during the 26 weeks of the study (*P* < 0.001) ([Fig. 1](#)), with only 41% averaging at least 6 days/week of wear in month 6. The amount of sensor wear in month 6 did not vary with age overall (*r* = −0.07) and was not associated with baseline HbA~1c~ (*r* = −0.02). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Sensor use during the 26 weeks of the trial.

For participants who dropped from the trial, sensor use was considered to be zero after the day of dropout. Data were considered missing when downloaded glucose data were not available for a 4-week period. *Sensor download was unavailable due to device issue for one subject in 22–26 weeks.</figcaption> </figure> There was no association between change in HbA~1c~ from baseline to 26 weeks and the overall amount of CGM sensor wear during the entire 26 weeks (Spearman *r~s~* = −0.09, *P* = 0.44) or during month 6 (Spearman *r~s~* = −0.11, *P* = 0.37). However, the 28 participants who wore a sensor ≥6 days/week during month 6 tended to have a slightly greater reduction in HbA~1c~ compared with the 41 participants who wore a sensor less frequently (mean change from baseline to 26 weeks −0.3 ± 0.7% vs. 0.0 ± 0.5%, *P* = 0.01; 25 vs. 15% with a reduction in HbA~1c~ ≥0.5% without a severe hypoglycemia event, *P* = 0.33). Among those wearing a sensor ≥6 days/week in month 6, the median percentage of glucose values in the target range of 71--180 mg/dL was 51%, with 38% >200 mg/dL, 16% >250 mg/dL, and 0.3% ≤60 mg/dL compared with 43, 44, 23, and 0.4%, respectively, in those wearing a sensor less frequently. ## Quality of life assessments At 26 weeks, there were no significant differences between treatment groups on the Hypoglycemia Fear or the PAID questionnaire survey scores ([Table 2](#) and [Supplementary Tables A3 and A6](#)). However, scores on the Blood Glucose Monitoring System Rating Scale were indicative of fewer problems/concerns perceived by the CGM group compared with the control group ([Table 2](#) and [Supplementary Table A5](#)). On the CGM Satisfaction Scale at 26 weeks ([Table 3](#) and [Supplementary Table A4](#)), parents generally reported a high degree of satisfaction with CGM, with an average item score of 3.9 and 86% of scores ≥3.5 (on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with 3 being neutral). Mean item scores were more favorable than neutral (>3.0) on all 43 items. Scores on the Benefits of CGM subscale tended to be slightly higher than scores on the Lack of Hassles of CGM subscale (mean 4.1 ± 0.4 vs. 3.9 ± 0.6, respectively). It is particularly noteworthy that >90% of parents responded that use of CGM makes adjusting insulin easier, shows patterns in blood glucose not seen before, and makes them feel safer knowing that they will be warned about low blood glucose before it happens. No one responded that he or she would not recommend CGM for other children with type 1 diabetes. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Physical activity (PA) prevents chronic diseases. Self-determination theory (SDT) provides a useful framework to understand the nature of motivational interviewing (MI). ## Objective This study aimed to determine the effect of MI-based intervention using SDT on the promotion of PA among women in reproductive age. ## Methods Seventy women in reproductive age were selected by clustering sampling method for this randomized controlled trial. The questionnaire included the variables of physical fitness test, SDT, and global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ). The validity of the questionnaires was approved using content validity ratio (CVR) and index (CVI). The reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaires and measures was approved using test-retest method and Cronbach's alpha test, respectively. The intervention group (n=35) received four MI sessions through theory and one standard education session about PA. The control group (n=35) received a standard education session about PA. ## Results Four months after the intervention, an increase in the mean scores of total PA (p<0.001, ES=4.77), physical fitness tests including flexibility (p<0.001, ES=1.59), muscular endurance (p<0.001, ES=2.0), cardiorespiratory endurance (p<0.001, ES=0.51), and a decrease in mean scores of agility test (p<0.001, ES= − 0.51) and sedentary behavior (p<0.01, ES=− 0.74) was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of intrinsic motivation (p<0.001, ES=3.34), identified regulation (p<0.001, ES= 1.28), perceptions of competence (p<0.001, ES=0.81) and autonomy (p<0.001, ES=2.01), enjoyment (p<0.001, ES=0.98) and health motives (p<0.01, ES=0.19), health care climate (p<0.001, ES=4.6), and a decreased score of external regulation (p<0.01, ES=−0.55) and amotivation (p<0.01, ES= −0.56) over time, compared to the control group. ## Conclusion MI-based intervention using SDT was effective on the promotion of PA. ## Trial registration The Trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial ([http://www.irct.ir](#)) with the Irct ID: IRCT2015101924592N1. # 3. Results Seventy women in reproductive age were randomly assigned to the randomized controlled trial. With Chi-squared test, no significant difference was observed between intervention and control groups regarding the demographic characteristics (age, educational level, job, spouse's job) and body composition (p>0.05). ## 3.1. SDT components The results of the psychological variables of SDT are shown in [Table 2](#). With repeated measures test, the intervention group showed a higher level of autonomy, identified regulation, perception of competence, challenge and enjoyment motives through time than before the intervention. Friedman's non-parametric test also showed an increased intrinsic motivation, introjected regulation, perception of self-determination and fitness/health motive and a reduction in amotivation in the intervention group compared to before intervention over time ([Table 2](#)). Comparing the intervention and control groups within 4 months, variables such as intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, perception of autonomy, perception of competence and perception of relatedness, enjoyment motive, and health care climate, indicated moderate to high effect sizes. Conversely, introjected regulation, external regulation, amotivation and fitness/health, challenge, social and appearance motives, showed low or negative effect sizes ([Table 3](#)). ## 3.2. Physical activity and sedentary behavior With repeated measures tests, the participants in the intervention group showed a higher level of PA over time and a lower level of sedentary behavior in the non-parametric Friedman test compared to pre-intervention time ([Table 2](#)). Within 4 months after intervention, the subjects in the intervention group showed higher level of PA with high effect size and lower level of sedentary behavior with negative effect size compared with the control group. ## 3.3. Body composition and physical fitness tests In the intervention group, the repeated measures tests showed a significant reduction in body mass index, and paired t-test showed a significant increase in body flexibility, muscle endurance, and cardiorespiratory endurance and a significant reduction in agility score over time ([Table 2](#)). The subjects in the intervention group indicated lower scores of body mass index and agility, with a negative effect size and higher levels of cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular endurance and flexibility of the body with medium to high effect sizes, in 4 months after intervention compared with the control group ([Table 4](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, as a consequence of preterm birth, is a major cause of early mortality and morbidity. The withdrawal of progesterone, either actual or functional, is thought to be an antecedent to the onset of labour. There remains limited information on clinically relevant health outcomes as to whether vaginal progesterone may be of benefit for pregnant women with a history of a previous preterm birth, who are at high risk of a recurrence. Our primary aim was to assess whether the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries in women with a history of previous spontaneous preterm birth reduced the risk and severity of respiratory distress syndrome in their infants, with secondary aims of examining the effects on other neonatal morbidities and maternal health and assessing the adverse effects of treatment. ## Methods Women with a live singleton or twin pregnancy between 18 to <24 weeks' gestation and a history of prior preterm birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation in the preceding pregnancy, where labour occurred spontaneously or in association with cervical incompetence or following preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, were eligible. Women were recruited from 39 Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian maternity hospitals and assigned by randomisation to vaginal progesterone pessaries (equivalent to 100 mg vaginal progesterone) (*n* = 398) or placebo (*n* = 389). Participants and investigators were masked to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was respiratory distress syndrome and severity. Secondary outcomes were other respiratory morbidities; other adverse neonatal outcomes; adverse outcomes for the woman, especially related to preterm birth; and side effects of progesterone treatment. Data were analysed for all the 787 women (100%) randomised and their 799 infants. ## Findings Most women used their allocated study treatment (740 women, 94.0%), with median use similar for both study groups (51.0 days, interquartile range [IQR] 28.0--69.0, in the progesterone group versus 52.0 days, IQR 27.0--76.0, in the placebo group). The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was similar in both study groups---10.5% (42/402) in the progesterone group and 10.6% (41/388) in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64--1.49, *p* = 0.912)---as was the severity of any neonatal respiratory disease (adjusted treatment effect 1.02, 95% CI 0.69--1.53, *p* = 0.905). No differences were seen between study groups for other respiratory morbidities and adverse infant outcomes, including serious infant composite outcome (155/406 [38.2%] in the progesterone group and 152/393 [38.7%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82--1.17, *p* = 0.798). The proportion of infants born before 37 weeks' gestation was similar in both study groups (148/406 [36.5%] in the progesterone group and 146/393 [37.2%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81--1.17, *p* = 0.765). A similar proportion of women in both study groups had maternal morbidities, especially those related to preterm birth, or experienced side effects of treatment. In 9.9% (39/394) of the women in the progesterone group and 7.3% (28/382) of the women in the placebo group, treatment was stopped because of side effects (adjusted RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.85--2.15, *p* = 0.204). The main limitation of the study was that almost 9% of the women did not start the medication or forgot to use it 3 or more times a week. ## Conclusions Our results do not support the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries in women with a history of a previous spontaneous preterm birth to reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or other neonatal and maternal morbidities related to preterm birth. Individual participant data meta-analysis of the relevant trials may identify specific women for whom vaginal progesterone might be of benefit. ## Trial registration Current Clinical Trials [ISRCTN20269066](#). # Results ## Baseline information Of an estimated 1,919 eligible women able to be approached by the research team between February 2006 and September 2012, a total of 787 (41%) women consented to be enrolled in the study. Reasons for eligible women declining to participate included 'not interested in research' (25%), 'concerned about side effects and risks of use of drugs in pregnancy' (15%), 'no reason given' (13%), 'did not like the need to use vaginal pessaries' (9%), 'too busy' (8%), 'did not consider themselves to be at risk of preterm birth' (6%), 'partner declined to let them participate' (5), and 'other' (19%). Of the 787 women recruited, 398 (50.6%) were randomised to the progesterone group, and 389 (49.4%) to the placebo group. There were no losses to follow-up, with clinical outcomes to primary hospital discharge after birth available for all 787 (100%) women and their 799 infants ([Fig 1](#)). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002390.g001 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram of participants in the study.</figcaption> </figure> The 2 study groups were similar at the time of study entry for maternal demographics and key variables including gestational age, the reason for the preterm birth in the preceding pregnancy, and the gestational age at which that birth occurred ([Table 1](#)). The majority of participants had a singleton pregnancy, with less than 2% having a twin pregnancy ([Table 1](#)). Almost all women recruited in both study groups used their allocated study treatment (381 [95.7%] in the progesterone group and 359 [92.3%] in the placebo group), with similar median days of use in both study groups (51.0 days [interquartile range (IQR) 28.0--69.0] in the progesterone group versus 52.0 days [IQR 27.0--76.0] in the placebo group) ([Table 1](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

There were 12 (1.5%) infant deaths before hospital discharge: 4 stillbirths and 1 death of a live-born infant in the progesterone group and 5 stillbirths and 2 deaths of live-born infants in the placebo group---not a significant difference ([Table 2](#)). The proportion of infants born before 37 weeks' gestation was similar in both study groups (148/406 [36.5%] in the progesterone group and 146/393 [37.2%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81--1.17, *p* = 0.765). A similar proportion of infants were born by caesarean section in both study groups. No differences were evident between the study groups for any of the other individual adverse infant outcomes that included low Apgar score, small for gestational age at birth, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leucomalacia, patent ductus arteriosus requiring treatment, necrotising enterocolitis, proven early neonatal sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, and need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and duration of the infant's postnatal stay ([Table 2](#)). ## Secondary outcomes for the women ### Significant health outcomes There were no differences between study groups in the proportion of women experiencing 1 or more significant health outcomes overall (180/398 [45.2%] in the progesterone group and 174/389 [44.7%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86--1.17, *p* = 0.994) or in the individual health outcomes, particularly those related to preterm birth, including use of tocolytic therapy and antenatal corticosteroids prior to the birth, antepartum haemorrhage, preeclampsia, risk of rupture of the membranes preterm or at or near term, chorioamnionitis requiring antibiotics, and postpartum haemorrhage ([Table 3](#)). There were no maternal deaths. Antibiotic use after birth was similar between the study groups, as was the need for antenatal admission and the length of any antenatal or postnatal hospital stay ([Table 3](#)). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background: Hernia is an abnormal protrusion of an organ or tissue through a defect in its surrounding walls which most commonly involves the abdominal wall, particularly the inguinal region. The treatment options for hernia ranges from simple exercises to modern surgeries. The effect of yoga therapy is not scientifically examined for reversible inguinal hernia and hence this study is undertaken with the aim to test the effect of selected asanas in reversible inguinal hernia. ## Materials and Methods: A quasi experimental trail of 19 males through consecutive sampling was done with selected asanas for three months and the outcome was measured by a questionnaire focusing on pain, aggravating factors, relieving factors and frequency of occurrence of symptoms of hernia. ## Results: The pre and post interventional data were compared statistically and found significant reduction of symptoms with *P*≤0.001 in pain, frequency of occurrence and aggravating factors. The relieving factors showed significant increase with *P*≤0.001. ## Conclusion: Yoga therapy with selected asanas is effective in the treatment of reversible inguinal hernia. # Data analysis and results The pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments were carried out by using the hernia questionnaire designed for this study. This includes the details about intensity of pain, relieving factors, aggravating factors and frequency of occurrence in last two weeks which were used for analysis along with the general information. Schedule method of data collection was used. Data analysis including descriptive analysis and inferential analysis were done by using computerized software (SPSS-11.5) Statistical package for social sciences, Version 11.5 for windows. # Descriptive statistics Descriptive statistics includes measures of central tendency specifically the median and measures of dispersion namely minimum, maximum, first quartile, third quartile and quartile deviation for all the studied dependent variables before and after intervention. # Inferential statistics Inferential statistics of significance testing was done by using Wilcoxon signed-rank test with asymptomatic two tailed z test for paired observations i.e. before and after intervention for all studied variables. # General information Nineteen subjects participated in the study. General information like age, side of bulge, first occurrence of symptoms, activity during first occurrence and effect of rest were also recorded for all participants as applicable. # Age group Age of the subjects ranged from 24 to 46 years, with the mean of 36.26 years and standard deviation of 7.43 years. # Side involved Out of nineteen subjects studied, ten presented with left side hernia, eight with right side hernia and remaining one presented with hernia on both sides. # First occurrence of the problem Out of nineteen studied, eleven subjects were not able to retrieve any detail about first occurrence of the problem. For six subjects, the problem occurred during activity and taking rest relieved it. Remaining two was not clear about the exact activity during occurrence, but they gave the approximate duration of their problem. For all the subjects, there was no history of previous hernia. # Pain Intensity of pain was measured with numeric pain rating scale starting from zero to ten where zero indicates no pain and ten indicates maximum tolerable pain, which was a part of the hernia questionnaire. Pain intensity before intervention ranged from three to eight with median of six and quartile deviation of one. Pain intensity after intervention was from zero to three with median of one and quartile deviation of one [[Table 1](#), [Figure 1](#)]. The z value of Wilcoxon signed-rank test which is equal to --3.864 with *P* value<0.001 denotes that there is statistically significant reduction in pain after intervention. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background/Aims First-line therapies against *Helicobacter pylori*, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) plus two antibiotics, may fail in up to 20% of patients. 'Rescue' therapy is usually needed for patients who failed the first-line treatment. This study evaluated the eradication rate of bismuth-containing quadruple rescue therapy over a 1- or 2-week period. ## Methods We prospectively investigated 169 patients with a persistent *H. pylori* infection after the first-line triple therapy, which was administered from October 2008 to March 2010. The patients were randomized to receive a 1- or 2-week quadruple rescue therapy (pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d., tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg q.i.d., metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d.). After the 'rescue' therapy, the eradication rate, compliance, and adverse events were evaluated. ## Results The 1-week group achieved 83.5% (71/85) and 87.7% (71/81) eradication rates in the intention to treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses, respectively. The 2-week group obtained 87.7% (72/84) and 88.9% (72/81) eradication rate in the ITT and PP analyses, respectively. There was no significant difference in the eradication rate, patient compliance or rate of adverse events between the two groups. ## Conclusions One-week bismuth-containing quadruple therapy can be as effective as a 2-week therapy after the failure of the first-line eradication therapy. # RESULTS All randomized 169 patients were eligible for ITT analysis. Among these patients, 85 patients received 1-week PPI+BMT and 84 patients received 2-week PPI+BMT. The main demographic and clinical features of 169 patients according to the two treatment arms are shown in [Table 1](#). Demographic characteristics were similar, except for higher proportion of patients with duodenal ulcers in the 2-week PPI+BMT group, as were symptoms at the initial assessment. Overall, seven patients had protocol violations that excluded them from PP analysis. Among these patients, four patients were in the 1-week PPI+BMT treatment group. Their violations were follow-up loss, inadequately taking medicine and discontinuing the therapy due to intolerable side effects. Thus, seven patients were dropped out from PP analysis. [Fig. 1](#) shows the flow diagram of patients progress through the phases of the study. The 1-week PPI+BMT regimen achieved 83.5% (95% CI, 76% to 91%) eradication rate in ITT analysis and 87.7% (95% CI, 80% to 95%) in PP analysis, while the 2-week PPI+BMT regiment obtained 87.7% (95% CI, 78% to 93%) eradication rate in ITT and 88.9% (95% CI, 82% to 96%) in PP analysis. There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment modalities ([Table 2](#)). The compliance rates of the 1-week PPI+MBT group were 91.4% 'good' compliance, 9.9% 'well' compliance and 2.5% 'poor' compliance. In the 2-week PPI+MBT treatment group, the compliance rates were 91.4%, 4.6%, and 3.7%, respectively ([Table 2](#)). Overall, 52 patients reported side-effects, i.e., 19 patients (22.4%) in the 1-week PPI+BMT group and 32 patients (38.1%) in the 2-week PPI+BMT group. Diarrhea, headache, vomiting, stool color change, itching, nausea, taste disturbance, and abdominal pain were reported as side effects. There was no statistically significant difference in side effects between the two groups ([Table 3](#)). Only one patient from each group withdrew from the study due to significant side effects. The prevalence of side effects was not significantly increased with treatment duration. In both groups, most patients tolerated well the side effects and continued medication with encouragement from the physician, even when the side effects were rather serious. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow diagram showing the phases of the study progress.

      "# Abstract ## Introduction: Evaluation of students' learning in clinical education system is one of the most important and challenging issues that facilities in this field have been facing. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of feedback during evaluation in increasing emergency medicine residents' clinical skills. ## Method: The present experimental study was performed on all second year emergency medicine residents of two educational hospitals, Tehran, Iran, with switching replications design and before-after method. They were randomly allocated to two groups (with or without feedback) and evaluated three times regarding chest ultrasonography for trauma patients, using direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) and valid and reliable checklist. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20. ## Results: 30 emergency medicine residents with the mean age of 36.63 ± 30.30 years were allocated to two equal groups (56.7% male). Studied groups were similar regarding the baseline characteristics. In both groups, obtained scores showed a significant increase from the first to the third evaluation (p < 0.001). Mean scores of first and second evaluations were 10.24 ± 0.77, 17.73 ± 0.46 in feedback receivers and 9.73 ± 0.77 and 12.13 ± 0.47 in others (p < 0.001). Mean third score after switching groups were 18.53 ± 0.22 in feedback receivers and 18.99 ± 0.22 in others (p = 0.213). ## Conclusion: Based on the findings of the present study, giving feedback after evaluating the second year emergency medicine residents regarding chest ultrasonography for trauma patients, led to a significant improvement in their scores in future evaluations and consequently their skill. # Results ***Baseline characteristics*** 30 emergency medicine residents with the mean age of 36.63 ± 30.30 (29 - 47) years participated (56.7% male). They were randomly allocated to either Loghman Hakim (group 1) or Imam Hossein hospitals (group 2). [Table 1](#) shows the baseline characteristics of the participants. The two studied groups were similar regarding the baseline characteristics. 25 (83.4%) residents performed chest ultrasonography more than five times (56.7% more than 10 times) and 25 (83.3%) residents believed that chest ultrasonography for trauma patients had medium to high difficulty level. ***Outcomes*** Mean scores of the residents in the first, second, and third evaluations were 10.00 ± 0.54, 14.93 ± 0.32, and 18.72 ± 0.15, respectively. [Figure 1](#) shows the scores obtained by the residents for the 3 evaluations done based on the hospital. In both groups, obtained scores showed a significant increase from the first to the third evaluation (p < 0.001) according to Greenhouse-Geisser Correction test. Mean score obtained for preparation, scan and post-scan items among all residents were 3.34 ± 0.91, 9.48 ± 3.16, and 1.72 ± 0.97, respectively. [Tables 2](#) and [3](#) compare the scores obtained by each group in the 3 tests qualitatively and quantitatively. Mean scores of first and second evaluations were 10.24 ± 0.77, 17.73 ± 0.46 in feedback receivers and 9.73 ± 0.77 and 12.13 ± 0.47 in others (p < 0.001). Mean third score after switching groups were 18.53 ± 0.22 in feedback receivers and 18.99 ± 0.22 in others (p = 0.213). As can be seen, residents in Loghman Hakim Hospital were significantly better in the second exam both quantitatively and qualitatively. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background The effect of dietary calcium on fecal fat excretion in lactose maldigestion is not known. ## Objective To investigate the effect of dairy and nondairy dietary calcium on fecal fat excretion in lactose digesters and maldigesters during moderate energy restriction. ## Design A randomized cross-over trial comparing the effect of 500 mg vs. 1500 mg dairy and nondairy calcium on fecal fat excretion in 34 healthy adults during moderate (− 30%) energy restriction diet-induced weight loss for 12 weeks. The participants were classified as lactose digester or maldigester on the basis of breath hydrogen test. ## Measurements Anthropometric parameters and body composition, resting energy expenditure, energy and nutrient intake, fecal fat, physical activity, blood pressure, blood and urine sampling for pertinent measurements. ## Results Fecal fat loss expressed as percent of fat intake was significantly higher with 1500 mg (high-Ca) compared to 500 mg (low-Ca) calcium intake per day (mean: 3.0%; the 95% CI: 2.3 to 3.7%; *P* <0.001) independent of calcium source and lactose digestion status. ## Conclusions During moderate energy restriction induced weight loss a high-Ca diet causes an increase in fecal fat excretion independent of calcium source. Calcium intake related fecal fat loss is also independent of the ability to digest lactose and it is not diminished over time. # RESULTS A total of 51 volunteers were recruited for the study, 40 were randomized, and 34 completed the study (19 Caucasians, 11 African Americans, and 4 declaring other ethnicities). One participant was dropped due to noncompliance, and five withdrew between week 1 and week 8. Baseline and end of the study characteristics of participants who completed the study are shown in [Table 1](#). There was no difference in initial weight and body composition between lactose maldigesters and digesters and between dairy and nondairy diets (all *P* >0.05). ## Dietary intake and compliance with the study diets The participants had an average energy intake of 7.5 ± 1.5 MJ ([Table 2](#)). The average intake of energy from carbohydrates, fat, and protein was 54.5 ± 3.0%, 28.9 ± 2.6%, and 18.4 ± 1.85%, respectively. There were no differences between macronutrient and fiber content between the diets (dairy vs. nondairy). Average amount of calcium in low-Ca and high-Ca diets was 503 ± 73 and 1491 ± 131 mg/day, respectively and the level was not different between dairy and nondairy diets. There were no significant differences between the intake of protein, sodium, and potassium and their respective biological markers in weekly urine collections. Ratio of nitrogen in urine and corresponding protein intake were not significantly different between the dairy and nondairy diets (1.13 ± 0.41 and 1.01 ± 0.14, *P* = 0.105). There were also no differences between the ratios of reported intake and excretion between dairy and nondairy diets for sodium (0.96 ± 0.20 and 0.95 ± 0.19, *P* = 0.917) and potassium (1.15 ± 0.23 and 1.12 ± 0.16, *P* = 0.684). ## Fecal fat excretion The average fecal fat loss ([Table 3](#)) over 6 weeks was significantly higher with high-Ca diet than that with low-Ca diet after adjusting for gender, lactose digestion status, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 3.0%; the 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3 to 3.7%; *P* < 0.001). The fecal fat loss increased correspondingly with cross-over to high-Ca diet and vice versa ([Figure 1](#)). It was also significantly higher in females than that in males after adjusting for calcium intake level, lactose digestion status, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 2.0%; the 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.9%; *P* < 0.001). There was no significant difference in fecal fat loss between lactose digesters and maldigesters ([Figure 2](#)) after adjusting for gender, calcium intake level, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 0.2%; the 95% CI: −0.5 to 1.0%; *P* = 0.544). There was a significant positive correlation between calcium intake and fecal fat excretion in dairy (r = 0.460) and nondairy (r = 0.555) diets and in lactose digesters (r = 0.562) and maldigesters (r = 0.463, all *P* >0.05). Although not statistically significant, the average fecal fat loss over 12 weeks was higher in nondairy than that in dairy diet group ([Figure 1](#)) after adjusting for calcium intake level, lactose digestion status and gender (mean: 0.5%; the 95% CI: −0.2 to 1.2%; *P* = 0.150). In females, the average fecal fat loss over 6 weeks tended to be higher with the non-dairy than that with the dairy diet after adjusting for calcium intake level and lactose digestion status (mean: 0.8%; the 95% CI: −0.1 to 1.6%; *P* = 0.067). ## Urinary calcium excretion Urinary calcium excretion ([Table 4](#)) was significantly higher in high-Ca than low-Ca (128.3± 57.9 and 146.4 ± 77.9 mg/day^−1^; the 95% CI for difference: 3.8 to 31.1 mg/day; *P* = 0.014). The differences in calcium excretion were not different between dairy vs. nondairy diets and in digesters vs. maldigesters (all *P* > 0.05). ## Body weight and body composition After following an energy restricted diet for 12 weeks ([Table 1](#)), there were no significant differences in weight loss between dairy and nondairy diets (8.5 ± 2.7 and 7.2 ± 2.8 kg, *P* = 0.116). However, there were significant differences in weight changes in lactose digesters vs. maldigesters (9.2 ± 2.2 and 6.6 ± 2.4, *P* = 0.003). There was also significant differences between first and second 6-week study periods (5.6± 1.8 and 2.8 ± 1.7 kg, *P*= 0.001). The differences between dairy and nondairy diets were not significant during the first 6-week (5.7 ± 1.9 and 5.5 ± 1.7 kg) or second 6-week (2.9 ± 1.9 and 2.9 ± 1.8 kg) periods. There were also no significant differences in body fat changes across groups, dairy vs. nondairy (5.4 ± 1.5 and 4.1 ± 1.5; *P* = 0.393) or lactose digesters vs. maldigesters (5.5 ± 1.3 vs. 4.8 ± 1.7; *P* = 0.206). There were also no differences in the amount of total body water between the groups. ## Resting energy expenditure (REE) and physical activity There was a difference in REE between the baseline and the end of the study (7.31±1.31 vs. 6.74 ± 1.32 MJ) which became insignificant when REE was adjusted for fat free mass and fat mass (data not shown). There were not REE differences between digesters and maldigesters ([Table 6](#)). The differences in the amount of physical activity measured using RT3 accelerometers during the entire study were also not significant. Participants did not change physical activity level (PAL) during the study ([Table 6](#)). ## Blood pressure and blood parameters Diet had no significant effect on either systolic or diastolic blood pressure ([Table 7](#)). Basic hematological parameters were not different between groups (data is not shown). Diet did not have an effect on serum concentrations of insulin and vitamin D. Leptin levels decreased significantly after 12-week on the study diet independent of diet and lactose digestion status (40.6 ± 20.3 vs. 27.3 ± 16.7 ng/ml, *P* = 0.001, paired t-test). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Patterns of individual and mean fecal fat excretion with high and low calcium crossover for dairy and nondairy diets</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Mean fecal fat excretion in lactose digesters and maldigesters with high and low calcium diets</figcaption> </figure> ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background BTH1677, a beta-glucan pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule, drives an anti-cancer immune response in combination with oncology antibody therapies. This phase II study explored the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of BTH1677 combined with bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ## Methods Patients were randomized to the BTH1677 arm (*N* = 61; intravenous [IV] BTH1677, 4 mg/kg, weekly; IV bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg, once each 3-week cycle [Q3W]; IV carboplatin, 6 mg/mL/min Calvert formula area-under-the-curve, Q3W; and IV paclitaxel, 200 mg/m^2^, Q3W) or Control arm (*N* = 31; bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel as above). Carboplatin/paclitaxel was discontinued after 4-6 cycles and patients who responded or remained stable received maintenance therapy with BTH1677/bevacizumab (BTH1677 arm) or bevacizumab (Control arm). Efficacy assessments, based on blinded central radiology review, included objective response rate (ORR; primary endpoint), disease control rate, duration of objective response, and progression-free survival. Overall survival and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. ## Results ORR was higher in the BTH1677 vs Control arm but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (60.4% vs 43.5%; *P* = .2096). All other clinical endpoints also favored the BTH1677 arm but none statistically differed between arms. PK was consistent with previous studies. Although a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in the BTH1677 vs Control arm (93.2% vs 66.7%), no unexpected AEs were observed. Serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were lower in the BTH1677 vs Control arm. ## Conclusions Improvements in tumor assessments and survival were observed with BTH1677/bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel compared with control treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov registration ID: [ NCT00874107](#). Registered 2 April 2009. First participant was enrolled on 29 September 2009. # Results ## Patient disposition Between 29 September 2009 and 08 March 2013, a total of 92 patients with NSCLC were randomly assigned 2:1 to the BTH1677 or the Control arm. As shown in Fig. [1](#), 59 patients in the BTH1677 arm and 30 patients in the Control arm were treated and included in the safety and survival analyses. The blinded central radiology review primary efficacy population included 50 patients (48 patients response evaluable) in the BTH1677 arm and 23 patients in the Control arm. The primary reason for patient exclusion from the primary efficacy population was that an evaluable baseline or post-baseline CT scan was not available or acceptable to the central radiology reviewers. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation in each arm was disease progression (BTH1677, 45.9%; Control, 41.9%). Patient demographics and disease characteristics at baseline are shown in Table [1](#). The BTH1677 and Control arms were similar with respect to age, sex, race, as well as time from initial tumor diagnosis to diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to randomization. The percentage of patients with ECOG PS status of 1 vs 0 was higher in the BTH1677 arm (47.5%) than in the Control arm (33.3%). The percentage of patients who received prior cancer treatments (radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal, or other) was also higher in the BTH1677 arm compared with the Control arm. ::::table-wrap\n",

Although the between-group difference was not statistically significant, compared with the Control arm, patients in the BTH1677 arm had a higher ORR (60.4% vs 43.5%; *P* = .2096) (Table [2](#)). One patient in the BTH1677 arm had a CR while no patients in the Control arm had CR (Table [2](#) and Fig. [2](#)). While on maintenance therapy, continued reduction in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions of > 20 mm and > 10 mm, respectively, occurred in 7% and 20% of the BTH1677 arm patients, but in none of the Control arm patients (Table [3](#)). One of these continued reductions included a BTH1677 arm patient who had a CR at treatment week 47 (Fig. [3](#)); this patient remained in the study with a CR for an additional 19 weeks until the study was closed for primary analysis. ::::table-wrap\n",

The median OS of patients in the BTH1677 arm was 16.1 months (95% CI: 11.4, 20.8) compared with 11.6 months (95% CI: 7.7, 22.3) in the Control arm. However, the difference in median OS was not statistically significant between arms (HR 0.75 [95% CI: 0.45, 1.28]; *P*  = .2696). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Overall survival.

Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs occurred at a higher incidence among patients in the BTH1677 arm compared with patients in the Control arm (93.2% vs 66.7%, respectively). However, the incidence of serious AEs (40.7% vs 43.3%) and AEs leading to discontinuation (35.6% vs 40%) was slightly lower in the BTH1677 arm than the Control arm, respectively. In the BTH1677 arm, 22.0% and 28.8% of the AEs were considered probably and possibly related to BTH1677, respectively. These data are summarized in Table [4](#) . ::::table-wrap\n",

Gastrointestinal, general, hematological, and skin disorders were commonly reported AEs among both arms. Of the AEs reported in these categories, neutropenia, leukopenia, nausea, constipation, vomiting, abdominal pain upper, stomatitis, pyrexia, and chills occurred at an incidence at least 5% higher in the BTH1677 arm than in the Control arm; of these AEs, stomatitis and chills occurred exclusively in the BTH1677 arm (10.2% vs 0% and 18.6% vs 0%, respectively).

      "of patients:::: For AEs of any grade that occurred in ≥10% of patients, those that were Grade 3 or Grade 4 are also presented in Table [5](#). For purposes of comparison here, Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs that occurred in ≥5% of patients in either treatment arm included neutropenia (39.0% BTH1677 vs 26.7% Control), thrombocytopenia (18.6% BTH1677 vs 16.7% Control), leukopenia (5.1% BTH1677 vs 3.3% Control), nausea (8.5% BTH1677 vs 0% Control), hemoglobin decreased (1.7% BTH1677 vs 6.7% Control), polyneuropathy (5.1% BTH1677 vs 0% Control), dyspnea (5.1% BTH1677 vs 0% Control), and hypertension (5.1% BTH1677 vs 3.3% Control). Eight deaths (7 in the BTH1677 arm; 1 in the Control arm) were reported in the treatment phase of within 30 days of the last dose of study medication. Six of the 7 deaths in the BTH1677 arm were due to disease progression or complications of disease progression (e.g., pneumonia due to lung cancer, pneumothorax); the other death was due to intracranial hemorrhage that occurred subsequent to administration of anticoagulant for a blood clot in the lung. The 1 death in the Control arm was due to complications of disease progression (pneumonia due to lung cancer). ## BTH1677 pharmacokinetics BTH1677 serum concentrations in both cycles were above the limit of quantitation (4.7 ng/mL) for all but 1 patient. Individual t~max~ values generally coincided with the end of infusion or shortly thereafter. Mean serum trough levels of BTH1677 appeared to plateau as of Day 15 of Cycle 1, suggesting that steady state was achieved as of Day 15. Table [6](#) summarizes the PK parameters of BTH1677 from Cycle 1/Day 1 (*n* = 53) and Cycle 3/Day 1 ( *n* = 42). Geometric mean C~max~ of serum BTH1677 was similar in Cycle 1 (49.77 μg/mL) and Cycle 3 (60.50 μg/mL). AUC~0-24~ of BTH1677 was also similar in Cycle 1 (399.8 μg•hr./mL) and Cycle 3 (464.4 μg•hr./mL), with little to no accumulation of BTH1677 being observed. No notable difference in other PK parameters (CL, t ~max~, and V~ss~) between Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 were observed. A longer elimination half-life (t~1/2~) was observed in Cycle 1 (17.56 h) than Cycle 3 (7.17 h); however, these results should be interpreted with caution given the difference in sampling periods between Cycle 1 (up to 168 h post dosing) and Cycle 3 (only up to 24 h post dosing). ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing doxycycline to suppress matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). ## Methods **Ex-vivo treatment of AVM tissues:** Intact AVM tissues were treated with doxycycline for 48 hours. Active and total MMP-9 in the medium were measured. **Pilot trial:** AVM patients received either doxycycline (100 mg) or placebo twice a day for one week prior to AVM resection. Active and total MMP-9 in BVM tissues were measured. ## Results **Ex-vivo treatment of AVM tissues:** Doxycycline at 10 and 100 μg/ml significantly decreased MMP-9 levels in AVM tissues ex-vivo (total: control vs 10 vs 100 μg/ml = 100 ± 6 vs 60 ± 16 vs 61 ± 9%; active: 100 ± 8 vs 48 ± 16 vs 59 ± 10%). **Pilot trial:** 10 patients received doxycycline, and 4 patients received placebo. There was a trend for both MMP-9 levels to be lower in the doxycycline group than in the placebo group (total: 2.18 ± 1.94 vs 3.26 ± 3.58, P = .50; active: 0.48 ± 0.48 vs 0.95 ± 1.01 ng/100 μg protein, P = .25). ## Conclusions A clinically relevant concentration of doxycycline decreased MMP-9 in ex-vivo AVM tissues. Furthermore, there was a trend that oral doxycycline for as short as one week resulted in a decrease in MMP-9 in AVM tissues. Further studies are warranted to justify a clinical trial to test effects of doxycycline on MMP-9 expression in AVM tissues. # Ex-vivo treatment of cultured AVM tissues We collected two AVM tissues for ex-vivo treatment with doxycycline. These patients were not enrolled in the pilot clinical study. # AVM-I AVM tissue-I was collected from a 28 y.o. patient with a 29 mm AVM (Spetzler-Martin score 3). The patient had an AVM hemorrhage 236 days prior to the AVM resection. The patient did not receive embolization treatment or radiosurgery. AVM tissue-I was divided into 9 wells and treated with 0, 10, and 100 ng/ml of doxycycline (3 wells for each). Two doxycycline doses were selected to test (1) whether an average doxycycline concentration (10 ng/ml) achieved by standard clinical treatment has any effects on MMP-9 in AVM tissue, and (2) whether a high concentration of doxycycline (100 ng/ml) has any effects of viability of AVM tissues in vitro. There was a gradual increase in LDH release over the course of 8 days, indicating continuous cellular death and a gradual decrease in tissue viability (Figure [1](#)). However, there was no difference among different treatment groups. To avoid effects from ongoing cellular death and to ensure tissue viability during the treatment, we chose the first 48 hours to assess the effects of doxycycline on MMP-9 levels in AVM tissues. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Tissue viability assessed by LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) release.</strong> There was a gradual increase in LDH release (mean ± SD) over the course of 8 days, indicating continuous cellular death and a gradual decrease in tissue viability. However, there was no difference among different treatment groups.</figcaption> </figure> Tissue integrity was further assessed by examining H&E staining of ex-vivo cultured tissues (Figure [2](#)). On day 0 (before the treatment), although cutting and mincing of the AVM tissues had caused minor tissue injury and distortion, a majority of blood vessels were intact and viable. On day 2 (after 48 hours of treatment), blood vessels were still intact and viable, and there was no apparent necrosis or hyalinization of the tissues. However, on day 7, a major part of the tissues, especially tissues surrounding blood vessels were anuclear and hyalinized, indicating that tissues were not intact or viable anymore. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>H&amp;E staining of ex-vivo cultured AVM tissues.</strong> On day 0 (before the treatment), although cutting and mincing of the AVM tissues appeared to cause minor tissue injury and distortion, a majority of blood vessels was intact and viable.

In addition, there was a significant reduction of total MMP-9 by doxycycline at 10 and 100 μg/ml (control vs doxycycline 10 μg/ml: 100 ± 6 vs 60 ± 16%-control, P < .05; control vs doxycycline 100 μg/ml: 100 ± 6 vs 61 ± 9%-control, P < .05). (Figure [4B](#)) There was no difference in active MMP-9 and total MMP-9 between doxycycline at 10 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml. A representative zymogram is shown in Figure [3](#). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Representative zymogram showing MMP-9 and MMP-2 standard, control AVM tissues, AVM tissues treated with 10 μg/ml doxycycline, and AVM tissues treated with 100 μg/ml doxycycline.</strong> In AVM tissues, there were proteolytic bands corresponding to pro-MMP-9 (≈97 kDa) and active-MMP-9 (≈88 kDa).</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Active and total MMP-9 levels after 48 hours of ex-vivo doxycycline treatment.</strong> <strong>AVM-I:</strong> Doxycycline 10 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml significantly decreased active MMP-9 There was a significant reduction of total MMP-9 by doxycycline at 10 and 100 μg/ml There was no difference in active MMP-9 and total MMP-9 between doxycycline at 10 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml. <strong>AVM-II:</strong> Doxycycline 10 μg/ml significantly decreased active and total MMP-9. There was a trend for doxycycline 1 and 5 μg/ml to decrease active and total MMP-9. (mean ± SD)</figcaption> </figure> # AVM-II AVM tissue-II was collected from a 63 y.o. patient with a 22 mm AVM (Spetzler-Martin score 2). The patients had a history of AVM hemorrhage 167 days prior to the AVM resection. The patient received an embolization treatment 1 day before the AVM resection. The patient did not receive radiosurgery. Using this tissue, we aimed to study effects of doxycycline at more clinically relevant concentrations of doxycycline (1--10 μg/ml). Therefore, AVM tissue-II was treated with 0, 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml of doxycycline for 48 hours. Since the results from AVM tissue-I showed a relatively wide variation in MMP-9 levels in each well among the same treatment group, we increased wells per treatment group from 3 to 4. There was no difference in tissue viability indicated by LDH release among different treatment groups at 48 hours (data not shown). Similar to the AVM-I, doxycycline 10 μg/ml significantly decreased active and total MMP-9 (active MMP-9: control vs doxycycline 10 μg/ml: 100 ± 54 vs 43 ± 15%-control, P < .05; total MMP-9: control vs doxycycline 10 μg/ml: 100 ± 41 vs 59 ± 21%-control, P < .05) (Figure [ 4C](#) &[4D](#)). In addition, there was a trend for doxycycline 1 and 5 μg/ml to decrease active and total MMP-9. # Pilot clinical trial 14 AVM patients were enrolled. The trial was originally started as a double blinded randomized trial, and 9 patients were randomized. In an effort to improve recruitment for this feasibility study, we converted to an open label drug design. 10 patients received doxycycline, and 4 patients received placebo. Clinical data are shown in Table [1](#). Subjects were informed regarding possible side effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, cutaneous photosensitivity, skin pigmentation, teeth discoloration, and vestibular side effects. To monitor compliance and possible side effects, study subjects were interviewed by phone three times during one-week treatment period. One patient had nausea that was relieved by taking food with the drug. Other side effects were not noted. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## BACKGROUND: Induction of anesthesia is the most crucial period of general anesthesia. Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia. Tracheal intubation can be done after reaching the deep levels of anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (BIS) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia. ## METHODS: In a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O ~2~ ) and N ~2~ O and continued until target BIS (60 ± 2, 50 ± 2 and 40 ± 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance. ## RESULTS: BIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups. ## CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required. # Results Ninety patients including 25 females and 65 males were enrolled into the study. Mean and standard deviation of age and weight were 2.82±1.25 years and 12.13±2.86 kg, respectively (P>0.05). The mean and SD of age in groups 1 to 3 were 2.77±1.4, 2.53±1.4 and 3.18±0.8, respectively with the p value of 0.122; and these measures for weight were 12.33±2.6, 11.87±3.4 and 12.18±2.6, respectively and the p value for this variable was 0.823. The relative distribution of male/female ration in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 21/9, 22/8 and 22/8, respectively (P = 0.946). There were no significant differences in laryngoscopy duration, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement, awakening time among three groups.

      "error in numerizing # Abstract *Background*. In view of the adverse effects of using restraints, studies examining the use of restraint reduction programs (RRPs) are needed. *Objectives*. To investigate the effect of an RRP on the reduction of physical restraint rates in rehabilitation hospitals. *Methods*. A prospective quasi-experimental clinical trial was conducted. Demographic data, medical and health-related information on recruited patients from two rehabilitation hospitals, as well as facility data on restraint rates were collected. *Results*. The increase in the restraint rate in the control site was 4.3 times greater than that in the intervention site. Changes in the restraint mode, from continuous to intermittent, and the type of restraint used were found between the pre- and postintervention periods in both the control site and the intervention site. *Discussion*. Compared with that in the control site, the RRP in the intervention site helped arrest any increase in the restraint rate although it had no effect on physical restraint reduction. The shift of restraint mode from continuous to intermittent in the intervention site was one of the positive outcomes of the RRP. # 3. Results The samples in the two hospitals were first compared in terms of their demographic and clinical characteristics. The preintervention sample at the intervention facility was considerably older---mean age 75.4 (SD 10.7) versus 59.1 (SD 17.4) of the control facility (*P* < 0.001). The two samples were different in terms of the number of medical diagnosis, with the study site having a mean of 3.1 diagnoses (SD 1.5) versus the control site's mean of 1.8 diagnoses (SD 1.2) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MMSE score of the study site was 16.7 (SD 7.0) versus control site's 25.4 (SD 5.3) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MBI score was 12.7 (SD 5.5) in the study site versus control site's mean 15.1 score (SD 3.2) (*P* < 0.001). There were no significant differences found in all the other clinical and demographic variables. The postintervention sample at the study site remained considerably older, with a mean age of 74.8 (SD 10.6) versus 62.9 (SD 17.7) in the control site (*P* < 0.001). Again, the two samples were different in terms of the number of medical diagnosis, with the study site having a mean of 3.2 diagnoses (SD 1.5) versus control site's mean of 1.9 diagnoses (SD 1.2) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MMSE score of the study site was 16.4 (SD 7.2) versus control site's 24.4 (SD 6.5) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MBI score of the study site was 12.0 (SD 5.1) versus control site's mean 15.1 (SD 3.4) (*P* < 0.001). The two facilities were also significantly different in terms of their gender composition---49.0% males in the study site versus 34.8% males in the control site. No other significant differences were found in clinical and demographic variables between the two hospital samples in the post-intervention period. Then the baseline sample profile of the patients before the intervention in the study and control site were compared (Tables [1](#)(a) and [1](#)(b)). The control site had a significantly younger patient group than the study site (*P* < 0.001) in the nonrestrained patient group. This younger patient group probably resulted in the higher cognitive status as reflected in the significantly higher mean MMSE total score (*P* < 0.001) and the lower risk of fall as reflected in the lower Morse Fall Scale score (*P* < 0.001) ([Table 1(a)](#)). Restrained patients had a similar sample profile in both the study and control sites. However, significant differences were found in age (*P* < 0.01) in both the nonrestrained and restrained groups of patients between the study and control sites. A significant difference in the experiences of falling in hospital (*P* < 0.01) was also found in the nonrestrained patients ([Table 1(b)](#)). Last, the profiles of those who were restrained and nonrestrained were compared in each of the study sites. Tables [2](#)(a) and [2](#)(b) provide information about the categorical variables of the samples recruited during the pre- and postintervention period in both sites. Significant differences were found in the MBI score (*P* = 0.016) and vision (*P* < 0.001) in the study site in the postintervention period when compared with the preintervention period. The mean MBI score was worse (30.3 versus 31.5) while there were more people with normal vision (39.2% versus 51.2%) after intervention. For the control site, there were significant differences in the age (*P* = 0.039) and the Morse fall scale (*P* < 0.001) in the postintervention when compared with the pre-intervention phase. The mean age was older (59.1 versus 62.9) and the mean MFS score (20.7 versus 30.3) showed a slightly higher risk post-intervention. To answer the primary research question of whether a reduction in restraint rates had been attained in the post-intervention period, the prevalence of restraint was calculated. In the control site, the overall restraint rate (including both intermittent and continuous) significantly increased from 2.6 to 8.3% (*P* < 0.000). Both intermittent and continuous use of restraint were significantly increased in the postintervention period, with intermittent restraint use increasing from 0.2 to 3.3% (*P* < 0.001) and continuous restraint use increasing from 2.4 to 5% (*P* < 0.001) ([Table 3](#)). In the study site, there was no significant difference in the overall restraint rate between the pre- and postintervention periods although the overall restraint rate had a slightly upward trend from 11.5% to 13.6% (*P* = 0.405) postintervention. There was a significant increase in the use of intermittent restraint, from 0.7 to 5.1% (*P* < 0.001), but a significant decrease of continuous restraint from 10.8 to 8.5% (*P* < 0.001) ([Table 3](#)) was also recorded. We analyzed the subsample recruited into the RRC (those complex cases who were brought to the multidisciplinary team for discussion about their progress). In this subsample, we found that there was a significant increase of patients with their restraints taken off after RRC conference (0% versus 18.2%, *P* = 0.014). There was an insignificant but slight increase of intermittent restraint (from 14.5% to 18.2%, *P* = 0.317), and there was a significant decrease of continuous restraint after RRC conference (from 85.5% to 63.6%, *P* = 0.009). These data provided further evidence that there was a positive direction of changes in practice in the intervention site. There was a significant increase in the use of bedrails and lap tables and a significant decrease in the use of waist belts and jackets after intervention in the control site. The bed rail was the most common type of restraint (61.9%), followed by the jacket restraint and waist belt (both at 14.3%), with lap tables as the least common (9.5%) after intervention. In the study site, there was a decrease in the use of lap tables (from 48.0% to 39.2%) after intervention, but at the same time, there was an increase in the use of bed rails (43.3% to 51.8%) at the study site ([Table 2(b)](#)). Bed rail was the most common type of restraint, followed by lap table (39.2%) and jacket restraint (8.6%) in the postintervention period. Because any increase or decrease in physical restraint use may imply a concomitant change in the use of chemical restraint, the subjects' use of psychotropic medications were also examined. No significant differences were found in the use of psychotropic medications in the study site (*P* = 0.346) and the control site (*P* = 0.075) comparing pre- and postintervention data. Both sites had a low rate in the use of psychotropic drugs to begin with and remained as such after intervention. In the study site, only 3.3% of the subjects were prescribed psychotropic medications before intervention, and 2.3% were prescribed psychotropic drugs after intervention. In the control site, 2% of the subjects were on psychotropic medications, and none were prescribed (0%) after intervention. The staff profiles were examined to see if there might be the possibility of impacting on the study outcomes. In the intervention site, the staff response rate in the preintervention survey was 82.2% (*N* = 97) and 77.4% after intervention (*N* = 89). No significant differences were found in their gender (*P* = 0.535), years of clinical experience (*P* = 0.684), with or without on-the-job training about restraint use (*P* = 0.179) pre- and post-intervention. Also, no significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (*P* = 0.147), attitude (*P* = 0.071), and practice (*P* = 0.139) before and after intervention using Janelli et al.'s (1991) validated questionnaire. When further analysis were conducted, a subsample of nurses (of one unit) were found to have better knowledge after intervention (mean score results: 5.51 versus 6.23, *P* = 0.04). In the control site, the staff response rate before intervention was 51.5% (*N* = 17) and 77.8% after intervention (*N* = 28). No significant differences were found in their gender (*P* = 0.431), years of clinical experience (*P* = 0.516), and with or without on the job training about restraint use (*P* = 0.948). Moreover, no significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (*P* = 0.436) and attitude (*P* = 0.498). There was, however, a significant decrease in their practice score (from 38.41 to 36.43, *P* = 0.048). The problematic practice behaviors included item C7 (I tell family members why the patient is being restrained), C8 (I explain to the patient why the restraint is being applied), and C9 (I tell the patient when the restraint will be removed). When comparing nursing staff samples of between the study and control sites, there were no significant differences observed in their gender distribution (before intervention: *P* = 0.279 and after intervention: *P* = 0.348), years of clinical experience (before intervention: *P* = 0.369; after intervention: *P* = 0.055), and with or without on the job training about restraint use (before intervention: *P* = 0.153; after intervention: *P* = 0.176). No significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (*P* = 0.230) and attitude (*P* = 0.986). However, there was a significant difference in their mean practice score (38.41 versus 36.43, *P* = 0.037), with the control site having relatively poorer scores. ::::table-wrap\n",

      "The present study compares the efficacy of 0.5% bupivacaine versus 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.3 mg buprenorphine in minor oral surgical procedures. ## Patients and Methods: The present study was conducted in 50 patients who required minor oral surgical procedures under local anesthesia. 2 types of local anesthetic solutions were used  0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200000 epinephrine in group I and 1 mixture of 39 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200000 and 1 ml of 300 μg buprenorphine (3 μg/kg)in group II. ## Results: The mean duration of postoperative analgesia in bupivacaine group (508.92 ± 63.30 minutes) was quite less than the buprenorphine combination group (1840.84 ± 819.51 minutes). The mean dose of postoperative analgesic medication in bupivacaine group (1.64 ± 0.99 tablets) was higher than buprenorphine combination group (0.80 ± 1.08 tablets). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the onset of action of the anesthetic effect and duration of anesthesia. # RESULTS Out of total 50 patients selected for the study, there were 29 (58%) male and 21 (42%) female [ [Figure 1](#)]. The mean age of patients was 27.60 years in bupivacaine group and 27.50 years in buprenorphine combination with bupivacaine group. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Demographic data</figcaption> </figure> Patients were divided into 2 groups and the surgical procedures included surgical removal of impacted mandibular1/3 molars, incision and drainage of space infections, enucleation of cysts, dentoalveolar fractures, isolated mandibular fractures, maxillary fractures, elective implant removal, and excision of tumors [ [Figure 2](#)]. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Various minor oral surgical procedures done</figcaption> </figure> In both groups, the minimum volume of anesthetic solution used was 4 ml. However, the mean volume of bupivacaine solution including the amount needed for infiltration/reanesthesia was slightly higher (4.15 ± 0.52 ml) than the mean volume of buprenorphine combination with bupivacaine solution (4.12 ± 0.60 ml). The difference in the mean volume of both the solutions used was found to be statistically nonsignificant ( *P* = 0.84). The mean subjective onset of action in bupivacaine group (3.00 ± 1.08 min) was slightly longer than buprenorphine combination group (2.92 ± 1.03 min) whereas, on pinprick test, reverse was the case with the mean of 7.40 ± 1.93 min in buprenorphine combination group and 7.28 ± 1.59 min in bupivacaine group [ [Table 1](#)]. Statistically, no significant difference was observed between both groups regarding subjective ( *P* = 0.79) and objective onset of action ( *P* = 0.81). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the duration of surgical procedure ( *P* = 0.76) and duration of anesthesia with respect to initial recovery from anesthesia and complete recovery of sensation in both groups ( *P* = 0.32, *P* = 0.63, respectively). However, the mean duration of postoperative analgesia in bupivacaine group (508.92 ± 63.30 min) was observed to be quite less than buprenorphine combination group (1840.84 ± 819.51 min), and value was found to be highly significant statistically ( *P* < 0.001) [ [Table 2](#)]. On comparing the total amount of analgesic medication ingested during the postoperative period, the mean dose of analgesic medication in bupivacaine group (1.64 ± 0.99 tablets) was observed to be higher than buprenorphine combination group (0.80 ± 1.08 tablets). The difference between both the anesthetic solutions regarding number of analgesic tablets was found to be statistically significant ( *P* = 0.006) [ [Table 3](#)]. The percentage of patients who had taken analgesic medication in the early postoperative period (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 h) and in the later postoperative period (12, 24, 36 and 48 h) was compared in both the groups, and it revealed that the patients in buprenorphine combination group had significantly less pain during both periods [ [Figure 3](#)]. At the end of 10 h, all patients (100%) in buprenorphine combination group were pain free, as compared to only 4% of patients who were absolutely pain free in bupivacaine group. In this group, 12% of patients had mild pain but did not take analgesic medication. Only 84% of patients took analgesic medication till the 10 ^th^ h evaluation. However, at 12, 24, and 36 h, 4%, 12%, and 16% of patients, respectively, in buprenorphine combination group had taken analgesic medication as compared to 100% of patients in bupivacaine group at all time intervals. At the 48 ^th^ h, 20% of patients were still pain free in buprenorphine combination group as compared to no pain free patient in bupivacaine group. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Patients who had taken analgesic medication</figcaption> </figure> The difference between number of analgesic tablets taken in both groups was statistically highly significant at the 10 ^th^, 12 ^th^, 24 ^th^, 36 ^th^, and 48 ^th^ h ( *P* < 0.001) [ [Table 4](#)]. The efficacy of postoperative analgesia was recorded with the help of 100 mm length VAS in both the groups [ [Figure 4](#)]. Till the 5 ^th^ postoperative hour, the *P* value was found to be statistically insignificant as all the patients in buprenorphine combination group had no pain and only 3 patients in bupivacaine group had very mild pain. Difference in median postoperative pain score between both anesthetic solutions was found to be statistically significant at the 6 ^th^ and 10 ^th^ h ( *P* = 0.001). However, it was observed to be statistically highly significant from 7 ^th^ h to 9 ^th^ h ( *P* < 0.001). As all the patients in the bupivacaine group had taken analgesic medication by the 12 ^th^ h, they were excluded from further statistical analysis [ [Table 5](#)].\n",
      "## Objective To undertake 1 randomized controlled trial evaluating how to implement the recommended approach by assessing the effects of 2 different approaches on accessing of additional information. ## Methods All 11,943 participants in the Effects of Study Design and Allocation (ESDA) study, which employed deception, were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 methods of debriefing: Group A received the debriefing information in the body of an email with links to protocol and results pages; Group B was presented with these links after clicking on an initial link in the body of the email to view the debriefing information on a website. These differences between the 2 groups were highly statistically significant. Only 1/4 of Group B actually accessed debriefing information. ## Trial Registration Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12610000846022 (http://www.anzctr.org.au/) # Results The CONSORT flowchart summarizing the study design and numbers included in the analyses is presented in [Figure 1](#). Group B was approximately twice as likely to have clicked on the protocol and results links, although the proportion doing so was less than 10% in each case (see [Table 1](#)). Approximately 1 quarter of this group visited the debrief page (see [Table 1](#)) and thus accessed any debriefing information at all, however, and we had no capacity to measure the extent of any reading of the debriefing information provided in the body of the email to Group A. Approximately 1/3 of those who visited the debriefing page in Group B subsequently clicked on the link for results, and approximately 1 quarter did so for the protocol (see [Table 1](#) ).:::\n",

      "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 1 proprietary lemon verbena extract (Recoverben®) on muscle strength and recovery after exhaustive exercise in comparison to a placebo product. 44 healthy males and females, which were 22--50 years old and active in sports, were randomized to 400 mg lemon verbena extract once daily or placebo. The 15 days intervention was divided into 10 days supplementation prior to the exhaustive exercise day (intensive jump protocol), 1 day during the test and 4 days after. Muscle strength (MVC), muscle damage (CK), oxidative stress (GPx), inflammation (IL6) and volunteer reported muscle soreness intensity were assessed pre and post exercise. Compared to placebo, lemon verbena extract receiving participants had significantly less exercise related loss of muscle strength (*p* = 0.0311) over all timepoints, improved glutathione peroxidase activity by trend (*p* = 0.0681) and less movement induced pain (*p* = 0.0788) by trend. Creatine kinase and IL-6 didn't show significant discrimmination between groups. ## Trial registration The trial was registered in the clinical trials registry (clinical trial.gov [NCT02923102](#)). Registered 28 September 2016 # Results ## Group characteristics Out of 44 subjects allocated to intervention, 40 subjects (19 men and 21 women) completed the study according to the protocol (full analysis set; FAS). 4 subjects dropped out after start of supplementation and before efficacy testing. 3 of these suffered from a common cold, which did not allow them to perform the exhaustive exercise test, and 1 dropped out due to personal decision. 37 subjects were analyzed for valid case analysis set (VCAS). 1 subject had a strong common cold during the exhaustive exercise test, which may have influenced biomarker results. Another subject did not meet compliance criteria for study product intake and the 3rd subject had major deviation of the exhaustive exercise protocol. As these 3 subjects did meet exclusion criteria for VCAS analysis, they were not considered in final analysis (VCAS). Subject characteristics are summarized in Table [2](#). The nutrition frequency questionnaire scores were 45.35 ± 10.51 points in the lemon verbena group and 42.65 ± 11.33 points in the placebo group (*p* = 0.4597). Most subjects consumed between 2 and 4 portions fruits plus vegetables per day (lemon verbena: 82%, placebo: 70%). For VCAS, all subjects met the compliance criterion ≥85% and ≤115% of study preparation consumed (lemon verbena group: 102 ± 5%, placebo: 101 ± 2%). For FAS, 1 subject had a compliance >115% since much less products remained, bringing up uncertainty about correct intake, which was the reason for exclusion from VCAS. Borg scale data after exhaustive exercise and jump repetitions were not significantly different between groups (*p* = 0.8997, *p* = 0.1561).table wrap\n",

      "## Objective This study evaluated the short  and medium term efficacy and educational differences in efficacy of 1 cognitive and environmental feedback version of a Web based computer tailored nutrition education intervention on self reported fruit, vegetable, high energy snack, and saturated fat intake compared to generic nutrition information in the total sample and among participants who did not comply with dietary guidelines (the risk groups). ## Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with a basic (tailored intervention targeting individual cognition and self regulation processes; n=456), plus (basic intervention additionally targeting environmental level factors; n=459), and control (generic nutrition information; n=434) group. Self reported fruit, vegetable, high energy snack, and saturated fat intake were assessed at baseline and at 1- (T1) and 4-months (T2) postintervention using online questionnaires. ## Results In the total sample, the basic (T1: ES= -0.30; T2: ES= -0.18) and plus intervention groups (T1: ES= -0.29; T2: ES= -0.27) had larger decreases in high energy snack intake than the control group. The basic version resulted in a larger decrease in saturated fat intake than the control intervention (T1: ES= -0.19; T2: ES= -0.17). In the risk groups, the basic version caused larger decreases in fat (T1: ES= -0.28; T2: ES= -0.28) and high energy snack intake (T1: ES= -0.34; T2: ES= -0.20) than the control intervention. The plus version resulted in a larger increase in fruit (T1: ES=0.25; T2: ES=0.37) and a larger decrease in high energy snack intake (T1: ES= -0.38; T2: ES= -0.32) than the control intervention. ## Trial Registration Netherlands Trial Registry NTR3396; http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3396 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org1/6VNZbdL6w). # Results ## Participant Characteristics at Baseline A total of 1349 participants were included in the analyses. The mean age of the participants was 49.05 years (SD 10.62), 35.43% (478/1349) were male, 1.34% (18/1348) had a non Western ethnic background, and 45.66% (616/1349) were in the high educated group ([Table 1](#)). The mean daily vegetable intake was 159.12 grams (SD 69.24), daily fruit intake was 1.85 pieces (SD 1.29), daily high energy snack intake was 3.34 pieces (SD 2.98), and mean saturated fat intake was 17.91 fat points (SD 6.07). The sizes of the risk groups were as follows: 1014 participants (75.17%) did not comply with the recommendation of 200 grams of vegetables a day, 803 participants (59.53%) did not comply with the guideline of 2 pieces of fruit per day, 808 participants (59.90%) consumed more than 2 high energy snacks per day, and 627 participants (46.48%) did not comply with the age  and gender specific guidelines for maximum fat intake. The plus group was significantly younger than the control group (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, *P*=.04) and the plus group consisted of more lower educated people than the basic group (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.74, *P*=.04).:::\n",

Younger participants were more likely to drop out between baseline and T1 (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, *P*=.002) and T2 (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04, *P*<.001) compared to older participants. Dropout between baseline and T1 was higher in the basic (34.6%, 158/456; OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07-1.90, *P*=.02) and the plus group (37.3%, 171/459; OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.17-2.07, *P*=.003) than in the control group (27.2%, 118/434). Dropout between baseline and T2 was also higher in the basic (44.3%, 202/456; OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.04-1.80, *P*=.03) and plus group (48.4%, 222/459; OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20-2.07, *P=*.001) than in the control group (36.6%, 159/434). For high energy snack intake, the interaction with education was borderline significant in both the total sample (*F*~4,932.32~=2.34, *P*=.053) and risk group (*F*~4,533.59~=2.37, *P*=.051). ## Intervention Effects ### Fruit Intake Even though fruit intake increased over time (*F*~2,953.39~=38.44, *P*<.001), there was no difference in change over time between the 3 groups (*F*~4,1151.24~=1.09, *P*=.36) in the total sample ([Tables 2](#) and [3](#)). Among participants who consumed less than 2 pieces of fruit at baseline (n=803), a significant difference in change over time was found between the groups (*F*~4.523.71~=3.61, *P*=.007). The plus group had a significantly larger increase in fruit intake than the control group, between baseline and both T1 (plus vs control: ES =0.25, *P*=.01) and T2 (plus vs control: ES =0.37, *P*=.001). At medium term, the plus version also resulted in a larger increase in fruit intake than the basic version (plus vs basic: ES =0.22, *P*=.04) ([Tables 4](#) and [5](#)).table wrap\n",

The same results were found in the risk group: vegetable intake increased over time (*F*~2,654.00~=72.11, *P*<.001), but no difference between the 3 groups was found (*F*~4,671.86~=2.15, *P*=.07)([Tables 4](#) and [5](#)). In the total sample, there was a significant difference in decrease of high energy snacks between the groups (*F*~4,933.35~=5.77, *P*<.001). Both intervention groups had a significantly larger decrease in high energy snack intake than the control group between baseline and both T1 (basic vs control: ES = -0.30, *P*<.001; plus vs control: ES = -0.29, *P*=.001) and T2 (basic vs control: ES = -0.18, *P*=.006; plus vs control: ES = -0.27, *P*=.002) ([Tables 2](#) and [3](#)).

      "# Abstract ## Background and purpose The trabecular metal tibial monoblock component (TM) is 1 relatively new option available for total knee arthroplasty. These implants all appeared to stabilize at 2 years. We now present 5-year RSA results of the TM and compare them with those of the NexGen Option Stemmed cemented tibial component (Zimmer, Warsaw IN). ## Patients and methods 70 patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to receive either the TM implant or the cemented component. RSA examination was done postoperatively and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years. ## Results At the 5-year follow up, 45 patients were available for analysis. There were 27 in the TM group and 18 in the cemented group. MTPM values were similar in the 2 groups (p = 0.9). The TM components had significantly greater subsidence than the cemented components (p = 0.001). The proportion of \"at risk\" components at 5 years was 2 of 18 in the cemented group and 0 of 27 in the TM group (p = 0.2). ## Interpretation In the previous 2-year report, we expressed our uncertainty concerning the long term stability of the TM implant due to the high initial migration seen in some cases. Here, we report stability of this implant up to 5 years in all cases. # Results ## Standard outcomes and follow up All standard outcome measures for the 45 patients in this study are given in [Table 1](#). Originally, 37 patients were randomized to receive the trabecular metal component and 33 received the cemented component. Age and BMI were similar in the 2 groups at the time of admission.Values are mean (SD)\n",

There were 27/28 of the trabecular metal subjects and 18/21 cemented subjects with 2-year data recruited. The reasons for loss to follow up for the other 25 patients are documented in [Figure 1](#) and it happened mainly in the 1st 2 years of follow up. Of the patients with a high degree of prosthesis migration in the original study, all 9 were recruited to the 5-year follow up. All but 3 of the patients originally recruited to the study are still being followed by the operative surgeon, and there have been no revisions to date. The 3 patients who were exceptions had left the province. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram.</figcaption> </figure> ## RSA results The accuracy of the RSA system was 0.025 mm, 0.025 mm, 0.063 mm, and 0.026 mm for the x , y , and z  directions and maximum total point motion, respectively. The precision of the RSA system was 0.07 mm, 0.07 mm, and 0.11 mm for x , y , and z  translations, 0.16°, 0.15°, and 0.12° for x , y , and z  rotations, and 0.10 mm for maximum total point motion. At the 2-year follow up, there were no subjects \"at risk\" in the trabecular metal group (0/28). At the 5-year follow up, none of the trabecular metal components were found to be \"at risk\". At the 2-year follow up, there were 4 subjects \"at risk\" in the cemented group (4/21). At the 5-year follow up, 1 of the cemented components \"at risk\" was lost to follow up, 2 stabilized (0.09 mm and 0.07 mm of movement between 2 and 5 years) and 1 continued to migrate (0.35 mm of movement between 2 and 5 years). 1 of the cemented implants found to be stable at 2 years migrated an additional 0.42 mm and was classified as being \"at risk\". However, retrospectively, this implant had somewhat anomalous 2-year data (0.64 mm, 0.45 mm, and 0.87 mm at 1, 2, and 5 years), where the difference between 1 year and 5 years would make the implant appear stable (0.23 mm in 4 years) but the difference between 2 years and 5 years would make the implant appear to be continuously migrating (0.42 mm in 3 years). All other implants that were found to be stable at 2 years migrated less than 0.3 mm between the 2- and 5-year follow up, and were still classified as stable. The proportion of \"at risk\" components at 5 years was 2 of 18 (0.11, 95% CI: 0.03--0.33) in the cemented group and was 0 of 27 (95% CI: 0.0--0.13) in the trabecular metal group (p = 0.2). At the 5-year follow up, there was no difference in MTPM between the cemented group and the trabecular metal group (p = 0.9) ([Table 2](#) and [Figure 2](#)). MTPM values for individual subjects are shown in [Figure 3](#). Compared to the cemented components, the trabecular metal tibial components had more subsidence (p = 0.001) ([Table 2](#)).table wrap\n",

All of these implants migrated less than 0.2 mm between 1 and 2 years and were not considered to be \"at risk\" At 5 years, all of these implants continued to show stability with an average change in MTPM of 0.10 mm over the 3 years between follow ups. Using the marker configuration models, independent bead motion was detected in 5 of the high migration cases, between the postoperative and 6-month follow up examinations. The error of fit of the model marker was reduced dramatically (0.103 mm to 0.0466 mm on average) when the bead in question was removed from the analysis. The magnitude of independent bead motion was from 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm in all 5 cases. At the 5-year follow up, there was no change in the position of the independently moving bead --indicating that the deformation of the base plate was permanent.\n",
      "The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the safety and tolerability and to explore the efficacy of 1 single intra articular injection of allogeneic human mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) to improve clinical symptoms and retard joint structural deterioration over 24 months in patients following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. ## Methods In this phase Ib/IIa, double blind, active comparator clinical study, 17 patients aged 18--40 years with unilateral ACL reconstruction were randomized (2:1) to receive either a single intra articular injection of 75000000 allogeneic MPCs suspended in hyaluronan (HA) (MPC + HA group) (*n* = 11) or HA alone (*n* = 6). Pain, function, and quality of life were assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and SF-36v2 scores. ## Results Moderate arthralgia and swelling within 24 h following injection that subsided were observed in 4 out of 11 in the MPC + HA group and 0 out of 6 HA controls. Increases in class I PRA >10% were observed at week 4 in the MPC + HA group that decreased to baseline levels by week 104. Compared with the HA group, MPC + HA treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain, symptom, activities of daily living, and SF-36 bodily pain scores (*p* < 0.05). The MPC + HA group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing (*p* < 0.05), less tibial bone expansion (0.5% vs 4.0% over 26 weeks, *p* = 0.02), and a trend towards reduced tibial cartilage volume loss (0.7% vs --4.0% over 26 weeks, *p* = 0.10) than the HA controls. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov ([NCT01088191](#)) registration date: March 11, 2010﻿ ## Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13075-017-1391-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. # Results ## Baseline characteristics of study participants The baseline characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table [2](#). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, gender, body mass index, tibial cartilage volume, tibial bone area, joint space width, tibial cartilage volume, or bone area. Apart from the KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) scores for the HA injected individuals, both groups exhibited KOOS baseline scores that were below the cut off scores for individuals with physical problems associated with injured knees [[7](#)]. However, participants in the MPC + HA group reported worse KOOS pain (*p* = 0.02), symptoms (*p* < 0.001), ADL score (*p* = 0.047), and SF-36v2 bodily pain (*p* = 0.01) score than the HA alone group at baseline. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between completers and non completers at 6, 12, and 24 months of follow up as shown in Fig. [1](#) (Additional files [1](#), [2](#) and [3](#): Tables S1- S3).table wrap\n",

      "^#^ Non treatment related In the MPC + HA group, increases in class I PRA >10% were observed in 5 out of 6 patients at week 4, in 5 out of 7 patients at week 36, in 2 out of 7 patients at week 78, and in 1 out of 6 patients at week 104. In the HA alone group, only 1 out of 4 patients had increases in class I PRA >10% at week 4, and this level was maintained through to week 104. ## Serious adverse events 2 serious adverse events, fracture of the humerus and infective bursitis, were reported for patients in the MPC + HA group after week 52. ## Effect of MPCs on knee pain, function, and quality of life over 24 months There was an improvement from baseline in both groups for all the KOOS dimensions over 24 months (Fig. [2](#), Additional file [4](#): Table S4).

There was also an improvement over 24 months in both groups for all SF-36 physical components except for general health perception (Fig. [2](#), Additional file [5](#): Table S5).

Registered on 19/12/2011. # Results 1 total of 83 consecutive adult psoriasis patients with MS were screened from June 2010 to April 2011 (Fig. [1](#)). Out of 83 patients, 23 were excluded from the study. 23, 16 and 21 patients were randomized to placebo, pioglitazone and metformin treatment groups respectively. Disposition of patients and reasons for withdrawal were summarized in Fig. [1](#). Hence, 21 patients in placebo arm, 16 in pioglitazone and 18 patients in metformin arm completed the study. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flowchart of the patients enrolled in the study depicting enrollment, withdrawal and follow up of the subjects</figcaption> </figure> No significant difference was observed in baseline demographics and MS characteristics among 3 treatment groups except past history of remission (Table [1](#)).table wrap\n",

      "Low rates of asthma preventer medication adherence is 1 major contributor to poor asthma control in these patients. 58 (58) children primarily from inner city Boston with persistent level asthma were randomised to either usual care or use of BostonBreathes. ## Results After 6-months, reported wheezing improved significantly in both intervention and control groups, and there were significant improvements in the intervention group only in night time awakening and parental loss of sleep, but there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups in these measures. # Results 983 children with asthma were identified through automated medical record review.

      "# Abstract ## Background Chronic work related stress is an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases and associated mortality, particularly when compounded by 1 sedentary work environment. ## Methods 37 adults employed in university based office positions were randomized upon the completion of baseline testing to an experimental or control group. The experimental group completed a 10-week yoga program prescribed 3 sessions per week during lunch hour (50 min per session). ## Results All measures of HRV failed to change in the experimental group versus the control group, except that the experimental group significantly increased LF:HF (p = 0.04) and reduced pNN50 (p = 0.04) versus control, contrary to our hypotheses. Flexibility, evaluated *via* sit & reach test increased in the experimental group versus the control group (p < 0.001). *Post hoc* analysis comparing participants who completed ≥70% of yoga sessions (n = 11) to control (n = 19) yielded the same findings, except that the high adherers also reduced state anxiety (p = 0.02) and RMSSD (p = 0.05), and tended to improve the push up test (p = 0.07) versus control. ## Conclusions A 10-week *hatha* yoga intervention delivered at the office worksite during lunch hour did not improve HF power or other HRV parameters. ## Trial registration [ACTRN12611000536965](#) # Results ## Flow of participants 42 individuals (n = 42) expressed an interest in the study, and were deemed eligible; 5 withdrew prior to baseline testing with reasons presented in Figure [1](#). 37 individuals provided written informed consent, completed baseline testing, and were randomized to the yoga (n = 18) or control group (n = 19). 1 participant in the yoga group withdrew in week 2 for personal reasons, while 2 in the control group failed to complete follow up testing. Recruitment resulted in lower participant interest and enrolment than anticipated [[22](#)], and therefore our *a priori* calculation of statistical power was reduced from 80% to 63%. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Flow of participants.</strong> * Baseline data carried forward for 1 yoga and 2 control participants lost to follow up.</figcaption> </figure> ## Baseline characteristics Participant characteristics are presented in Table [1](#). However, due to potentially clinically important differences in BMI (p = 0.09), this variable was included as a covariate in all ANCOVA models. The cohort ranged in age from 21 to 58 years. BMI ranged from 18.3 to 39.2 kg/m^2^, and 7 participants fulfilled the clinical criteria for obesity (i.e. BMI ≥30.0 kg/m^2^). 2 participants were current smokers, while 1 had a history of tobacco use but did not currently smoke. Other than obesity, the most common chronic conditions were asthma (n = 4), hypercholesterolemia (n = 4) and hypertension (n = 5). None of the participants were presently engaged in regular yoga practice but nearly1/2 had prior experience at a beginner level (17/37, 46%).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## OBJECTIVE Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular mortality and increases adiponectin concentrations, but effects might differ according to sex and beverage consumed. ## RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 1 total of 72 healthy individuals (22--56 years) were enrolled in this randomized controlled crossover trial. After washout, 2 interventions for 3 weeks followed: ethanol (concentration 12.5%), beer (5.6%), or red wine (12.5%) equivalent to 30 g ethanol/day for men and 20 g/day for women or the same de alcoholized beverages or water. ## RESULTS Among women, adiponectin significantly increased after consuming red wine (29.8%, *P* < 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, *P* < 0.05) and consuming beer (16.1%, *P* < 0.05). 1 participant was excluded because of protocol violation. Adiponectin concentrations were substantially higher among females (means 7.6--8.8 μg/ml) than males (means 4.8--6.3 μg/ml) but also did not differ between the intervention groups within each sex. Among females, adiponectin significantly increased after intervention with red wine (29.8%, *P* < 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, *P* < 0.05) and beer consumption (16.1%, *P* < 0.04). 1](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Mean percent change with standard deviation of adiponectin concentrations from baseline after intervention with beer (B+), de alcoholized beer (B−), red wine (RW+), de alcoholized red wine (RW−), enthanol solution (EtOH), and water (W) (*<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05).</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background Elobixibat is 1 minimally absorbed ileal bile acid (BA) transporter (IBAT) inhibitor in development against chronic constipation (CC) and constipation predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS C). CC is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type2 diabetes mellitus. Effects on plasma lipids and BA synthesis were evaluated utilizing a 4-week, placebo controlled study in patients with dyslipidemia while changes of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by elobixibat was assayed in samples from a 14 day high dose elobixibat study in patients with CC. ## Methods 36 dyslipidemic patients, 21 females, mean age 63 years, were randomized to 2.5 mg or 5 mg elobixibat or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Secondary endpoints included other lipid parameters and serum 7α hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-1 (C4), a marker of BA (bile acid) synthesis. Another study, in 36 patients with CC treated with high dose elobixibat; 15 mg or 20 mg/day or placebo for 14 days, was evaluated for changes in GLP-1. ## Results In the dyslipidemia study LDL cholesterol was reduced by 7.4 % ( *p* = 0.044), and the LDL/HDL ratio was decreased by 18 % (*p* = 0.004). Serum C4 increased, indicating that BA synthesis was induced. In the CC study, GLP-1 increased significantly in both the 15 mg (20.7 ± 2.4 pmol/L; *p* = 0.03) and the 20 mg group (25.6 ± 4.9 pmol/L; *p* = 0.02). ## Conclusions Elobixibat reduces LDL cholesterol and LDL/HDL ratio and increase circulating peak GLP-1 levels, the latter in line with increased intestinal BA mediated responses in humans. ## Trial registrations ClinicalTrial.gov: [NCT01069783](#) and [NCT01038687](#) . # Results ## Results of the dyslipidemia study ### Patient flow and follow up The study flow and patient demographics is shown in Fig. [1](#). Out of 81 screened subjects, 36 patients fulfilled eligibility criteria, entered the study and were randomized to treatment with elobixibat or placebo. At baseline, the demographic parameters were similar between the treatment groups (Table [1A](#)). Patients had a mean age of 63 years (range 34--80) and there was a slight preponderance for women (58 %). Baseline lipid profiles were similar across the groups (Table [ 1A](#)).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objective To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of once daily 1200 mg and 2400 mg SPN-804 (Oxtellar XR™, Supernus Pharmaceuticals), an extended release tablet formulation of oxcarbazepine (OXC), added to 1-3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in adults with refractory partial onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization. ## Methods The Prospective, Randomized Study of OXC XR in Subjects with Partial Epilepsy Refractory (PROSPER) study was 1 multinational, randomized, double blind, parallel group Phase 3 study. The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly (28-day) seizure frequency for the 16-week double blind treatment period in the intent to treat (ITT) population with analyzable seizure data. Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50% seizure reduction, proportion of patients seizure free, and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration. ## Results Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, −38.2% (*P *=* *0.08 vs placebo) for once daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and −42.9% (*P *=* *0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg. Responder rates were 28.1%, 36.1% (*P *=* *0.08), and 40.7% (*P *=* *0.02); 16-week seizure free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3%, 4.9% (*P *=* *0.59), and 11.4% (*P *=* *0.008), respectively. When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters, a *post hoc* analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: −13.3%; 1200 mg: −34.5%, *P *=* *0.02; 2400 mg: −52.7%, *P *=* *0.006) in the North American study site cluster. A concentration -response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg. Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate release OXC. ## Conclusions Adjunctive once daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial onset seizures. # Results ## Patient disposition and characteristics Of 440 patients screened, 366 patients were randomized to once daily placebo (*n *=* *121), SPN-804 1200 mg (*n *=* *122), and SPN-804 2400 mg (*n *= 123). Analyzable seizure data for the primary efficacy analysis were available for 96.7% (*n *=* *117), 89.3% (*n *=* *109), and 90.3% (*n *=* *111), respectively (Fig. [1](#)). Of the 111 patients in the 2400-mg group with analyzable seizure data, 26 were patients in whom SPN-804 was down titrated to 1800 mg/day. Overall, 67.8% of patients completed 16 weeks, with 21.5% of placebo patients discontinuing prematurely compared with 32.8% and 42.3% in the 1200-mg and 2400-mg SPN-804 groups, respectively. Based on pill counts, 96.0% (placebo), 93.2% (1200 mg), and 95.1% (2400 mg) of patients were adherent with once daily dosing. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Study disposition for patients assigned to placebo or Oxtellar XR (SPN-804).</figcaption> </figure> Treatment groups were generally well balanced in terms of baseline demographics and disease characteristics (Table [1](#)).

However, in a sensitivity analysis evaluating the potential influence of regional differences in this multinational trial, both SPN-804 dosage groups were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction -  placebo, −13.3%; 1200 mg, −34.5% (*P *=* *0.02); 2400 mg, −52.7% (*P *=* *0.006) among patients (*n *=* *106) participating at North American study sites (Fig. [3](#)). The estimated treatment difference favoring SPN-804 over placebo was −26.1% (95% CI: −47.9, −4.1) for 1200-mg and −35.3% (95% CI: −59.1, −12.5) for 2400-mg group. In contrast, with the substantially higher placebo effect (-33.2%) observed in patients (*n *=* *231) from the Eastern Europe/Russia study site cluster (Fig. [3](#)), neither SPN-804 dosage group was significantly superior to placebo (1200 mg: −38.4%, *P *=* *0.60; 2400 mg: −41.2%, *P *=* *0.13) in this subset. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Oxtellar XR (SPN-804) vs placebo: Median percent reduction from baseline 28-day seizure frequency in the North American cluster of study sites (A) and Eastern Europe/Russia cluster (B) in the ITT population. *<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.02; **<em>P </em>=<em> </em>0.006 vs placebo.

Mean total QOLIE-31 and subscale scores did not decrease from baseline during SPN-804 or placebo administration in any group. The only significant differences from placebo in QOLIE-31 score changes were significantly smaller increases in the QOLIE-31 subscales of Cognitive Functioning in the 1200-mg and Medication Effects in both SPN-804 groups (*P *<* *0.01 vs placebo). ## Tolerability and safety The overall incidence of adverse events (Table [2](#)) was similar in the placebo (55.4%) and SPN-804 1200-mg groups (56.6%) and was lower than in patients assigned to 2400 mg (69.1%). The incidences of specific adverse events were generally similar for the placebo and SPN-804 1200-mg groups. The most common adverse events were those related to the nervous system, occurring in 31.4% of placebo patients and 38.5% of those receiving 1200 mg, compared with 56.1% in the 2400-mg group. Treatment limiting adverse event rates were 8.3% and 14.8% in the placebo and 1200-mg groups, respectively; 30.1% in the 2400-mg group discontinued due to adverse events. In the active treatment groups, adverse events resulting in discontinuation occurred primarily during the forced titration phase (1200 mg: 13/20, 65%; 2400 mg: 26/37, 70%). The fact that 23 patients were down titrated to 1800 mg also suggests some difficulty with tolerability at 2400 mg.table wrap\n",

      "*N*, total number of patients; *n*, number of patients. Serious adverse events occurred in 7 patients each in the placebo (5.8%) and SPN-804 1200-mg (5.7%) groups and in 10 (8.1%) in the 2400-mg group. Of the adverse events classified as serious, none were considered study drug related in the SPN-804 1200-mg group and 3 were considered study drug related in the placebo group (1 subject each with erythematous rash, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, or dizziness). fourth4 patient assigned to the placebo group was the only death in the study (death due to ovarian cancer diagnosed 2 days before randomization). Serious adverse events were considered study drug related in 6 patients receiving SPN-804 2400 mg -  symptomatic hyponatremia (*n *=* *1), generalized rash (*n *=* *1), dizziness (*n *=* *1), vomiting (*n *=* *1), and general drug intolerance (*n *=* *2), which was characterized by other non serious adverse events such as dizziness, diplopia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or headache. Study drug was discontinued in all patients with serious adverse events, although SPN-804 was initially down titrated in 1 patient before being discontinued due to vertigo/dizziness. Only 1 clinically significant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG abnormality was observed during the study. A shift from normal to lower serum sodium levels was observed in a relatively small subset of patients receiving active treatment (placebo, 1.7%; 1200 mg, 9.8%; 2400 mg, 6.5%). Serum sodium levels were < 130 mEq/l at any point during double blind treatment in 9 patients receiving SPN-804 (1200 mg, *n *=* *4; 2400 mg, *n *=* *5) and < 125 mEq/l in 2 patients (1 in each SPN-804 group). 1 occurrence of a markedly abnormal sodium value resulted in symptomatic hyponatremia and was classified as a serious adverse event. ## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics Based on population PK analysis of plasma MHD concentrations, the mean (SD) C~max~ of MHD was 17.9 (5.3) μg/ml in patients receiving once daily SPN-804 1200-mg and 27.1 (8.7) μg/ml in the 2400-mg group; C~min~ concentrations were 12.0 (4.3) μg/ml and 19.4 (7.8) μg/ml, respectively. Clearance was increased 31% in patients receiving carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate as concomitant therapy, but was not increased further when more than 1 of these agents was given as co therapy. In a concentration -response analysis, patients receiving SPN-804 were grouped according to estimated trough (C~min~) MHD concentrations. The breakpoint between subgroups (10 μg/ml) was determined by a sensitivity analysis. The overall median C~min~ across SPN-804 groups was 13.9 μg/ml. Median percent seizure frequency reduction was significantly greater in the subgroup with C~min~ ≥10 μg/ml MHD (*n *=* *125, −50%, *P *=* *0.02) compared with the <10 μg/ml subgroup (*n *=* *41, −35.2%) or the placebo group (*n = *117*,* −28.7%, *P *=* *0.0004); the difference in median percent change for <10 μg/ml subgroup vs placebo was not significant (*P *=* *0.57). The C~min~ was ≥ 10 μg/ml in approximately 85% of patients in the SPN-804 2400-mg group and 66% in the 1200-mg group.\n",
      "Within Pretest 2 of the German National Cohort (GNC) we therefore investigated the acceptance and feasibility of extracting vaccination status from vaccination certificates provided by the participants of the study. ## Methods This study was conducted in 3 study centers (Bremen, n = 73; Hamburg, n = 200; Hannover, n = 193). In order to test if an additional reminder would prevent participants from forgetting their vaccination certificates at home persons willing to participate in Pretest 2 were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 invitation groups (IG). About 1/3 of the participants received either no further reminder (IG1), 1 reminder card together with the appointment letter (IG2) or a separate reminder card 4 days before the appointment (IG3). Additionally, in 1 of the 3 participating study centers, general practitioners (GP) were asked to provide vaccination data from their records following respective participants' consent. Finally, we compared the influenza data from the vaccination certificates with the influenza data obtained from participants in Pretest 2 by use of a self administered questionnaire (ID Screen). In Hamburg, significantly more vaccination certificates were submitted by the group which received the reminder card separately 4 days before the examination (IG3) compared to IG1 and IG2 (*p* = 0.04). Overall, the use of a reminder card had a positive but not significant effect as 89 % (185/209) of participants who received the reminder card submitted vaccination data versus 81 % (84/104) of participants who did not receive any reminder card (*p* = 0.06). Of all Pretest 2 participants in Hannover, 62 % (120/193) gave written consent for data collection by the GPs. In total, 114 practices were contacted of which 49 (43 %) sent vaccination data. All in all, 360 vaccination certificates with 5065 documented vaccinations were entered into a database, of which 4830 (95 %) were valid for analysis covering a period from 1946 to 2012. The comparison of influenza vaccination data from vaccination certificates to the remembered data from a self completed questionnaire showed an agreement of data in 46 % (84/184) of cases (Kappa = 0.48). Influenza vaccinations were underreported in 4 % (7/170) of self completed questionnaires. An additional validation by means of documents provided by physicians seems to be possible for more than a1/4 of participants. ## Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi: 10.1007/s00103-014-2050-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. On the 1 hand, the invitation procedure consisting of 3 different invitation groups was implemented in Hamburg and Hannover only, due to a later starting date in Bremen. Consequently, all participants in Bremen invited to Pretest 2 received by default the reminder card together with the appointment letter. On the other hand, participation proportions for this feasibility study could be calculated for Hannover only, as in Bremen and Hamburg the consent for the vaccination data collection was integrated into the consent form of the Pretest 2 baseline assessment whereas in Hannover participants were asked for a separate consent. Recruitment data and participation proportions per invitation group are shown in Fig. [2](#). Overall, 400 persons were invited to participate in this feasibility study. In Hannover, 92.2 % (153/166) of Pretest 2 participants gave a separate written consent for the vaccination data collection. Again 92.2 % (141/153) of these participants brought vaccination certificates to the appointment. In Hamburg and Bremen, where participants were not explicitly asked for their willingness to participate in this feasibility study, the proportion of provided vaccination certificates was slightly lower: 80.0 % (128/160, 1 missing) of invited persons in Hamburg and 75.3 % (55/73) in Bremen provided vaccination data. Invitation group (IG): Appointment letter + … IG1: no further reminder; IG2: a colored reminder card together with the appointment letter; IG3: 4 days before the appointment at the study center a separate, colored reminder card (Fig. <a href=\"#\">1</a>). <em>*</em>Hamburg: 1 missing case with no information about assigned invitation group, <em>**</em>Participation: Participants were asked for a separate consent for the vaccination data collection in Hannover only, <em>***</em>Bremen: No documentation sheet about the invitation process available. 75 % of invited persons provided vaccination data the same day of examination or later.</figcaption> </figure> Considering the overall effect of the reminder card in Hamburg and Hannover, 89 % (185/209) of participants who received a reminder card (regardless if IG2 or IG3) brought their vaccination certificate compared to 81 % (84/104) of those who did not receive any reminder card (IG1; *p* = 0.06). The approach to send a separate reminder card 4 days before the appointment was the most successful; 92 % (94/102) participants of IG3 provided vaccination data compared to 85 % (91/107) in IG2 (*p* = 0.06). Stratifications by study center indicated that in Hannover participants in IG2 provided the most vaccination certificates (95 %), whereas in Hamburg, significantly more vaccination certificates (92 %) were provided in IG3, with no differences between IG1 and IG2 (chi square^2^: 6.546, df 2, *p* = 0.04). ## Data provided by physicians Of 193 Pretest 2 participants in Hannover, 120 (62 %) provided written consent for the data collection by general practitioners. In 1 case the consent was given but the participant had not been in contact with the health care system for a long time so that he could not provide any GP address. In total, 114 practices were contacted of which 43 % (49/114) sent vaccination data. 2 practices did not send any data because no vaccination was given during the past 10 years. ## Questionnaire The short questionnaire was completed by 94.7 % (426/450) of participants including the convenience sample. Whereas in Hamburg all participants completed the questionnaire (200/200), this was the case for 98.9 % (175/177) of the participants in Hannover, and for only 70 % (51/73) in Bremen (data shown in supplement). For example, the question, if the participant ever possessed a vaccination certificate was denied by 16 persons of whom 5 persons submitted their vaccination certificate to the study personnel the same day. A problem seemed to exist also if more than 1 vaccination certificate existed so that participants were not sure to which 1 to refer. Of all participants, 96 % had possessed a vaccination certificate once during their life time, with 91 % possessing 1 at the moment. In all, 37 % of responders indicated that the present vaccination certificate was the 1st, whereas for 55 % of responders it was the 2nd up to fourth vaccination certificate. In addition, 67 % answered to have brought all available vaccination data to the study center, 54 % included all vaccinations ever received (random sample). Tetanus (18 %), influenza (17 %) and vaccinations received in childhood (13 %) were indicated most often as vaccinations not included in documentation. The question regarding the attitude towards vaccinations was answered by 416/426 (98 %) participants. The attitude towards vaccinations was assessed by 74 % of responders as positive. Of those 18 % being critical, 45 % indicated fear the side effects of vaccinations and 30 % were concerned that vaccinations might overwhelm the immune system. Only 1 person indicated to be in principle opposed to vaccinations; for 8 % of responders vaccinations were no issues of concern. ## Capturing and availability of vaccination data Overall 372 vaccination certificates were electronically captured or copied the same day of examination, of which 7 % (27/372) of vaccination certificates were lost primarily because of missing identification numbers (ID) on the copy/scan. The procedure of blackening the personal data before capturing the vaccination data electronically was not followed consequently so that in about 17 % of documents this needed to be worked over subsequently. The quality of vaccination certificates was partly poor, especially the older ones (before 1990) often lacked the names of given vaccines (1700 vaccines), or the date of vaccination. In 5 % (222) of cases, the vaccination date was missing, (partly) illegible or cut off during the process of scanning/copying the vaccination data. Some of these data (121 dates) could be recorded as described above. The median time for data entry was 14.3 min per vaccination certificate (minimum of 0.4 min; maximum of 124.3 min). Including the data of physicians, vaccination data could be obtained for a total of 82 % (367/450) of participants or 79 % (367/466) of all eligible Pretest 2 participants. An overview of submitted vaccination data per study center (number of valid vaccination documents and vaccinations) including the sample characteristics of persons submitting vaccination data is shown in Table [1](#).

Using the example of tetanus, 27 persons provided tetanus vaccination information documented in vaccination certificates (125 vaccinations) as well as documented by physicians (54 vaccinations). In all, 30 % (38/125) of tetanus vaccinations documented in the vaccination certificates corresponded exactly with tetanus vaccinations documented by physicians for 20/27 persons (74 %). A total of 6 % (7/125) of documented tetanus vaccinations in the vaccination certificates did not correspond to documented tetanus vaccinations by physicians for 6/27 persons (22 %).

      "who submitted their vaccination certificates ## Comparison of data from a self completed questionnaire (ID Screen) versus vaccination data from vaccination certificates In Pretest 2, the ID Screen questionnaire, a self administered questionnaire about infectious diseases, was applied in Hamburg and Hannover (see Castell et al. 3 questions about influenza vaccination were included: whether an influenza vaccination has ever been received (V1), if yes, in which frequency (V2) and the year of the last influenza vaccination (V3). In total 365 persons answered the influenza questions. Vaccination documents were available for 78 % (284/365) of these participants, which allowed assessing the agreement of self reported versus documented influenza vaccinations. 1/2 of all responders (184/365) indicated having ever been vaccinated against the flu (Table [4](#)). Agreement with documentations was found for 84 (46 %) of these responders [Kappa 0.48] with up to 20 influenza vaccinations per person. Vaccination was underreported in 4 % (7/170) of cases where the receipt of influenza vaccination was negated but documented in the submitted vaccination records with up to 3 vaccinations per person. The \"unvaccinated\" responders were mostly vaccinated in 2008--2010 (7/11 vaccinations). The self reported year of last influenza vaccination was confirmed by vaccination records in 27 % of cases (41/150). In 23 % (35/150) of cases the self reported year did not correspond to the vaccination records because the year of the last remembered influenza vaccination was before (19 %) or after (5 %) the last influenza vaccination documented in the vaccination records.table wrap\n",

      "## Method 60 patients with back pain were divided into 3 groups consisting of 1) 23 adults with acute axial severe LBP who could not sit up or stand up for several days, but had not experienced previous back related diseases or trauma (group 1), 2) 19 adults who had been involved in a minor traffic accident, and had mild symptoms but not limited mobility (group B), and 3) 18 adults with LBP with radicular pain (group C)., Various MRI findings were assessed among the above 3 groups and compared as follows: disc herniation (protrusion, extrusion), lumbar disc degeneration (LDD), annular tear, high intensity zone (HIZ), and endplate changes. ## Results The MRI findings of A group were as follows: disc herniation (87%), LDD (100%), annular tear (100%), HIZ (61%), and end plate changes (4.4%). The findings of disc herniation, annular tear, HIZ, and LDD were more prevalent in A group than in B group (p<0.01). HIZ findings were more prevalent in A group than in group B or group C (p<0.05). # RESULTS The frequencies of the MRI findings were as follows: In patients with acute lower back pain (group A), disc herniation (87%), LDD (100%), annular tear (100%), HIZ (61%), and Modic change (4.4%); in patients with mild lower back pain caused by a simple vehicle accident (control group B), disc herniation (31.6%), LDD (47.4%), annulus tear (26.3%), HIZ (21.1%), and Modic change (10.5%); and in patients with severe radiating lower back pain (control group C), disc herniation (100%), LDD (100%), annulus tear (94.4%), HIZ (16.7%), and Modic changes (27.7%) ([Table 1](#)). In all groups, (80%) of the disc changes were in L4-5 and L5-S1 ([Table 2](#)).

      "In 1 controlled laboratory setting, we find that subjects randomly assigned to a treatment, in which they view a video featuring individuals that live in extreme poverty, exhibit lower subsequent productivity compared to subjects assigned to a control treatment. Questionnaire responses, as well as facial recognition software, provide quantitative measures of the affective state evoked by the 2 treatments. # Results ## Performance The measure of performance in our experiment is the number of sliders an individual correctly aligns over the course of a 10 period session. On average subjects solved 171.91 sliders with a standard deviation of 46.96 in a session. As illustrated in [Fig 1](#), subjects in the *Poverty* treatment solved 165.2 sliders as compared to 179.3 sliders in the *Neutral* treatment. This difference is borderline significant (t(97,151) = 1.534, p = 0.063). A Kolmogorov Smirnov test rejects the hypothesis that the number of sliders completed in the 2 treatments are drawn from the same distribution (KS test, p<0.01). Performance in the Neutral treatment is significantly lower than that observed by [[12](#)], where subjects on average solved 222 sliders in 20 minutes. We attribute this difference to the fact that [[12](#)] employ tournament incentives that have been proven to increase effort [[28](#)]. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0170231.g001 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Average performance by treatment.</figcaption> </figure> Furthermore, the treatment effect on performance is significant once other sources of variation are controlled for.

These tables show that the *Poverty* treatment yields a higher score on the general dimension scale of negative affects (referred to as NA from here onward), compared to the *Neutral* treatment (p<0.01). This difference stems from the higher score of the Guilt scale, composed by the items *Guilty* and *Ashamed* (p<0.001) and the higher scores of the items *Hostile* (p<0.05), and *Upset* (p<0.001), under *Poverty*. Moreover, the *Poverty* treatment also yields a higher score on the general dimension scale of positive affects (PA from here onward), than under *Neutral* (p = 0.025). This difference between treatments is driven by a higher score on the attentiveness scale, composed of the items *Alert*, *Determined* and *Interested*, in *Poverty* (p<0.05). Note that even though the Joviality scale, composed of *Enthusiastic* and *Excited*, exhibits a lower score under *Poverty* (p = 0.011), the direction of the difference in PA between treatments shows that this difference is not as large as that displayed by attentiveness. The average score of 21.036 in NA after watching the *Poverty* video is significantly larger than a typical baseline average of NA 14.8 reported by [[13](#)]. However, the *Poverty* treatment does not induce higher average positive affect than 29.7, the score observed by [[13](#)].

      "# Abstract ## Objectives: To respond to the primary safety objective of the Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial 1 (PHPT-1) by studying the evolution of haematological parameters according to zidovudine exposure duration in HIV-1−infected pregnant women. ## Setting: 27 hospitals in Thailand. ## Participants: 1,436 HIV infected pregnant women in PHPT-1. ## Intervention: Zidovudine prophylaxis initiation at 28 or 35 wk gestation. ## Outcome measures: Haemoglobin level, leucocytes, total lymphocyte counts, and absolute neutrophil counts were measured at 26, 32, and 35 wk and at delivery. The evolution of haematological parameters was estimated between 26 and 35 wk (zidovudine/placebo) and between 35 wk and delivery to compare 1 long versus short zidovudine exposure. For each parameter, linear mixed models were adjusted on baseline sociodemographic variables, HIV clinical stage, CD4 count, and viral load. ## Results: Between 26 and 35 wk, haemoglobin, leucocytes, and absolute neutrophil counts decreased in zidovudine exposed compared to unexposed women (mean difference [95% CI] −0.4 [−0.5 to −0.3], −423 [−703 to −142], −485 [−757 to −213], respectively). However, between 35 wk and delivery, the haematological parameters increased faster in women exposed to long rather than short durations of zidovudine (0.1 [0.0 to 0.1]; 105 [18 to 191]; 147 [59 to 234], respectively). At delivery, the differences were not statistically significant, except for mean haemoglobin level, which remained slightly lower in the long zidovudine treatment group (difference: 0.2 g/dl). ## Conclusion: Zidovudine initiated at 28 wk gestation rather than 35 wk had a transient negative impact on the evolution of haematological parameters, which was largely reversed by delivery despite continuation of zidovudine. Around 15% -30% of babies born to HIV positive women will themselves become infected, if the woman avoids breast feeding but does not use any other means of preventing the virus from being passed on. However, if a drug, zidovudine (AZT), is given during pregnancy the chance of HIV being passed on to a baby drops from around 23% to around 8%. In some settings it may not be realistic to give the standard course of zidovudine, from 28 weeks of pregnancy, because of its cost and complexity. 1 trial, the Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial-1 (PHPT-1) found that the short treatment course was substantially less effective at preventing HIV from being passed on from mother to baby. Current international guidance therefore recommends starting zidovudine at 28 weeks of pregnancy. The researchers who had carried out the PHPT-1 trial therefore wanted to do a subsequent analysis of data from that trial to find out whether there were any differences in these safety outcomes between standard and short course zidovudine. **What the trial shows:** In total 1,436 women were recruited into the trial and assigned to receive either zidovudine from 28 weeks of pregnancy until delivery (standard course; 769 women), or from 35 weeks to delivery (short course; 667). Blood tests were performed at 26, 32, and 35 weeks of pregnancy and then at delivery, and the main outcomes assessed in this secondary analysis were the hemoglobin levels (to check for anemia), and levels of white blood cells, including the levels of 2 particular types (neutrophils and lymphocytes). The researchers found that standard course zidovudine resulted in a drop at 35 weeks in the levels of hemoglobin and white blood cells, relative to short course zidovudine. However, by the time of delivery these levels had recovered and no significant differences could be observed between the 2 arms of the trial. A key limitation of this study is that the analyses presented here are a secondary exploration of data from the PHPT-1 trial and should therefore be seen as hypotheses to test in further studies, rather than as definitive conclusions. **Contribution to the evidence:** The analyses presented here add to the findings of the parent trial, PHPT-1, by providing additional data about the toxicity of zidovudine. # RESULTS ## Participants and Baseline Data The baseline characteristics of 1,436 pregnant HIV infected women included in the PHPT-1 trial between June 1997 and December 1999 have already been described [[8](#)]. The main characteristics are described in [Table 1](#), and participant flow is described in [Figure 1](#). In total, 667 HIV-1 women were randomized to the short zidovudine regimen and 769 women to the long regimen.table wrap\n",

Median (IQR) length of gestation was 39.0 (38.0 to 40.0) wk. Median gestational ages at pre entry and at randomization visit were 25.7 (24.6 to 26.4) wk and 27.9 (27.3 to 28.1) wk, respectively. The median duration of the 1st period (pre entry to 35-wk visit) and the 2nd period (35-wk visit to delivery) considered for analysis were 9.0 (8.0 to 9.9) wk and 4.3 (3.9 to 4.8) wk, respectively. ## Outcomes The observed evolutions of the mean haemoglobin, leucocyte, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count, between 26 wk of gestation and delivery, are presented in [Figure 2](#) by randomization arms. The mean haemoglobin level increased steadily between 26 wk and delivery in women randomized to the short regimen ([Figure 2](#)A). In women randomized to the long regimen, haemoglobin decreased slightly from 26 to 32 wk, and then increased until delivery. The mean haemoglobin levels, similar at pre entry in both groups, were significantly lower in women randomized to the long regimen at 32 and 35 wk gestation and, to a lesser extent, at delivery. The mean leucocyte ([Figure 2](#)B) and neutrophil ([Figure 2](#)C) counts decreased slightly until 35 wk and then increased sharply until delivery, with a more rapid decrease and subsequent increase in women randomized to the long regimen. The mean counts were significantly lower at 32 and 35 wk gestation in women randomized to the long regimen, but did not differ between the 2 groups at delivery. The lymphocyte counts ([Figure 2](#)D) remained stable until 35 wk of gestation and then increased until delivery, with no difference between the 2 groups. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Haematological Parameters between 26 Weeks' Gestation and Delivery in HIV Infected Women According to Zidovudine Exposure<br /> Measurements occurred at the same visit in the 2 groups.

[Table 2](#) presents the percentages of women with anaemia at different severity grades (following the WHO guidelines [[17](#)] as well as those of the table of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of AIDS [[18](#)]) and the percentages of leucopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia at pre entry, at 32 and 35 wk of gestation, and at delivery, according to the randomization arms. Between the pre entry and 35-wk visits, we found that, after adjustment on variables at baseline, zidovudine intake still had a negative impact on the evolution of haemoglobin level, leucocyte counts, and absolute neutrophil counts, as shown by the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) decrease associated with exposure to zidovudine, −0.4 (−0.5 to −0.3) g/dl/wk, *p* < 0.001; −423 (−703 to −142) cells/mm^3^/wk, *p* = 0.003; −485 (−757 to −213) cells/mm^3^/wk, *p* < 0.001, respectively ([Table 3](#)). Zidovudine exposure, however, had no negative impact on the evolution of absolute lymphocyte counts (166 [0 to 332] cells/mm^3^/wk, *p* = 0.05). During the second period, between the 35-wk visit and delivery, after adjustment, the haemoglobin level, leucocyte count, and absolute neutrophil count increased significantly faster in women randomized to the long regimen than women in the short regimen, as shown by the mean (95% CI) increase associated with exposure to zidovudine of 0.1 (0.0 to 0.1) g/dl/wk, *p* < 0.001, 105 (18 to 191) cells/mm^3^/wk, *p* = 0.02, 147 (59 to 234) cells/mm^3^ /wk, *p* = 0.001, respectively. There were no differences in the absolute lymphocyte counts ([Table 3](#)). The predicted means are described in [Table 3](#). Other than zidovudine exposure, the factors independently associated with a negative evolution of haematological parameters were low body mass index, multiparity, low CD4 count, an advanced HIV clinical stage, and high baseline viral load (unpublished data). ## Blood Transfusions Overall, 8 (0.6%) pregnant women received blood transfusions. All were exposed to zidovudine from 28 wk gestation (8/754 versus 0/656, *p* = 0.01). Among these women, 2 were transfused because of a haemorrhage (at delivery and at 7 d before delivery). 1 woman with a thalassemia trait received packed red cell transfusions at 45 and 37 d before delivery. The remaining 5 women were transfused at 0, 2, 4, 25 and 64 d before delivery because of anaemia, including 1 woman with a haemoglobin level of 4.6 g/dl who delivered a stillborn.\n",
      "# Abstract Learned irrelevance (LIrr) refers to 1 reduction in associative learning after pre exposure of the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus in a non contingent fashion. This is the 1st study to investigate the event related potentials (ERPs) of a within subject LIrr paradigm in humans. Furthermore, the effects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden on LIrr were assessed. Furthermore, in the placebo condition P3b latency was decreased for target stimuli, which were pre cued. Biperiden increased the N1 amplitude of the pre exposed predictor letters, suggesting an effect of this drug on early perceptual processing. M1 antagonism did not affect LIrr performance but seemed to influence early information processing. # Results 1 participant did not meet the requirement of at least 80% target hits and was therefore excluded from behavioural and ERP analysis. Part of the behavioural data was missing for another subject; this person was also not included, leaving a total of 15 participants. ## Behavioural data: LIrr effects [Figure 2](#) shows the effects of the LIrr conditions on RT to the target letters. In the analysis of the RT data, there was a main effect of LIrr condition on RT [*F*(2, 28)=21.73, *p*<0.001]. *Post hoc* analysis showed that RTs to the target letters were faster for the NPE compared with the RAN (*p*<0.001) and PE condition (*p*<0.001). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Effects of the learned irrelevance (LIrr) conditions and biperiden on reaction time (RT) to the target letters (means+<span class=\"smallcaps\">s.e.m</span>., ** <em>p</em>&lt;0.01; *** <em>p</em>&lt;0.001). RAN, random.</figcaption> </figure> ## ERP data: LIrr effects on predictor and target letters In the placebo analyses of the predictor letters, there were no relevant task effects on N1 amplitude and latency (*F*'s<1.69, n.s.) or P3a amplitude and latency (*F*'s<2.50, n.s.). In the placebo analyses of the target letters, there were no relevant task effects on N1 amplitude and latency (*F*'s<1.58, n.s.) or on P3b amplitude (*F*'s<1.17, n.s.). The effect of LIrr condition on P3b latency did not vary per level of electrode [no LIrr condition×electrode interaction effects: *F*(10 130)=0.44, n.s. ], yet P3b latency was found to differ between LIrr conditions [main effect of LIrr condition: *F*(2, 26)=11.99, *p*<0.001]; *post hoc* analysis showed that the P3b latency of NPE cued targets occurred earlier compared with the P3b latency of RAN cued (*p*<0.001) and PE cued targets (*p*<0.05).

RTs were increased after biperiden treatment [main effect of drug: *F*(1, 14)=12.43, *p*<0.01]. Biperiden had no effect on the LIrr index [no main effect of drug: *F*(1, 14)=0.06, n.s.]. In the placebo condition, intact LIrr is present, reflected by a LIrr index larger than 0. The same holds for the biperiden condition; in other words, biperiden failed to affect LIrr.</figcaption> </figure> ## ERP data: effects of biperiden on predictor and target letters [Figure 5](#) shows the effects of biperiden on the N1 component of the PE predictor letters. The analysis of the amplitude of the N1 peak showed that the effect of biperiden varied per level of electrode [treatment×electrode interaction effect: *F*(2, 26)=7.54, *p*<0.01] and per level of LIrr condition [treatment×LIrr condition interaction effect: *F*(2, 26)=3.94, *p*<0.05]. In the analyses of RAN and NPE predictors, there were no interaction or main effects of biperiden on N1 amplitude (*F*'s<1.98, n.s.). For the PE predictors, the effect of treatment on N1 amplitude varied per electrode [treatment×electrode interaction effect: *F*(2, 26)=7.42, *p*<0.01]; therefore we performed separate repeated measures ANOVAs per electrode. Biperiden was found to increase the N1 amplitude at Fz and FCz (*F*'s>5.77, *p*<0.05). There were no relevant interaction effects or main effects of biperiden on N1 latency (*F*'s<2.40, n.s. ), or on P3a amplitude or latency (*F*'s<2.25, n.s.)

      "## Methods This trial was performed from February 2011 to January 2014 at 2 tertiary medical centers in Germany. The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of 4 in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long term global health related quality of life (HRQoL) 1 year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months. ## Results Overall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 ± 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7--14 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after 1 year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Identifier [NCT01278537](#) # Results ## Patient recruitment The outline of patient recruitment and follow up is shown in [Fig 1](#). The final sample consisted of 652 patients. Of these, 326 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 326 patients were assigned to the control group. After 12 months, questionnaires were sent to the patients. 103 patients (15.8%) had died. We received 450 questionnaires out of 549 (79%). Loss to follow up was 15.2% (n = 99) after 12 months. Follow up after 3 months was of no concern for the primary endpoints and is not considered in this analysis. ## Baseline characteristics The socio demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are listed in Tables [1](#) and [2](#). The mean age of all patients was 72 ± 4.9 years. There were more men (68.6%) than women (31.4%). Distribution of tumor site is also shown in [Table 1](#). There were no differences regarding age, gender and tumor distribution between both groups (p = 0.5; p = 0.24 and p = 0.74 respectively). All other demographic and clinical data were comparable in intervention and control group ([Table 1](#)).table wrap\n",

Occurrence and severity of complications were comparable in both groups, although severe hemorrhage occurred significantly more often in the intervention group (6.7% vs. 2.5%; p = 0.01). Delirium screening was positive in 66 (10.1%) patients with no difference between the intervention and control group (p = 0.52). Due to postoperative complications, 75 (11.5%) patients had to return to the operating theatre. ### Postoperative stress: Mobilization, PONV and postoperative pain Patients in the intervention group reported less pain on the 1st postoperative day (75.2% vs. 82.3%, p = 0.03) ([Table 3](#)). There were no differences regarding mobilization within the first 24 hours (69.2% vs. 70.4%, p = 0.73), or PONV within the first 5 days (52.8% vs. 56.4%, p = 0.39).

In women, the mean difference from baseline global HRQoL to global HRoL 12 months after surgery was -2.63 ± 27 in the intervention group, and -  6,16 ± 25 in the control group (p = 0.37). In men, the mean difference score was -0.48 ± 24 in the intervention group compared to -1.62 ± 25 in the control group (p = 0.71).

      "## Methods The study was 1 multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 24 weeks. Participants were 328 patients aged 60 to 85 years who had 20 to 27 points in Mini Mental State Examination Japanese (MMSE J) score and 5 or less points in Geriatric Depression Scale Short Version Japanese (GDS S-J). They were randomized to receive either 1 mg/day of Pls purified from scallop or placebo. This trial is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network, number UMIN000014945. ## Findings Of 328 patients enrolled, 276 patients completed the trial (140 in the treatment group and 136 in the placebo group). In an intention to treat analysis including both mild AD (20 ≤ MMSE J ≤ 23) and MCI (24 ≤ MMSE J ≤ 27), no significant difference was shown between the treatment and placebo groups in the primary and secondary outcomes, with no severe adverse events in either group. In mild AD patients, WMS R improved significantly in the treatment group, and the between group difference was nearly significant (P = 0.067). In a subgroup analysis of mild AD patients, WMS R significantly improved among females and those aged below 77 years in the treatment group, and the between group differences were statistically significant in females (P = 0.017) and in those aged below 77 years (P = 0.029). # Results ## Study Participants A total of 328 patients were enrolled at 25 hospitals or clinics in Kyushu, Kanto, and Kansai regions in Japan from November 15, 2014 to October 8, 2015. They were randomly assigned to either of the 2 treatment groups (166 to Pls group and 162 to placebo group). Of the 328 enrolled patients, 285 continued to participate in the study for 12 weeks, and 276 completed the 24 week study period. Those who completed the study included 11 patients (4.0%) who failed to use 80% or more of the provided test substance. 1](#) shows the trial profile. No significant difference was noted between the groups with respect to age, MMSE J, GDS S-J, WMS R (0 min), WMS R (30 min), erythrocyte PlsPE, and plasma PlsPE, at baseline, although the male to female ratio was significantly lower in the placebo group ([Table 1](#)). The WMS R (0 min) and WMS R (30 min) score each showed a significant improvement in both groups, but there was no statistically significant between group difference. There was no statistically significant between group difference at any points of time, while the decrease in plasma PlsPE seemed greater in the placebo group ([Table 2](#)). WMS R (0 min) and WMS R (30 min) improved statistically significantly in the treatment group, and the improvement seemed greater in the Pls treatment group with respect to the 0 min value (P = 0.067) and the 30-min value (P = 0.078) ([Table 3](#)). ### Subgroup Analysis by Gender and Age Furthermore, we analyzed the cognitive function in patients with mild AD patients by gender and age ([Table 4](#)). Mild AD patients were divided into 2 groups based on the median value, 77 years or younger and 78 years or older. In the patients aged 77 years or younger, WMS R (30 min) increased statistically significantly in the treatment group, showing a significant between group difference (P = 0.029). In female patients with mild AD, WMS R (30 min) improved significantly in the treatment group, with a significant between group difference (P = 0.017). ### Changes in Blood Plasmalogens The changes in blood PlsPE levels among mild AD patients were examined ([Table 5](#)). Plasma PlsPE decreased in the placebo group, showing a significant between group difference (P = 0.016). There was a statistically significant elevation of erythrocyte PlsPE at week 16 in the treatment group and at week 24 in placebo. However, the changes were not significantly different between the 2 groups. ## Clinical Safety [Table 6](#) summarizes adverse events. There was no notable difference in the occurrence of adverse events between the 2 groups. 1 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Trial profile.</figcaption> </figure>:::\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objectives Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of peer led self management education in improving glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in 1 low income country (Mali). A total of 151 adults (76% women, mean age 52.5) with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c≥8%), treated in the diabetes consultation units of 2 secondary health centres in Bamako, were allocated to peer led structured patient education (n = 76) or conventional care alone (n = 75). The intervention group received 1 year of culturally tailored structured patient education (3 courses of 4 sessions) delivered in the community by 5 trained peer educators. Primary outcome was the mean absolute change in HbA1c from baseline to 12 months. ## Results 177 education sessions were delivered to the intervention group. Patient attrition was 8%. From baseline to 12 months, the decrease in HbA1c levels was 1.05% (SD = 2.0; CI95%: 1.54;-0.56) in the intervention group compared with 0.15% (SD = 1.7; CI95%: -0.56; 0.26) in the control group, p = 0.006. Mean BMI change was -1.65 kg/m2 (SD = 2.5; CI95%: -2.25; -1.06) in the intervention group and +0.05 kg/m2 (SD = 3.2; CI95%: -0.71; 0.81) in the control group, p = 0.0005. Mean waist circumference decreased by 3.34 cm (SD = 9.3; CI95%: -5.56;-1.13) in the intervention group and increased by 2.65 cm (SD = 10.3; CI95%: 0.20; 5.09) in the control group, p = 0.0003. ## Conclusions Peer led structured patient education delivered over 1 year to patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in Mali yielded substantial improvements in glycaemic control and anthropometric parameters. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01485913](#) # Results From July, 21st to September, 30^th^, 2011, we included 151 patients in the study: 76 in the intervention group and 75 in the control group ([Fig 1](#)). Study participants were mostly female (n = 115, 76.2%) and the majority were overweight (BMI> = 25: n = 110, 72.9%). third3 of the sample presented high blood pressure (n = 51, 33.8%). The mean HbA1c level was 10.6% (standard deviation (sd = 1.8) and 10.8% (sd = 1.9) in the intervention arm and the control arm, respectively. At baseline, patients' characteristics in the 2 groups were similar ([Table 1](#)). Educational courses took place between October and December 2011, April and July 2012, August December 2012. The follow up of participants from both groups took place between 1^st^ October 2011 and 20 ^th^ February 2013. The reasons for this slight delay in scheduled courses and follow ups were that due to political events in Mali during 2012 we had to post pone the 2nd and1/3 education session courses in the intervention arm, and the corresponding follow ups (February 2012, July 2012, January 2013). The patterns of withdrawal are documented in [Fig 1](#). Overall, the 5 PEs facilitated 177 educational sessions with a mean of 6.4 patients per group session in the intervention group. Among intervention patients, 70 attended the 3 courses. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0191262.g001 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow chart of participants.<br /> ST2EP trial.</figcaption> </figure>table wrap\n",

Similarly, the evolution of BMI and WC was more favourable in the intervention group than in the control group (p = 0.001 for BMI and WC; [Fig 3](#)).

      "## Methods 12 adults with high functioning ASD engaged in 1 battery of WM tasks that included backward spatial span, backward digit span, spatial *n* back and letter *n* back. While engaged, 40 min of 1.5 mA bifrontal stimulation was applied over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Using a single blind crossover design, each participant received left anodal/right cathodal stimulation, right anodal/left cathodal stimulation, or sham stimulation, in randomized counterbalanced order on 3 separate days. We used repeated measures ANOVA to compare overall performance on the WM battery as measured by a composite of *z* scores for all 5 measures. ## Results Compared to sham stimulation, both left DLPFC anodal stimulation (*t*~11~ = 5.4, *p* = 0.0002) and right DLPFC anodal stimulation (*t*~11~ = 3.57, *p* = 0.004) improved overall WM performance. Left anodal stimulation (*t*~11~ = 3.9, *p* = 0.003) and right anodal stimulation (*t*~11~ = 2.7, *p* = 0.019) enhanced performances during stimulation. Enhancement transferred to an untrained task 50 min after right anodal stimulation *(z*~11~ = 2.263, *p* = 0.024). The tasks that showed the largest effects of active stimulation were spatial span backward (*z*~11~ = 2.39, *p* = 0.017) and BTA (*z*~11~ = 2.263, *p* = 0.024). ## Trial registration [NCT01602263](#) # Results ## Primary outcome: overall WM performance As shown in the final row of Table [1](#), the composite *z* scores (full battery) were −0.25 (SD 0.71) for sham stimulation, 0.13 (SD 0.82) for left anodal stimulation, and 0.11 (SD 0.81) for right anodal stimulation, which repeated measures ANOVA showed to be significantly different (*F*~2,22~ = 12.85, *p* = 0.0002). Post hoc, paired sample *t* tests revealed that performances associated with both left anodal active stimulation (*t*~11~ = 5.4, *p* = 0.0002) and right anodal active stimulation (*t*~11~ = 3.57, *p* = 0.004) were better than performances associated with sham tDCS. For composite *z* scores (full battery), Cohen's *d*~*s*~ effect sizes were 0.50 for left anodal stimulation and 0.47 for right anodal stimulation. There was no difference in overall WM performance between the 2 active stimulation conditions (*t*~11~ = 0.26, *p* = 0.796). We found composite *z* scores (full battery) of −0.03 (SD 0.81) for session 1, −0.06 (SD 0.75) for session 2, and 0.09 (SD 0.83) for session 3.

Post hoc, paired sample *t* tests revealed that performances as measured by composite *z* scores of the 4 working memory tests given during both left anodal active stimulation (*t*~11~ = 3.9, *p* = 0.003, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.52) and right anodal active stimulation (*t*~11~ = 2.7, *p* = 0.019, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.46) were better than performances during sham stimulation. Performances during the 2 active stimulation conditions (*t*~11~ = 0.60, *p* = 0.563) were not significantly different. The composite *z* scores (offline) were −0.18 (SD 0.92) for sham stimulation, 0.09 (SD 0.77) for left anodal stimulation, and 0.09 (SD 0.93) for right anodal stimulation, which Friedman's test showed to be significantly different (χ^2^ = 7.17, *p* = 0.028). Follow up Wilcoxon signed rank tests showed that after left anodal stimulation performances were not significantly better compared to after sham stimulation (*z* = 1.88, *p* = 0.06, *r* = 0.27, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.33), but performances after right anodal stimulation were significantly better than after sham stimulation (*z* = 2.35, *p* = 0.019, *r* = 0.34, Cohen's *d*~*s*~ = 0.30). Although performances after right anodal stimulation were marginally better than after left anodal stimulation, the difference was not significant (*z* = 1.49, *p* = 0.136). ## Secondary outcomes: individual WM measures Mean (SD) scores for each of the 5 measures that made up our overall WM composite are presented in Table [1](#). As shown in the 1st row, the participants' longest backward spatial span was 4.8 (SD 0.9) blocks during sham stimulation compared to 6.2 (SD 1.8) blocks during left anodal stimulation and 6.0 (SD 0.9) blocks during right anodal stimulation. Friedman's test showed that these differed significantly (χ^2^ = 9.24, *p* = 0.010). Post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank tests indicate that left anodal stimulation (*z*~11~ = 2.21, *p* = 0.027, *r* = 0.32) and right anodal stimulation (*z*~11~ = 2.39, *p* = 0.017, *r* = 0.34) were both associated with longer maximum spans than sham stimulation. Cohen's *d*~*s*~ effect sizes were 1.03 for left anodal stimulation and 1.39 for right anodal stimulation. Performances during the 2 active stimulation conditions were not different (*z*~11~ = 0.30, *p* = 0.762). Participants' longest spatial span was 5.6 blocks (SD 1.2) during session 1, 5.5 blocks (SD 1.1) during session 2, and 5.9 blocks (SD 1.8) during session 3. Friedman tests showed no significant practice effects across sessions (χ^2^ = 0.05, *p* = 0.973). Also as shown in Table [1](#), participants' longest backward digit span averaged 5.3 (SD 1.5) digits during sham compared to 5.5 (SD 1.6) digits during left anodal and 5.4 (SD 2.0) during right anodal stimulation. Friedman's test showed no significant differences in longest digit span between conditions (χ^2^ = 0.41, *p* = 0.814). Online *n* back accuracy was 62.4% (SD 25.0%) during sham stimulation, 68.6% (SD 22.1%) during left anodal stimulation, and 66.7% (SD 23.2%) during right anodal stimulation. Friedman's test showed no significant differences between conditions (χ^2^ = 3.17, *p* = 0.205). Offline spatial *n* back accuracy was 63.9% (SD 24.9%) after sham stimulation, 70.6% (SD 20.9%) after left anodal stimulation, and 67.7% (SD 24.2%) after right anodal stimulation, which were not significantly different (χ^2^ = 0.55, *p* = 0.758). Online *n* back accuracy was 69.6% (SD 30.2%) during sham stimulation, 76.2% (SD 22.5%) during left anodal stimulation, and 76.3% (SD 26.8%) during right anodal stimulation. These were not significantly different (χ^2^ = 0.5, *p* = 0.779). Offline letter *n* back accuracy was 72.3% (SD 29.8%) after sham stimulation, 78.5% (SD 22.5%) after left anodal stimulation, and 76.5% (SD 25.9%) after right anodal stimulation. These also were not significantly different (χ^2^ = 0.17, *p* = 0.920). Brief Test of Attention (BTA) raw scores averaged 6.8 (SD 2.5) after sham stimulation compared to 7.4 (SD 2.2) after left anodal and 7.9 (SD 2.5) after right anodal stimulation. We found the predicted main effect of condition on BTA performance with Freidman's test (χ^2^ = 7.09, *p* = 0.029).

      "## Methods: 1 series of 42 patients presenting with obstructive pyelonephritis due to proximal ureteral stones larger than 1.5 cm were included from April 2006 to February 2015 in this comparative study. After drainage of pyonephrosis and resolution of sepsis, 22 patients treated with TPLU (Group I), and 20 patients were treated with F URS (Group II). However TPLU provided a higher stone  free rate (100% vs 80%. p=0.043) and lower retreatment rate. On the other hand, patients treated with F URS had less postoperative pain (p=0.008), a shorter hospital stay (p<0.001) and a faster return to daily activities (p<0.001). # RESULTS ## Patient and Stone Characteristics The present study included 26 (61.9%) men and 16 (38.1%) women. Group I consisted of 22, and group II consisted of 20 patients. The mean BMI were 25.9±2.3 kg/m ^2^ and 27.8±1.3 kg/m ^2^ in group I and II, respectively (p=0.002).patients (%) 22 20 \n",

      "Patients' increase in disease knowledge may serve as 1 feedback to the educator on how well the education program works -  but may not be associated to relevant clinical outcomes like quality of life (QoL). ## Methods Patients with GERD were randomly allocated to education (102 patients) or control (109 patients). Outcomes were a 24 item knowledge test on GERD (score 0 -  24) 2 and 12 months after the educational program and disease specific and general QoL (Digestive symptoms and disease impact, DSIQ, and General Health Questionnaire, GHQ). ## Results Patients allocated to education achieved higher knowledge test scores than controls at 2 months (17.0 vs. 13.1, p < 0.001) and at 12 months (17.1 vs. 14.0, p < 0.001) follow up. ## Conclusion A group based education program for patients with GERD designed as a structured dialogue increased patients' disease knowledge, which was retained after 1 year. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT0061850 # Results ## Patients Of 211 patients who were included, 102 were randomly allocated to GERD education and 109 to control. The GERD -education and control groups did not differ statistically with regards to socio demographic variables; disease history or disease characteristics (Table [1](#) ). Of the patients who were allocated to GERD -education, 58 (56.9%) attended 3 lessons, 27 (26.5%) 2 and 5 (4.9%) 1 lesson. 12 patients (11.8%) did not meet at all, of whom 5 were not able due to work or private obligations, 4 gave no reasons, 2 on grounds of other diseases and 1 did not wish to participate. At 2 months follow up 90 patients (88%) in the GERD -education group and 100 patients (92%) in the control group responded completely. At 12 months 85 (83%) and 88 patients (81%) gave complete responses respectively.:::\n",

      "This is 1 secondary analysis of previously published data to investigate the effects of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) on strength of various muscle groups in critically ill patients. 142 consecutive patients, with APACHE II score ≥ 13, were randomly assigned to the EMS or the control group. 24 patients in the EMS group and 28 patients in the control group were finally evaluated. EMS patients achieved higher MRC scores than controls (*P* ≤ 0.05) in wrist flexion, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion. Collectively, the EMS group performed higher (*P* < 0.01) in the legs and overall. Handgrip strength correlated (*P* ≤ 0.01) with the upper and lower extremities' muscle strength and the overall MRC scores. # 3. Results Patient recruitment flow chart, as previously reported [[17](#)], is presented in [Figure 1](#). 52 patients were finally evaluated, 24 in the EMS group and 28 patients in the control group. Baseline characteristics of all patients in the EMS and control groups have been previously reported [[17](#)]. Baseline characteristics of patients finally evaluated in both groups are presented in [Table 1](#). The MRC scores of all the movements of the upper and lower extremities assessed are presented in [Table 2](#). No statistical differences were found between the 2 groups in all other movements. Similar between group results were found for the total MRC score of the arms (EMS: 28 (26--30); control: 26 (22--30), *P* = 0.16) and the legs (EMS: 29 (26--30); control: 25 (20--28), *P* = 0.01). The overall MRC score was significantly higher in patients assigned to the EMS group in comparison to the control group (58 (51--60) versus 52 (40--58), *P* = 0.04) ([Figure 2](#)). In concern to the baseline characteristics of the subgroup in which handgrip dynamometry was applied (*n* = 21), no difference was found between the control (*n* = 9) and the EMS group (*n* = 12) in gender (males/females, 6/3 versus 10/2, *P* = 0.61), age (65 ± 22 versus 61 ± 14 years, *P* = 0.25), or APACHE II score (19 ± 4 versus 17 ± 4, *P* = 0.46). No difference was observed between the EMS and the control group in handgrip strength either in absolute (21.4 ± 10.8 versus 14.8 ± 10.7 kg, resp., *P* = 0.18) or relative (60.2 ± 27.3% predicted versus 49.1 ± 28.5% predicted, resp., *P* = 0.38) values. A significant difference was found in handgrip strength between patients diagnosed with ICU AW in comparison to those without an ICU AW diagnosis (6.6 ± 4.4 versus 23.4 ± 8.9 kg, *P* < 0.01), even when the comparison was adjusted for gender and age (*P* < 0.01). This was also the case when handgrip performance was expressed in relative values (29.0 ± 22.4% predicted versus 66.0 ± 22.2% predicted, *P* < 0.01). In concern to between sides comparison, patients tended to perform better with the dominant rather than the non dominant hand (16.2 ± 11.1 versus 14.2 ± 9.9 kg, resp., *P* = 0.09). 3 patients performed better with the left hand, and in another 3 patients, there was no difference between hands. The 95% limits of agreement were also calculated and found to range from −7.1 to 10.3 kg. In relation to between trial comparisons, no difference was observed over the 5 trials performed (1st: 16.1 ± 10.5 kg, 2nd: 16.8 ± 10.8 kg, 3rd: 16.9 ± 11.5 kg, 4th: 16.6 ± 11.0, and 5th: 17.1 ± 11.5 kg, *P* = 0.44). Finally, handgrip strength in absolute values correlated (*P* < 0.01) with the MRC score of upper extremities (*r* = 0.78), lower extremities (*r* = 0.73), and the overall (*r* = 0.79) MRC scores ([Figure 3](#)). The respective correlation coefficients (*P* ≤ 0.01) for handgrip strength in relative values (% predicted) were 0.58, 0.53, and 0.55. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow chart diagram of the patients admitted to the ICU during the 30-month study period. *Significant between group difference (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05).</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Correlation between handgrip dynamometry performance (in absolute values) and the upper (a), lower (b), and overall (c) MRC scores (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.01).</figcaption> </figure>table wrap\n",

      "## Objective: Examine the effects of daclizumab beta versus intramuscular (IM) interferon (IFN) beta-1a on cognitive processing speed as assessed by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). ## Methods: In DECIDE, patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) (age: 18--55 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 0--5.0) were randomized to daclizumab beta ( *n* = 919) or IM IFN beta-1a ( *n* = 922) for 96--144 weeks. SDMT was administered at baseline and at 24-week intervals. ## Results: At week 96, significantly greater mean improvement from baseline in SDMT was observed with daclizumab beta versus IM IFN beta-1a ( *p* = 0.0274). Significantly more patients treated with daclizumab beta showed clinically meaningful improvement in SDMT (increase from baseline of ⩾3 points ( *p* = 0.0153) or ⩾4 points ( *p* = 0.0366)), and significantly fewer patients showed clinically meaningful worsening (decrease from baseline of ⩾3 points ( *p* = 0.0103)). Odds representing risk of worsening versus stability or improvement on SDMT were significantly smaller for daclizumab beta ( *p* = 0.0088 (3-point threshold); *p* = 0.0267 (4-point threshold)). In patients completing 144 weeks of treatment, the effects of daclizumab beta were generally sustained. ## Conclusion: These results provide evidence for 1 benefit of daclizumab beta versus IM IFN beta-1a on cognitive processing speed in RRMS. ## Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01064401 (Efficacy and Safety of BIIB019 (Daclizumab High Yield Process) Versus Interferon β 1a in Participants With Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DECIDE)): [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01064401](#) . # Results ## Descriptive data A total of 1841 patients were randomized (daclizumab beta, *n* = 919; IM IFN beta-1a, *n* = 922). ^[18](#)^At baseline, in the daclizumab beta and IM IFN beta-1a groups, mean (SD) SDMT score was 48.5 (15.9) and 47.7 (16.1), respectively, and median (range) SDMT score was 49 (0--110) and 49 (3--110), respectively. ## Group effects on SDMT Based on the linear mixed model analysis approach, there was a significant group × time interaction ( *p* = 0.0004). Significantly greater mean improvement from baseline in SDMT scores was observed with daclizumab beta compared with IM IFN beta-1a at week 96 (mean (SD) change from baseline: 4.1 (12.4) vs 2.9 (12.7); *p* = 0.0274), as reported previously ( [Figure 1](#) ). ^[18](#)^This effect was sustained at week 144 (6.3 (12.6) vs 3.1 (13.2); *p* = 0.0024) in a limited number of patients completing 144 weeks of treatment with available SDMT scores (daclizumab beta, *n* = 287; IM IFN beta-1a, *n* = 277). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Mean change from baseline in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score at weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, and 144.

      "## RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This prospective, 4-year, placebo controlled study randomly assigned 48 African American subjects with DKA and severe hyperglycemia to metformin 1,000 mg daily (*n* = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg daily (*n* = 16), or placebo (*n* = 15) after normoglycemia remission. Hyperglycemic relapse was defined as fasting glucose >130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and HbA~1c~ >7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at randomization and at 3 months and then every 6 months for 1 median of 331 days. ## RESULTS Relapse free survival was higher in sitagliptin and metformin (*P* = 0.015) compared with placebo, and mean time to relapse was significantly prolonged in the metformin and sitagliptin groups compared with the placebo group (480 vs. 305 days, *P* = 0.004). The probability of relapse was significantly lower for metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10--0.81]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10--0.98]) than for placebo. Subjects who remained in remission had a higher DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) than those with hyperglycemia relapse without significant changes in Si. # Results 48 African American subjects with DKA (*n* = 22) and severe hyperglycemia (*n* = 26) were included in the study. 17 subjects were randomly assigned to metformin 1,000 mg daily, 16 to sitagliptin 100 mg daily, and 15 to placebo. 4 subjects in the metformin group, 6 in the sitagliptin group, and 1 in the placebo group were lost to follow up. 1 subject in the sitagliptin group and 1 subject in the placebo group withdrew from the study. The overall median follow up after insulin discontinuation was 331 days (interquartile range 102, 612 days) with no differences between randomized groups ([Table 1](#)). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics at presentation between subjects who withdrew and those who stayed in the study, except for HbA~1c~. HbA~1c~ was lower at presentation of DKA/hyperglycemia in subjects who withdrew compared with those who stayed (12.0 ± 2.3% [107 ± 25 mmol/mol] vs. 13.5 ± 2.0% [124 ± 22 mmol/mol], *P* = 0.03) but was similar at randomization.table wrap\n",

Hyperglycemia relapse free survival was significantly higher in the metformin and sitagliptin groups than in the placebo group (*P* = 0.015) ([Fig. 1](#)). The 2-year failure rate was higher in the placebo than in the sitagliptin (77% vs. 44%, *P* = 0.113) or metformin (77% vs. 34%, *P* = 0.013) groups. Compared with placebo, patients randomized to metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10--0.814]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10--0.98]) were ∼70% less likely to have a hyperglycemia relapse. However, there was no difference in hyperglycemia relapse free survival between metformin and sitagliptin (*P* = 0.75) ([Fig. 1](#)). The restricted mean time to hyperglycemia relapse in the combined metformin and sitagliptin groups was significantly higher than placebo (480 vs. 305 days, *P* = 0.004). A significant difference was found among the placebo, metformin, and sitagliptin groups (<em>P</em> = 0.015), but no significant difference was found between the sitagliptin and metformin groups (<em>P</em> = 0.75).</figcaption> </figure> We also assessed whether being on medication decreased the severity of hyperglycemia relapse. Because only a small number of subjects experienced relapse in the medication groups (metformin [*n* = 5], sitagliptin [*n* = 4]) compared with placebo (*n* = 11), we combined the metformin and sitagliptin groups. There were no significant differences in HbA~1c~ (8.0 ± 0.8% [64 ± 9 mmol/mol] vs. 8.2 ± 1.5% [66 ± 16 mmol/mol], *P* = 0.79) or blood glucose (152 ± 18 mg/dL [8.4 ± 1 mmol/L] vs. 160 ± 68 mg/dL [8.9 ± 3.8 mmol/L], *P* = 0.65) levels at the time of hyperglycemia relapse between the placebo group and the combined metformin and sitagliptin group. In the placebo group, 3 of the 11 subjects who experienced hyperglycemia relapse presented to the emergency department with a glucose level >400 mg/dL (22.2 mmol/mol) or DKA. Over the course of the study, DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) were significantly higher in subjects who remained in near normoglycemia remission compared with those who had a hyperglycemia relapse without any differences in Si (*P* = 0.75). There was a significant interaction between remission status and study visit for both Si (*P* = 0.01) and DI (*P* = 0.02), suggesting a different pattern of change in Si and DI over time between subjects with near normoglycemia remission and hyperglycemia relapse. 2*A* and *B*](#)). 2*C*](#)); however, DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) were significantly higher in subjects who stayed in near normoglycemia remission than in those who had a hyperglycemia relapse at the end of the study ([Fig. 2*A* and *B*](#)). 2 promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating (ie, eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals) and the development of greater psychological flexibility (ie, the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT]).ObjectivesThis pilot study investigated the usage, acceptability, and feasibility of “Mind, Body, Food,” a Web based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills.MethodsParticipants were 40 overweight women (mean age 44.8 [standard deviation, SD, 3.06] years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32.9 [SD 6.01] kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean Intuitive Eating Scale [IES-1] total score 53.4 [SD 7.46], classified as below average) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin, New Zealand. BMI, intuitive eating, binge eating, psychological flexibility, and general mental and physical health were assessed pre  and postintervention and 3-months postintervention.ResultsOf the 40 women enrolled in the study, 12 (30%) completed all 12 modules (median 7.5 [interquartile range, IQR, 2-12] modules) and 4 (10%) used the self monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period (median 3 [IQR 1-9] weeks). Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments, most women rated “Mind, Body, Food” as useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%) and liked the intervention (22/25, 88%). From pre  to postintervention, there were statistically significant within group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score <em>P</em>&lt;.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: <em>P</em> ≤.01), psychological flexibility (<em>P</em>=.01), and general mental health (<em>P</em>&lt;.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (<em>P</em>=.01). At the 3-month follow up, IES-2 improvements were maintained, and there were further improvements in binge eating (<em>P</em>&lt;.001) and general mental health (<em>P</em>=.03), and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility (<em>P</em>=.06). There were no significant within group changes in BMI from pre  to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow up (<em>P</em>=.46 and <em>P</em>=.93, respectively).ConclusionsThe “Mind, Body, Food” prototype Web based intervention is appealing to middle aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills, reduce binge eating, and maintain weight over 3 months. Further work to improve the user experience and engagement is required before testing the online intervention in a randomized controlled trial.ResultsRecruitment and RetentionDuring recruitment, of the 97 women who expressed interest in the study, 75 women met preliminary screening criteria and subsequently were invited to complete the online eligibility assessment. 5 women did not complete the online eligibility assessment, and only 45 women met the study inclusion criteria (see <a href=\"#\">Figure 6</a> for reasons women were excluded). A total of 40 women were enrolled in the study from August to September 2014. The postintervention retention rate was 65% (26/40) and 63% (25/40) at the 3-month follow up. Although the attrition rate was similar to that predicted (30%), the sample size at follow up was lower than had been aimed for due to the number of women not meeting eligibility criteria. <a href=\"#\">Figure 6</a> presents the flow of participants through the study.Figure 6\"Mind, Body, Food\" study participant flow diagram.Baseline Characteristics<a href=\"#\">Table 2</a> presents the sample’s demographic characteristics at baseline in comparison with corresponding NZ Census data. The sample was overrepresentative of NZ European women (30/37, 81.1% vs 69.8%) but similarly representative of Māori (4/37, 10.8% vs 11.7%) and Pacific (1/37, 2.7% vs 4.4%) women. University educated women were overrepresented (21/37, 56.8% vs 17.7%). Women with NZSEI-06 (estimating socioeconomic status) scores in the lower 2 quartiles were underrepresented (10-33: 2/37, 5.4% vs 23.1%, 34-44: 3/37, 8.1% vs 29.4%).1/2 (18/36, 50.0%) of women reported dieting for 20 years or longer. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics or other measures such as intuitive eating, binge eating, general mental health, psychological inflexibility, and BMI between women who were retained and not retained at 3-month follow up.

A programming delay prevented monitoring from the start of the study, which explains missing usage data for 3 women. Of the 37 participants for whom usage data were available, 12 (32%) completed all 12 modules, 11 (30%) completed 7 to 11 modules, 12 (32%) completed 1 to 6 modules, and 2 women (5%) completed no modules. The median number of modules completed was 7.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-12) modules. The median number of sessions during the monitored period was 7 (a minimum of 1 session to a maximum of 66 sessions). The median session duration during the monitored period was 12 minutes, 54 seconds (a minimum of 3 minutes, 58 seconds, to a maximum of 100 minutes, 8 seconds). The median number of EAT entries over the 14-week intervention was 7 (a minimum of 1 entry to a maximum of 314 entries). The median number of weeks that participants recorded eating experiences in the EAT was 3 (IQR 1-9) weeks. Of the 40 participants enrolled in the study, 4 women (10%) used the EAT for at least 12 weeks of their intervention period, 7 (18%) used the EAT for 7 to 11 weeks, 20 (50%) used the EAT for 1 to 6 weeks, and 9 (23%) did not use the EAT during their intervention period.11 women had limited access to “Mind, Body, Food” for more than 5 days, predominantly due to being away from home (n=8) or technical issues (n=3). Technical issues that prevented module completion included attempting to access “Mind, Body, Food” from an incompatible browser (n=3), using incorrect login details (n=1), and other issues not described (n=1). 7 women reported appetite being affected for more than 5 days (eg, due to illness) during the 14-week intervention.AcceptabilityA total of 26 women completed acceptability measures, and of these 12 had completed all modules, 10 completed 7 to 11 modules, and 4 completed 2 to 6 modules. <a href=\"#\">Table 3</a> shows that participants’ overall impression of “Mind, Body, Food” was positive. Most participants liked “Mind, Body, Food” and found the intervention useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%), easy to understand (23/25, 92%), and would recommend the program to others (21/25, 84%). Nearly 1/2 (12/25, 48%) of participants reported that “Mind, Body, Food” made it easy to learn intuitive eating skills.Of all module components, the videos were more frequently rated as being quite or extremely useful by participants compared to the audio and typed activities (<a href=\"#\">Table 3</a>). 5 out of 24 women (21%) women rated the EAT self monitoring tool as quite or extremely useful, 3 out of 19 women (16%) found email reminders to use the EAT useful, and 4 out of 12 women (33%) found SMS reminders to use the EAT useful (not shown). In regards to reminders sent to begin the next module, 17 out of 26 women (68%) rated the email reminders as quite or extremely useful. Of the women (9/24, 38%) who chose to receive SMS reminders to begin the next module, 6 (67%) rated the reminders as useful (not shown).Of the 20 women who currently owned a smartphone, 16 (80%) reported that if it were available a mobile version of “Mind, Body, Food” would be quite or extremely useful to them.Table 3User experiences of “Mind, Body, Food” (n=26).Acceptability measuresn (%)Median<strong>Overall impression</strong><br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent did you like “Mind, Body, Food?”</strong>4<br /> <br /> Disliked very much0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Disliked somewhat0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Neither liked nor disliked3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Liked somewhat10 (40)<br /> <br /> <br /> Liked very much12 (48)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent was “Mind, Body, Food” useful to you?</strong>4<br /> <br /> Not useful0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful4 (15)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful9 (35)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful11 (42)<br /> <br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent did you find “Mind, Body, Food” easy to use?</strong>4<br /> <br /> Not at all easy0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Not very easy3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat easy5 (20)<br /> <br /> <br /> Very easy12 (48)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely easy5 (20)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent did you find “Mind, Body, Food” content easy to understand?</strong>4<br /> <br /> Not at all easy0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Not very easy0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat easy2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Very easy15 (60)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely easy8 (32)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>Overall, to what extent did “Mind, Body, Food” make it easy for you to learn intuitive eating skills?</strong>3<br /> <br /> Not at all easy0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Not very easy2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat easy11 (44)<br /> <br /> <br /> Very easy9 (36)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely easy3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>Would you recommend “Mind, Body, Food” to others?</strong>5<br /> <br /> No, definitely wouldn’t0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> No, probably wouldn’t0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> Unsure4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, probably would8 (32)<br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, definitely would13 (52)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <strong>Usefulness of program features</strong><br /> <strong>How useful did you find the videos?</strong>4<br /> <br /> Not useful0 (0)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful7 (28)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful10 (40)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>How useful did you find the audio activities?</strong>3<br /> <br /> Not useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful5 (20)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful7 (28)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful7 (28)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>How useful did you find the typed activities?</strong>3<br /> <br /> Not useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful11 (44)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful4 (16)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful3 (12)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> <br /> <strong>How useful did you find the E.A.T. ?</strong>2<br /> <br /> Not useful5 (21)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful9 (38)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful5 (21)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful3 (13)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing2<br /> <br /> <strong>How useful did you find the email reminders to begin the next module?</strong>3<br /> <br /> Not useful2 (8)<br /> <br /> <br /> A little useful1 (4)<br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat useful5 (20)<br /> <br /> <br /> Quite useful9 (36)<br /> <br /> <br /> Extremely useful8 (32)<br /> <br /> <br /> Missing1<br /> Changes in Eating BehaviorThe study was not designed to detect the effects of the intervention on the outcome measures (no control group was included), but within group comparisons were performed as part of the feasibility component of the pilot study. From pre  to postintervention, there were statistically significant increases in IES-2 total scores and all 4 IES-2 subscale scores (<a href=\"#\">Table 4</a>). There was no evidence that these improvements diminished at the 3-month follow up. Based on use of the dichotomous variable (ie, binge eating vs no binge eating), 7 out of 14 women who reported eating a significantly large amount of food (ie, binge eating) at the preintervention assessment reported no binge eating at the postintervention assessment. There were no women who transitioned from no binge eating at the preintervention assessment to binge eating at the postintervention assessment or at the 3-month follow up; 4 women who reported binge eating at postintervention no longer reported binge eating at the 3-month follow up. McNemar’s test revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of women binge eating from the pre  to postintervention visits (<em>P</em>=.01) and a significant decrease from postintervention to follow up (<em>P</em>&lt;.001). The median days women who were categorized as binge eaters reported binge eating at preintervention was 4.25 (IQR 2.5-10) days, at postintervention was 4 (IQR 2-8) days, and at the 3-month follow up it was 2 (IQR 2-4) days. A Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test was used to examine changes in the reported number of days women were unable to prevent or stop episodes of eating an unusually large amount of food and revealed a significant decrease from pre  to postintervention (<em>P</em>=.03) and no evidence of a change from postintervention to follow up (<em>P</em>=.57).Psychological Inflexibility, Quality of Life, and BMIPsychological inflexibility decreased significantly from pre  to postintervention (mean change −4.23 [SD 7.13], <em>P</em>=.006), and there was a tendency for a further decrease in psychological inflexibility from postintervention to 3-month follow up (mean change −2.60 [SD 6.58], <em>P</em>=.06) (<a href=\"#\">Table 4</a>). There were no significant changes in general physical health from pre  to postintervention (pre  to postintervention PCS scores: mean change 0.29 [SD 9.35], <em>P</em>=.88; postintervention to 3-month follow up PCS scores: mean change 1.26 [SD 10.46], <em>P</em>=.55). However, general mental health improved significantly from pre  to postintervention with a further improvement postintervention to 3-month follow up (mean change 5.07 [SD 6.31], <em>P</em>&lt;.001; mean change 3.45 [SD 7.71], <em>P</em>=.03, respectively). There were no statistically significant changes in BMI from pre  to postintervention or postintervention to 3-month follow up (mean change −0.13 [SD 0.88], <em>P</em>=.46 and mean change −0.01 [SD 0.57], <em>P</em>=.93, respectively).Associations Between Changes in Intuitive Eating With BMI and Psychological InflexibilitySpearman correlations showed a statistically significant inverse relationship between pre  to postintervention change in total intuitive eating scores and pre  to postintervention change in BMI (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.43, <em>P</em>=.03). However, when relationships with individual subscales were examined, a significant association was found for only 1 subscale: greater decreases in BMI were associated with greater increases in eating for physical rather than emotional reasons (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.56, <em>P</em>=.003). There was also a statistically significant inverse relationship between change in psychological inflexibility scores and change in intuitive eating scores (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.52, <em>P</em>=.006); that is, greater improvements in psychological flexibility were associated with greater increases in total intuitive eating scores. Furthermore, larger improvements in psychological flexibility were associated with greater increases in 2 subscale scores: eating for physical rather than emotional reasons (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.41, <em>P</em>=.04) and reliance on hunger and satiety cues (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>=−.62, <em>P</em>&lt;.001). A greater reduction in psychological inflexibility scores was also associated with a greater decrease in BMI (<em>r</em>=.41, <em>P</em>=.04).Table 4Changes from pre  (n=26) to postintervention (n=26) and from postintervention to 3-month follow up (n=25).CharacteristicMean (SD)Change (SD)<sup>a</sup>95% CI<em>P</em> value<sup>b</sup>IES-2<sup>c</sup> total<br /> Preintervention2.54 (0.58)———<br /> Postintervention3.45 (.55)0.94 (0.67)0.67, 1.21&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow up3.53 (.61)0.08 (0.55)−0.15, 0.31.47UPE<sup>d</sup><br /> Preintervention3.07 (0.73)———<br /> Postintervention3.56 (.54)0.52 (0.87)0.17, 0.87.01<br /> 3-month follow up3.47 (.58)−0.09 (0.64)−0.36, 0.17.76EPR<sup>e</sup><br /> Preintervention2.19 (0.96)———<br /> Postintervention3.21 (.89)1.08 (0.96)0.69, 1.46&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow up3.49 (.88)0.28 (0.89)−0.09, 0.65.13RHS<sup>f</sup><br /> Preintervention2.33 (0.77)———<br /> Postintervention3.58 (.76)1.28 (0.98)0.89, 1.68&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow up3.55 (.81)−0.03 (0.68)−0.31, 0.25.81B FCC<sup>g</sup><br /> Preintervention2.87 (0.61)———<br /> Postintervention3.59 (.81)0.74 (0.61)0.50, 1.00&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow up3.72 (.72)0.13 (0.87)−0.23, 0.49.45BMI<sup>h</sup> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)<br /> Preintervention32.93 (4.85)———<br /> Postintervention32.81 (5.31)−0.13 (0.88)−0.48, 0.23.46<br /> 3-month follow up<sup>i</sup>32.80 (5.29)−0.01 (0.57)−0.28, 0.26.93AAQ II<sup>j</sup><br /> Preintervention22.46 (8.67)———<br /> Postintervention18.23 (8.14)−4.23 (7.13)−7.11, -1.35.006<br /> 3-month follow up16.08 (7.73)−2.60 (6.58)−5.32, 0.16.06SF-12v2 PCS<sup>k</sup><br /> Preintervention50.46 (7.83)———<br /> Postintervention50.87 (11.02)0.29 (9.35)−3.49, 4.06.88<br /> 3-month follow up52.13 (6.78)1.26 (10.46)−3.06, 5.58.55SF-12v2 MCS<sup>l</sup><br /> Preintervention45.63 (6.31)———<br /> Postintervention50.24 (7.41)5.07 (6.31)2.52, 7.61&lt;.001<br /> 3-month follow up53.70 (4.99)3.45 (7.71)0.27, 6.63.03<a href=\"#fn15\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref15\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>15</sup></a><a href=\"#fn16\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref16\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>16</sup></a><a href=\"#fn17\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref17\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>17</sup></a><a href=\"#fn18\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref18\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>18</sup></a><a href=\"#fn19\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref19\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>19</sup></a><a href=\"#fn20\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref20\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>20</sup></a><a href=\"#fn21\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref21\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>21</sup></a><a href=\"#fn22\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref22\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>22</sup></a><a href=\"#fn23\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref23\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>23</sup></a><a href=\"#fn24\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref24\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>24</sup></a><a href=\"#fn25\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref25\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>25</sup></a><a href=\"#fn26\" class=\"footnote ref\" id=\"fnref26\" role=\"doc noteref\"><sup>26</sup></a>alic&gt;

      "## Methods Patients with active RA (N = 982) were randomized 2:2:1 to subcutaneous CZP (400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4; followed by CZP 200 mg or 400 mg) plus methotrexate (MTX) every other week, or placebo (PBO) plus MTX. ## Results Patients treated with CZP plus MTX reported significant (*P* < 0.001), clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL at the 1st assessment (week 12); reductions in fatigue, disease activity and pain and improvements in physical function were reported at week 1. Mean changes from baseline in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) at week 52 for CZP 200 mg and 400 mg plus MTX, and PBO plus MTX were 6.4, 6.4 and 2.1, respectively (*P* < 0.001). Changes in SF-36 MCS scores had the lowest correlation with disease activity scores (DAS28) and American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement (ACR20) response rates, while improvements in pain showed the highest correlation. ## Conclusions Treatment with CZP plus MTX resulted in rapid and sustained improvements in all PROs, indicating that the benefits of CZP extend beyond clinical efficacy endpoints into areas that are more relevant and meaningful for patients on 1 daily basis. ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00152386. # Results ## Patients A total of 982 patients were randomized in RAPID 1: 393 to CZP 200 mg plus MTX, 390 to CZP 400 mg plus MTX, and 199 to PBO plus MTX. Of these, 255 (64.9%), 274 (70.3%) and 43 (21.6%) completed 52 weeks of treatment, respectively [[28](#)]. At baseline, 82% of patients were female, with mean age 52 years, 77% rheumatoid factor positive, mean disease duration 6.2 years, and having failed a mean of 1.4 disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; excluding MTX). The burden of RA at baseline was significant, as evidenced by patient reported global assessment of disease activity, pain, physical function, and fatigue scores (Table [1](#)). In particular, SF-36 domain scores at baseline were markedly lower than age  and gender matched US population norms, and SF-36 MCS and PCS scores reflected a significant psychological burden as well as physical impairments.table wrap\n",

By the end of the study at week 52, mean scores were 1.1 for both CZP plus MTX treatment groups, respectively, compared with baseline scores of 1.7. Significantly more CZP plus MTX treated patients than PBO plus MTX treated patients reported HAQ DI improvements equal to or greater than the MCID throughout the trial (*P* < 0.001). CZP treated patients also reported statistically significant improvements in physical function that met or exceeded MCID as reported above for SF-36 PCS (Figure [1a](#)) and Physical Functioning domain scores (Table [2](#)). CZP treated patients reported significant improvements from baseline in pain VAS (Figure [3c](#)) and patient's global assessment of disease activity (Figure [3d](#); *P* < 0.001), evident at week 1 and sustained through week 52.

Results were similar regardless of CZP dose (200 mg or 400 mg). ## Comparison of patient reported outcomes with DAS28 and ACR20 response rates To explore the relation between the patient reported outcomes and the physician reported assessments of disease, PRO responses (as defined by improvements in physical function, pain, fatigue and SF-36 scores equal to or greater than the MCIDs) were compared with DAS28 responses (defined as a decrease from baseline of ≥ 1.2) and ACR20 response rates at week 52. In general, PRO responses were in agreement with clinical responses as determined by either improvements in RA signs and symptoms (ACR20 response rates) or decrease in disease activity (DAS28 scores; Table [3](#)). As expected, classification of response according to physical function and pain was highly correlated with ACR20 response rates, with 88.8% and 93.6% of patients treated with CZP 200 mg plus MTX being classified the same by physical function/ACR20 and pain/ACR20, respectively. Correlations between fatigue and ACR20 responses were also high (90.0%) as were those between patient's global assessment of disease activity (98.0%), while changes in HRQoL (SF-36 PCS and MCS scores) had the lowest correlation with ACR20 responses (84.3% and 77.4%, respectively).table wrap\n",

      "The objectives of this study are to assess the therapeutic effects and complications of regional brain cooling in severe head injury with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) 6-7. ## Materials and Methods: 1 prospective randomized controlled pilot study involving patients with severe traumatic brain injury with GCS 6 and 7 who required decompressive craniectomy. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: Cooling and no cooling. Brain was cooled by irrigating the brain continuously with cold Hartmann solution for 24-48 h. Main outcome assessments were a dichotomized Glasgow outcome score (GOS) at 6 months posttrauma. ## Results: A total of 32 patients were recruited. There were 63.2% of patients in cooling group attained good GOS at 6 months compared to only 15.4% in noncooling group (*P* = 0.007). Interestingly, the analysis at 6 months post trauma disclosed mild cooling treated patients did better than no cooling (70% vs. 15.4% attained good GOS, *P* = 0.013) and apparently, the deep cooling treated patients failed to be better than either no cooling (*P* = 0.074) or mild cooling group (*P* = 0.650). # Results ## Demographic and clinical characteristics A total of 32 patients were recruited into the 2 years study period from 1^st^ January 2010 to 1^st^ January 2012, aged between 14 and 74 years old. Of these, 5 patients aged more than 60 years old (19.2%). There were 27 (84.4%) males and 5 (15.6%) females. Patients were randomized into 2 groups; cooling group consisted of 19 patients (59.4%) and no cooling group consisted of 13 patients (40.6%). Finally, further stratification of cooling group based on the temperature of infused solution created 3 analyzable groups; mild cooling consisted of 10 patients (31.3%), deep cooling of 9 patients (28.1%) and no cooling of 13 patients (40.6%). The mean ages of the recruited patients were 28.9, 26.7 and 45.5 years old for the mild cooling, deep cooling and no cooling groups, respectively. 15 patients were admitted with GCS of 6 (46.9%) and 17 patients with GCS of 7 (53.1%). Among these, 28 patients (87.5%) underwent unilateral decompresive craniectomy, while 4 patients had bifrontal decompressive craniectomy (12.5%). [Table 1](#) illustrates those parameters where all groups were comparable with non statistical difference shown for gender, GCS, ISS, Marshall score and clotting profiles. Age was the only basic parameters that differed among the 3 studied groups (*P* = 0.02). Even though the highest mean age was found in the control group, the 95% CIs (95% CI) for all 3 groups were still within the age of <60 years old.table wrap\n",

There were 63.2% of patients (12 patients) in cooling group attained good GOS at 6 months compared with only 15.4% in non cooling group (2 patients). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups when outcomes analysis was made at time of discharge.

Cooling the severely injured brain which had underwent decompressive craniectomy did not reduce the ICP further, but instead shown marked improvements in CPP and Licox PtiO~2~ after 12 h of cooling. [Figure 2](#) discloses mean IC*P* values and patterns for the 3 studied groups. All ICP readings stayed below 25 mmHg, and marked fluctuations were noted in cooling groups. Figures [3](#) and [4](#) reveal mean values and trends for CPP and Licox PtiO~2~, respectively. Mild cooling group had ascending trends of CPP with mean values above 60 mmHg but <75 mmHg together with PtiO~2~ mean values of above 40 mmHg after 12 h of cooling therapy. Interestingly, the deep cooling group did have similar ascending trends for CPP and PtiO~2~ but their mean values after 12 h of cooling therapy were above 75 mmHg and <30 mmHg, respectively. [Figure 5](#) gives additional information on brain body (axillary) temperature gradient and types of cooling therapy.

Trend analysis of 7 patients in mild cooling and 8 patients in deep cooling showed obvious decrements in values for both, T cell markers and pro inflammatory cytokines after cooling therapy. Intriguingly, markers for pro inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF) did show more marked decrement than markers for T cell [[Table 4](#)]. Despite of marked decrement in most studied immunological biomarkers after cooling therapy, the Wilcoxon Signed Ranked test for 2 related samples disclosed insignificant difference between pre  and post cooling for all immunological parameters. ## Correlation between studied parameters with Glasgow outcome score at 6 months post trauma Correlation analysis using Spearman rank correlation coefficient discloses age (*r* = 0.46) and Licox brain oxygenation (*r* = 0.40) as the only 2 studied parameters that reasonably correlated with outco]me score at 6 months post trauma.

      "# Abstract # Abstract ***Objectives:*** To evaluate the short term efficacy and safety of desvenlafaxine (25--50 mg/d) compared with placebo in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). ***Methods:*** Outpatient children (7--11 years) and adolescents (12--17 years) who met DSM IV TR criteria for MDD and had screening and baseline Children's Depression Rating Scale -Revised (CDRS R) total scores >40 were randomly assigned to 8-week treatment with placebo, desvenlafaxine (25, 35, or 50 mg/d based on baseline weight), or fluoxetine (20 mg/d). The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in CDRS R total score at week 8, analyzed using 1 mixed effects model for repeated measures. Secondary efficacy endpoints included week 8 Clinical Global Impressions -Severity, Clinical Global Impressions -Improvement (CGI I), and response (CGI I ≤ 2). ***Results:*** The safety population included 339 patients (children, *n* = 130; adolescents, *n* = 209). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in CDRS R total score at week 8, did not statistically separate from placebo, for either desvenlafaxine (adjusted mean [standard error] change, −22.6 [1.17]) or fluoxetine (−24.8 [1.17]; placebo, −23.1 [1.18]). Week 8 CGI I response rates were significantly greater for fluoxetine (78.2%; *p* = 0.017) than for placebo (62.6%); desvenlafaxine (68.7%) did not differ from placebo. Other secondary outcomes were consistent with those obtained with CDRS R. Rates of treatment emergent adverse events were comparable among treatment groups (desvenlafaxine, 60.0%; placebo, 70.5%; and fluoxetine, 64.3%). Desvenlafaxine 25--50 mg/d was generally safe and well tolerated in children and adolescents in this study. # Results ## Study population A total of 340 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 339 patients (children, *n* = 130; adolescents, *n* = 209) were included in the safety population (desvenlafaxine, *n* = 115; fluoxetine, *n* = 112; placebo, *n* = 112). The ITT population included 130 children and 207 adolescents. A total of 42 (12%) patients discontinued early (desvenlafaxine, 16 [14%]; fluoxetine, 13 [12%]; and placebo, 13 [12%]). 1](#)). <sup>a</sup>1 patient was screened and, although not randomized, received a total of 8 blinded placebo doses. The patient was discontinued after the week 1 visit once the error was identified and listed as a protocol violation.</figcaption> </figure> Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable among treatment groups for both children and adolescents ([Table 1](#)). Mean (SD) CDRS R Total Score at baseline was 56.5 (8.9), mean (SD) CGI S score was 4.5 (0.6), and the duration of the most recent depressive episode ranged from 1 to 96 months (median, 7; mean [SD], 13.4 [15.1]). Overall, 30.4% (103) of patients in the safety population had a prior or active psychiatric condition other than MDD in their medical history (desvenlafaxine, 31.3%; fluoxetine, 25.9%; and placebo, 33.9%). The most common psychiatric conditions (reported by ≥2% of patients) included attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (desvenlafaxine, 12.2%; fluoxetine, 13.4%; and placebo, 5.4%), nonsuicidal self injurious behavior (desvenlafaxine, 7.0%; fluoxetine, 8.0%; and placebo, 12.5%), insomnia (desvenlafaxine, 7.0%; fluoxetine, 6.3%; and placebo, 8.0%), generalized anxiety disorder (desvenlafaxine, 0.9%; fluoxetine, 6.3%; and placebo, 0), and oppositional defiant disorder (desvenlafaxine, 3.5%; fluoxetine, 3.6%; and placebo, 0).table wrap\n",

AEs considered by the investigator to be related to study medication were reported by 31.9% of patients (desvenlafaxine, 28.7%; fluoxetine, 32.1%; and placebo, 34.8%). Severe AEs (those that interfered significantly with patients' usual function) considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study medication were reported by 3.5% of patients (desvenlafaxine, 1.7%; fluoxetine, 5.4%; and placebo, 3.6%). In 3 patients, severe AEs were considered related to study medication: 1 desvenlafaxine treated patient reported severe pruritus and severe macular rash and discontinued treatment. 1 placebo treated patient reported severe agitation and severe anger, and a 2nd reported severe insomnia; neither was discontinued due to those AEs. 5 adolescents (0 children) discontinued due to AEs, 2 each from the desvenlafaxine (disinhibition; macular rash and pruritus) and placebo (vomiting; headache) groups and 1 from the fluoxetine group (suicidal ideation). ### Treatment emergent adverse events Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by more than 10% of patients in any group were headache, upper abdominal pain, and nausea. [Table 3](#) shows the most frequent (≥5% in any group) TEAEs by age group, and overall.

Upon review of patient data by the medical monitor, 8 patients (all adolescents) were deemed to have clinically important vital sign results: postural hypotension in 3 desvenlafaxine treated patients (35-, 35-, and 50-mg/d doses) and in 4 fluoxetine treated patients, and increased supine systolic blood pressure in 1 desvenlafaxine treated patient (122--126 mm Hg at weeks 3--6; baseline, 117 mm Hg). Mean changes from baseline in BMI, blood pressure, and pulse measurements are reported by age group in [Supplementary Table S5](#). Clinically important ECG findings were reported for 1 patient assigned to fluoxetine who had Wolff -Parkinson -White syndrome at study entry, with no change over the course of the study. The frequencies of on therapy PCI laboratory findings are presented in [Supplementary Table S6](#). Findings in 9 patients (4 desvenlafaxine, 5 fluoxetine) were determined to be clinically important: 3 had elevated triglycerides (2 desvenlafaxine, 1 fluoxetine), 1 high prolactin (desvenlafaxine), 1 low hematocrit and low hemoglobin (desvenlafaxine), 3 positive urine protein (fluoxetine), and 1 abnormal liver function test (fluoxetine). Mean changes from baseline for selected laboratory values are reported by age group and treatment in [Supplementary Table S7](#).\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background The purpose of the present study was to compare the image quality of spinal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed on 1 high field horizontal open versus a short bore MR scanner in a randomized controlled study setup. ## Methods Altogether, 93 (80% women, mean age 53) consecutive patients underwent spine imaging after random assignement to a 1-T horizontal open MR scanner with a vertical magnetic field or a 1.5-T short bore MR scanner. Regarding all sequences, the relative differences were 39% for the mean overall qualitative image quality, 53% for the mean SNR values, and 34--37% for the quantitative contour sharpness (*P*<0.0001). Scanning times were significantly longer for examinations performed on the open MR scanner (mean: 32±22 min versus 20±9 min; *P*<0.0001). ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT00715806](#) # Results ## Participants Of 174 enrolled patients, 106 had a clinical indication for MR imaging of the spine: 35 cervicothoracic spine, 61 thoracolumbar spine, 10 whole spine. Of these 106 patients, 93 underwent MR imaging, and all were included in this analysis ([Figure 1](#)). [Table 1](#) lists the baseline characteristics of the patients included. 80 percent of the patients were women who have been shown to be more likely to suffer from claustrophobia [[8]](#). The mean age was 53 (SD, 12; range, 27-88), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 29 (SD, 7.5; range, 17.5--52). The mean CLQ score was 2,35 (SD, 0.69) which is in accordance with other high risk groups [[16]](#). Moreover, 50.5% of the 93 patients had prior MR imaging which was prevented, aborted or performed with sedation due to claustrophobia. Indications for MR imaging included: radicular pain (n = 60), (non motor) neurologic symptoms and/or deficits (n = 60), motor deficits (n = 28), history of prior surgery (n = 10), cauda equina syndrome (n = 4), suspicion of cancer (n = 3), and history of previous trauma (n = 2). Some patients had more than 1 clinical indication for MR imaging. All indications were appropriate according to American College of Radiology guidelines [[8]](#), [[19]](#), [[20]](#).table wrap\n",

Only 1 patient aborted MR imaging on the 1st scanner due to claustrophobia after 1 sequence, which was thus not included in the primary analysis. The other patients who were imaged after cross referral rejected MR imaging on the first scanner before the examination had started ([Figure 1](#)). Details of the MR imaging characteristics are listed in [Table 2](#). Scanning times were significantly longer for open MR imaging and the perceived noise and pain levels were also higher, although statistically not significant, in patients who were examined with the open MR scanner [[8]](#).table wrap\n",

Thus image quality scores ranged from 1 (optimal) to 4 (poor). [Table 3](#) shows the respective results computed separately for all qualitative parameters which were assessed. There were significantly more artifacts in sagittal T1-weighted sequences of the cervicothoracic and the thoracolumbar spine and in axial T2-weighted sequences of the thoracolumbar spine when obtained with the open MR scanner. Subgroup analyses excluding patients who underwent imaging after cross referral revealed equally distributed results (*P*<0.0001, data not shown).

      "## Objective This community wide trial evaluated 1 text message (short message service, SMS) delivered, extended contact intervention ('Get Healthy, Stay Healthy' (GHSH)), which followed on from a population level, behavioral telephone coaching program. Participants (n=228) were recruited after completing a 6-month lifestyle telephone coaching program: mean age = 53.4 (standard deviation (SD)=12.3) years; 66.7% (152/228) female; mean body mass index (BMI) upon entering GHSH=29.5 kg/m2 (SD = 6.0). Participants received tailored text messages over a 6-month period. The message frequency, timing, and content of the messages was based on participant preference, ascertained during 2 tailoring telephone calls. Primary outcomes of body weight, waist circumference, physical activity (walking, moderate, and vigorous sessions/week), and dietary behaviors (fruit and vegetable serves/day, cups of sweetened drinks per day, takeaway meals per week; fat, fiber and total indices from the Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire) were assessed via self report before (baseline) and after (6-months) extended contact (with moderate vigorous physical activity (MVPA) also assessed via accelerometry). ## Results Significant intervention effects, all favoring the intervention group, were observed at 6-months for change in weight (-1.35 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.24, -0.46, *P*=.003), weekly moderate physical activity sessions (0.56 sessions/week, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.96, *P*=.008) and accelerometer assessed MVPA (24.16 minutes/week, 95% CI: 5.07, 43.25, *P*=.007). # Results ## Participants There were 1071 clients invited to participate in this study, of whom 300 expressed verbal interest in participating in the trial, and 228 participants consented and were randomized (228/300, 76%; [Figure 1](#)). [Table 1](#) shows the demographic characteristics of GHSH participants (intervention, n=114; control, n=114). Upon entering the GHSH trial, participants (152/228, 67% female) had a mean age of 53.4 (standard deviation (SD) = 12.3) years and BMI of 29.5 kg/m^2^(SD = 6.0), 34% (78/228) were overweight and 38% (87/228) were obese, 40% (91/228) did not meet physical activity guidelines [[28](#)] (ie, <150 minutes MVPA per week), and 80% (182/228) did not consume the recommended serves of fruit (ie, 2) and/or vegetables (ie, 5) per day [[29](#)].The GHSH sample was not representative of all participants completing the final GHS coaching call. Odds of being in the GHSH trial were significantly higher than their respective counterparts for those: aged <60 years; not working; without a post school qualification; self reported diagnosis of hypertension; self reported diagnosis of high cholesterol; doing no vigorous activity; and, who consume <1 takeaway meal per week ([Multimedia Appendix 2](#)). The overall retention rate from baseline to 6 months was 95% (216/228) (103/114, 90% in intervention and 113/114, 99% in controls, *P*=.005). Most intervention participants (98/114, 86%) and controls (107/114, 94%) had full data on all outcomes at 6-month follow up and on the baseline and prestudy covariates examined ( *P*=.077).:::\n",

      "*t* test. 32.7 ± 7.3 vs 29.1 ± 5.8 kg/m^2^, *P*=.006); higher baseline weight (90.8 ± 19.5 vs 82.3 ± 18.9 kg, *P*=.044); higher rates of Type 2 Diabetes at baseline (8/23, 34.8% vs 22/205, 10.7%, *P*=.004); higher rates of smoking at baseline (5/23, 21.7% vs 7/205, 3.4%, *P*=.003); and lower vegetable intake at baseline (2.5 ± 1.1 vs 3.4 ± 1.6 servings per day, *P*=.012) ([Multimedia Appendix 3](#)). Participant's reasons for discontinuing the intervention are shown in [Figure 1](#), with the most common reasons being that they were too busy (4/13) or that the intervention was not working for them (4/13). ## Anthropometric and Behavior Change Results ### Anthropometric Outcomes Intervention participants showed significant reductions in both body weight (−0.89 kg, 95% CI: −1.53, −0.25) and waist circumference (−1.34 cm, 95% CI: −2.31, −0.36; [Table 2](#)). Intervention group improvements were significantly greater than controls for weight loss (−1.35 kg, 95% CI: −2.24, −0.46, *P*=.003), but not for waist circumference ( *P*=.115; [Table 3](#)). ### Physical Activity The intervention group maintained their accelerometer assessed MVPA and self reported vigorous activity, and changed significantly only in self reported walking (−0.55, 95% CI: −0.99, −0.11 sessions/week; [Table 2](#)). The control group changed significantly in moderate activity and MVPA, which both declined (−0.68, 95% CI: −1.11, -0.26 sessions/week, and −16.10, 95% CI −28.60, −3.61 min/week; [Table 2](#)). The intervention group did significantly better than the control group in moderate activity (0.56, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.96 sessions/week) and in accelerometer assessed MVPA (24.16, 95% CI: 5.07, 43.25 min/week; [Table 3](#)). Intervention effects for walking and vigorous activity were not significant ([Table 3](#)). ### Dietary Behaviors In the intervention group, small, but statistically significant improvements in dietary outcomes were observed for the FFBQ Fiber and Total Indices, while remaining dietary outcomes, except takeaway meals per week, were all maintained ([Table 2](#)). By contrast, in the control group, there were no statistically significant improvements, only statistically significant declines in vegetable intake and fruit intake ([Table 2](#)). ### Sensitivity Analyses Results from analyses using multiple imputation mostly supported the interpretations from the main analyses ([Multimedia Appendix 4](#)), except that due to slightly narrower CIs in the multiple imputation analysis, the intervention group maintained takeaway meals/week (rather than being 'inconclusive') and the intervention effect for vegetable serves/day was 'similar' (rather than 'inconclusive'). Conclusions using the alternative models mostly supported the main findings ([Multimedia Appendix 5](#)) and revealed significant differences in walking ( *P*=.018). The intervention group showed a greater tendency to walk than controls (odds ratio = 2.17, 95% CI: 0.45, 10.43, *P*=.334), but also to report fewer walking sessions when they did walk than controls (relative rate = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.92, *P*=.005). ## Feasibility Results The mean (±SD) call duration was 34 ±8 minutes for the initial tailoring call and 18 ±8 minutes for the 12-week tailoring call. The median number of text messages requested during the initial tailoring call and at the 12-week tailoring call were both 5 per fortnight (25^th^-75^th^percentiles =3-7 texts). During the initial tailoring call, 40% (46/111) of participants requested fortnightly goal checks for both behavioral goals; 35% (40/111) weekly for both goals; and, 22%(25/111) weekly for 1 goal and fortnightly for the other goal. Approximately 1/2 the participants (58/111, 52%) did not request any real time behavioral prompts and 35% (39/111) requested between 2-4 prompts per fortnight. Almost all (89/95, 94%) intervention participants still enrolled at 12-weeks completed the 12-week tailoring interview. During the 12-week tailoring call, almost all (82/89, 92%) participants changed their preference for text message content, and 40% (36/89) changed their preferred text message schedule. Outside of the 12-week tailoring call, only 3% (3/90) of participants changed either of these preferences via text. The weight goal reset text received replies from 30% (33/111) of participants at week 6 and 26% (25/95) at week 18. At week 6, 40% (44/111) of participants reset at least 1 behavioral goal; 29% (28/95) did so in week 18. Intervention completers (n=90) replied to 84% of goal check texts sent in week 1 (152/180) and 69% (125/180) of goal check texts sent in the last week. ## Acceptability Results Most (69/99, 70%) participants rated GHSH as \"useful\" or \"extremely useful\" in supporting their weight goal, and 75% (74/99) reported that they were \"satisfied\" or \"extremely satisfied\" with the intervention. Follow up interviews with 62 intervention participants revealed that: experience with text messaging prior to GHSH impacted on participants' experience during the intervention; the GHSH program often exceeded participants' expectations; and participants generally perceived the GHS and GHSH intervention to be 1 program. ## Costs of Intervention Delivery Results Health coach staff spent, on average, 35 minutes per participant conducting and preparing for the initial tailoring interview and 30 minutes for the 12-week tailoring interview. Research staff spent on average 31 minutes per participant entering tailoring data into the software following the initial tailoring call and 15 minutes per participant after the 12-week tailoring call. Research staff had to manually trigger responses to 813 goal check replies not recognized by the software (813/2071, 39%) of responses received), which took approximately 1 minute per response. During the intervention, 8518 text messages were sent to participants (at AU$0.15 each) totaling AU$1278 (averaging AU$11.21 per participant). Overall, it cost approximately AU$80.00 per participant to deliver the GHSH extended contact intervention.table wrap\n",

      "The Internet shopping process offers 1 novel opportunity for the modification of dietary patterns. ## Participants: The participants were consumers using a commercial online Internet shopping site between February and June 2004. ## Outcome Measures: The outcome measure was the difference in saturated fat (grams per 100 g of food) in shopping baskets between the intervention and control groups. ## Results: There were 497 randomised participants, mean age 40 y, each shopping for an average of about 3 people. The amount of saturated fat in the foods purchased by the intervention group was 0.66% lower (95% confidence interval 0.48--0.84, *p* < 0.001) than in the control group. # RESULTS ## Participants A total of 4,548 individuals were offered participation, and 497 were randomised (251 intervention and 246 control) ([Figure 1](#)). Of these, 456 (224 intervention and 232 control) completed at least 1 episode of shopping that included 1 or more of the 524 foods studied. Median follow up time completed by the end of the study in June 2004 was 35 d, and the median number of shopping episodes done by participants was 3 (range 1--20). The baseline characteristics documented on the questionnaire were balanced between randomised groups, with a mean participant age of 40 y and a proportion female of 88% ([Table 1](#)). ## Outcomes and Estimation For the 1st occasion on which advice was offered, the amount of saturated fat in the food purchased by the intervention group after advice was a mean of 0.66% (0.48--0.84, *p <* 0.001) lower than in the corresponding foods purchased by the control group ([Table 2](#)), which is equivalent to an approximate 10% reduction in saturated fat content of foods purchased ([Figure 2](#)). This difference resulted from a decrease in the mean saturated fat content in the foods purchased following the advice offered to the intervention group of 0.77% (0.60--0.94, *p <* 0.001), with no corresponding decrease in the control group 0.04% (0.00--0.08, *p =* 0.07). The effect estimate for the primary outcome was 0.62% (0.46--0.79, *p <* 0.001) if analysis was restricted to only the 456 individuals that selected 1 of the 524 foods studied and was 0.58 (0.39--0.77, *p <* 0.001) if the change in saturated fat was set to 0 for those individuals that did not select 1 of the foods. The subgroup analyses provided some evidence that the intervention had greater effects among individuals with higher body mass index and among people above 40 y of age (for both, homogeneity *p* < 0.03) ([Table 3](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Effects of Repeated Advice in the Intervention (<em>n =</em> 115) and Control Group (<em>n =</em> 121)<br /> Squares are placed at the point estimate of the effect observed in the intervention (A) and control (B) groups, and the vertical lines extend to the 95% confidence intervals around the estimate. There was no significant decrease in saturated fat at any time point in the control group, nor any trend over time (all <em>p</em> &gt; 0.09).</figcaption> </figure>The mean cost per 100 g of the foods purchased by the intervention group was not different from that in the control group (intervention AUD$0.63 [0.58--0.68]1/100 g versus control AUD$0.62 [0.58--0.67]1/100 g, *p =* 0.19). ## Ancillary Analyses The effects of the intervention over repeated episodes of shopping were explored amongst the 115 participants that completed 6 shopping episodes during the study. These analyses demonstrated that for the intervention group the magnitude of the reduction in saturated fat achieved was greater in earlier compared to later shopping episodes (for trend, *p* = 0.01) ([Figure 2](#)) and showed that there was no effect of the control condition on saturated fat during any shopping episode (*p* > 0.09 for all 6 shopping episodes in the control group).\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background Rocuronium has been well known to produce withdrawal response in 50-80% patients when administered intravenously. ## Methods 1 total of 120 patients undergoing various elective surgeries were enrolled. Patients were allocated into 4 groups according to the pretreatment drugs (Group N, normal saline; Groups L, lidocaine 40 mg; Group K, ketamine 0.5 mg/kg; Group R, remifentanil 1 µg/kg). Patients received drugs prepared by dilution to 3 ml volume before injection of rocuronium. Withdrawal responses after injection of rocuronium were graded on a 4-point scale. ## Results Incidence of withdrawal response was significantly lower in group L (20%), group K (30%), and group R (0%), than group N (87%). Severe withdrawal response was observed in 5 of the 30 patients (17%) in group L, and in 9 of the 30 patients (30%) in group K. There was no severe withdrawal response in group R. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were significantly decreased in group R compared to other groups. ## Conclusions It seems that remifentanil (1 µg/kg intravenously) was the strongest and most effective in prevention of withdrawal response after rocuronium injection among the 3 drugs. # Results There were no dropouts and the data from all 120 patients could be analyzed. There were no significant differences among the groups in demographic data ([Table 1](#)). The incidence of withdrawal response was 87% (26/30), 20% (6/30), 30% (9/30), and 0% in group N, group L, group K, and group R, respectively ([Table 2](#)). Severe withdrawal response which is >2 on the 4-point scale occurred in 25 patients (84%) in group N (P < 0.00833). However, it was observed in 5 patients (17%) in group L, in 9 patients (30%) in group K, and in no patient in group R, respectively. The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) to prevent pain in 1 who would have had pain was 1.49, 1.75, and 1.15 in group L, group K, and group R, respectively. Lidocaine (40 mg), ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), or remifentanil (1 µg/kg) decreased the withdrawal response significantly and remifentanil (1 µg/kg) was the most effective in the prevention of withdrawal response among the drugs (P < 0.00833) ([Table 2](#)). 1](#) and [2](#)). 1](#) and [2](#)). 1](#)). However, in group R, mean blood pressure was significantly lower compared to other groups (P < 0.05) ([Fig. 1](#)).

      "# Abstract We evaluated the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents (6--17 years) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 1 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled 8-week study in Japan. Patients received flexibly dosed aripiprazole (1--15 mg/day) or placebo. 92 patients were randomized to placebo (n = 45) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent/caregiver rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8. Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician rated Clinical Global Impression Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8. 3 patients in placebo group discontinued. # Results ## Subject Disposition and Demographics In total, 99 patients were enrolled and 92 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 45) or aripiprazole (n = 47). 42 (93.3%) patients in the placebo group and 47 (100%) patients in the aripiprazole group completed the trial; subject disposition is shown in Fig. [1](#) . All randomized patients (n = 92) were included the efficacy and safety sample. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Subject disposition</figcaption> </figure> The demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline are shown in Table  [1](#) .

It ranged from 8.1 to 8.4 mg after day 43, at which time the dose was fixed for each patient, with a mean (±SD) daily dose of 8.2 ± 4.9 mg at endpoint. The last dose of aripiprazole (n = 47) was distributed as follows: 1 mg/day, n = 2 (4.3%); 3 mg/day, n = 13 (27.7%); 6 mg/day, n = 8 (17.0%); 9 mg/day, n = 9 (19.1%); 12 mg/day, n = 3 (6.4%); and 15 mg/day, n = 12 (25.5%) (Fig. [2](#) ). The mean daily dose of placebo corresponding to aripiprazole was 8.1 ± 2.0 mg (±SD) during the treatment phase. The mean (± SD) daily dose of placebo at endpoint was 12.8 ± 3.6 mg and the prescription pattern of the last dose of placebo corresponding to aripiprazole (n = 45) was distributed as follows: 1 mg/day, n = 1 (2.2%); 3 mg/day, n = 1 (2.2%); 6 mg/day, n = 2 (4.4%); 9 mg/day, n = 7 (15.6%); 12 mg/day, n = 5 (11.1%); and 15 mg/day, n = 29 (64.4%) (Fig. [2](#) ). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Patient distribution of the last doses of aripiprazole and placebo corresponding to aripiprazole</figcaption> </figure> Hypnotic/sedative/anxiolytic agents [placebo n = 0 (0%); aripiprazole n = 2 (4.3%)] were used concomitantly during the study. ## Efficacy Outcomes Table  [2](#) shows the results for primary and secondary endpoints. At week 8, the least square mean decrease from baseline in the parent/caregiver rated ABC J irritability subscale score was significantly greater for patients who received aripiprazole (Table  [2](#) ; Fig. [3](#) ). The TD was −3.94 showing statistical significance (Table  [2](#) ). Significant TDs in favor of aripiprazole were detected from week 3 through week 8 (Fig. [3](#) ). At week 8, aripiprazole group showed a statistically significant improvement in mean clinician rated CGI I scores greater than the placebo group [2.7 (0.1) vs 3.4 (0.1); TD: −0.62 (95% CI: −1.02 to − 0.22); p = 0.003]. Significant TDs in favor of aripiprazole were observed from week 2 through week 8 (Fig. [4](#) ). Response rates were significantly greater for patients who received aripiprazole from week 3 through week 8 (Table  [2](#) ; Fig. [5](#) ). Subjects treated with aripiprazole demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in the mean CGI S score from week 2 through week 8 and the CGAS score at weeks 4 and 8. There was no significant difference between aripiprazole group and the placebo group in the mean ABC J stereotypy, inappropriate speech and lethargy/social withdrawal subscale scores, as well as ABC J response rate, CY BOCS (compulsion scale) (Table  [2](#) ).table wrap\n",

      "Data are expressed as number (%) EPS related AEs were found in 1 (2.2%) patient in the placebo group and in 3 (6.4%) patients in the aripiprazole group. In the aripiprazole group, EPS related AEs were observed in 2 (4.3%) patients (salivary hypersecretion) or 1 (2.1%) patient each (akathisia, gait disturbance, bradykinesia, lisp and tremor). 1 patient in the aripiprazole group experienced salivary hypersecretion, gait disturbance, bradykinesia, lisp and tremor. 1 (2.2%) patient in the placebo group experienced salivary hypersecretion as EPS. Mean serum prolactin concentrations at baseline were 16.7 ng/mL for placebo and 14.3 ng/mL for aripiprazole. Aripiprazole was associated with a significant decrease in serum prolactin concentrations compared with placebo from baseline to week 8 (−13.8 vs −2.0 ng/mL; p < 0.001). Sedation was reported as an AE in 2.1% (n = 1) of the aripiprazole group and no patients in the placebo group. Increased appetite was reported as an AE in 4.3% (n = 2) of the aripiprazole group and 2.2% (n = 1) in the placebo group. Weight gain was reported as an AE in 2.2% (n = 1) of the placebo group and no patients in the aripiprazole group. An increase in body weight of ≥7% from baseline was seen in 6.7% of the placebo group and 27.7% of the aripiprazole group. However, the mean change in weight from baseline to week 8 was not significantly different between aripiprazole and placebo (1.24 vs 0.58 kg; p = 0.085). The mean change in BMI from baseline to week 8 was significantly different between aripiprazole and placebo (0.40 versus 0.03 kg/m ^2^ ; p = 0.035). After treatment, the incidence rates of total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dL were: placebo, 9.1% and aripiprazole, 17.0%. No patients experienced fasting blood glucose ≥115 mg/dL, non fasting blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL, fasting triglyceride ≥200 mg/dL, non fasting triglyceride ≥500 mg/dL. No marked abnormalities were observed in the other clinical laboratory tests along with vital sign assessments and the 12-lead ECG, except for the decrease in serum prolactin concentrations in the aripiprazole group as described above.\n",
      "This study was 1 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, early phase trial. 50 patients seen at a fibromyalgia outpatient treatment program were randomly assigned to a daily soy or placebo (casein) shake. Outcome measures were scores of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES D) at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention. 28 patients completed the study. Use of standard statistics with intent to treat analysis showed that total FIQ scores decreased by 14% in the soy group (*P* = .02) and by 18% in the placebo group (*P* < .001). The difference in change in scores between the groups was not significant (*P* = .16). With the same analysis, CES D scores decreased in the soy group by 16% (*P* = .004) and in the placebo group by 15% (*P* = .05). The change in scores was similar in the groups (*P* = .83). # 3. Results ## 3.1. Baseline Characteristics A total of 50 patients (49 women) were recruited for this trial. Median age was 47.7 years (range, 18--76 years). There was no significant difference in age (*P* = .99), FIQ scores (*P* = .36) or CES D scores (*P* = .48) between the 2 groups. 28 patients (56%) --12 in the soy group and 16 in the placebo group (*P* = .39) --completed the 6-week trial. Reasons for not completing it are depicted in [Figure 1](#). Patients who did not finish the trial were significantly younger (median age, 39.8 years) than those who finished it (median age, 53.9 years) (*P* < .001). The median FIQ score was higher for patients who did not complete the trial (59.5) than for those who completed the study (54.8), but the difference was not statistically significant (*P* = .12). The median CES D score also was higher for patients who did not complete the trial (26.5) than for patients who completed the trial (14.0), but this also was not a statistically significant difference (*P* = .14). ## 3.2. Between Group Comparisons With intent to treat analysis, the total FIQ scores determined at study entry and at study completion decreased 14% (±29) in the soy group and 18% (±25) in the placebo group (*P* = .16). With per protocol analysis, the total FIQ scores decreased 29% (±36) in the soy group and 28% (±26) in the placebo group (*P* = .93) ([Figure 2](#)). With intent to treat analysis, the CES D scores improved 16% (±26) in the soy group and 15% (±41) in the placebo group (*P* = .83); with per protocol analysis, the CES D scores improved 33% (±30) in the soy group and 24% (±50) in the placebo group ([Figure 3](#)). However, the decrease between the groups was not statistically significant (*P* = .96). Using various cutoff points for depression (CES D ≥ 16, CES D ≥ 19 and CES D ≥ 27) and intent to treat analysis, we found a depression rate of 52%, 48% and 28%, respectively, in the soy group and 52%, 48% and 32% in the control group at study entry. After 6 weeks, these percentages were 48%, 44% and 24% in the treatment group and 48%, 36% and 24% in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups (*P* = 1.00). Determined by using per protocol analysis for these 3 different CES D scores, the percentages of patients with depression at study entry in the treatment group were 42%, 33% and 8% and in the control group were 38%, 38% and 19%. After 6 weeks, 33% of the treatment group had CES D scores of 16 or greater, 25% had scores of 19 or greater and 0% had scores of 27 or greater. The percentages for the control group were 31%, 19% and 6%, respectively. The separation test using the difference from baseline to 6 weeks showed no benefit for soy, as determined by FIQ scores and CES D scores for both intent to treat and per protocol analyses. We did not have enough information to make any recommendation for or against the use of soy using the separation test per protocol analysis based on total FIQ scores ([Table 1](#)). ## 3.3. Within Group Comparisons Significant, but modest, improvement in total FIQ scores (soy group, *P* = .02; placebo group, *P* < .001) ([Figure 2](#)) and CES D scores (soy group, *P* = .004; placebo group, *P* = .05) ([Figure 3](#)) between study entry and study completion was seen in both groups. Using 3 different cutoff points for depression (CES D ≥ 16, CES D ≥ 19 and CES D ≥ 27), we found no significant improvement using the McNemar test for the soy and control groups (*P* > .50). ### 3.3.1. FIQ Subclass Scores The average score of answers to questions 1 through 11 showed no significant improvement from before treatment to after treatment in both groups, as did the average score of answers to questions 12 and 13. However, the average score of answers to questions 14 through 20 showed significant improvement from before treatment to after treatment in the soy group (*P* = .004) and the placebo group (*P* = .001).

      "# Abstract # ABSTRACT ## Objective The aim of this double blind, placebo controlled and parallel  arm randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* SP1-containing probiotic sachet and azithromycin tablets as an adjunct to nonsurgical therapy in clinical parameters and in presence and levels of *Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis* and *Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. * ## Material and Methods 47 systemically healthy volunteers with chronic periodontitis were recruited and monitored clinically and microbiologically at baseline for 3, 6 and 9 months after therapy. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 4 periodontal sites with clinical attachment level ≥1 mm, probing pocket depth ≥4 mm and bleeding on probing, 1 site in each quadrant. Patients received nonsurgical therapy including scaling and root planing (SRP) and were randomly assigned to 1 probiotic (n=16), antibiotic (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15) group. *L. rhamnosus* SP1 was taken once a day for 3 months. Azithromycin 500mg was taken once a day for 5 days. ## Conclusions The adjunctive use of *L. rhamnosus* SP1 sachets and azithromycin during initial therapy resulted in similar clinical and microbiological improvements compared with the placebo group. # Results The flow chart of the study is shown in [Figure 1](#). 47 patients, 16 in the probiotic group, 16 in the antibiotic group and 15 in the placebo group were analyzed. Only 1 subject from the antibiotic group reported an adverse event (nausea). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flowchart of the study design</figcaption> </figure> ## Intergroup analysis At baseline, no significant differences in demographic, medical and clinical characteristics were found between groups (p>0.05, [Table 1](#)). Also, there were no intergroup differences in CAL, PPD, BOP, plaque accumulation, total cultivable microbiota and percentages of *P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans* and *T. forsythia* at 3, 6, and 9 months follow up ([Table 2](#) and [3](#)).table wrap\n",

In the probiotic group we observed a significant reduction of the clinical attachment loss at 3 and 9 months and of the PPD and plaque accumulation at all times of the follow up. In the antibiotic group, we perceived a significant reduction of the CAL and BOP at 3 and 6 months, as well as a significant reduction of the PPD and plaque accumulation at all times of the follow up. Finally, in the placebo group, the CAL, PPD and plaque accumulation decreased significantly at all times and the BOP at 3 and 6 months. Also, we observed a variation of the total cultivable microbiota, as seen in [Table 2](#). Compared with baseline, there was a significant reduction in the probiotic group at 6-month follow up, while for the antibiotic group it occurred at all times (p<0.017). In [Table 3](#), we analyzed the variation of the microbiological variables between the basal time and the 9-month follow up. The percentage of *P. gingivalis* (p<0.05) decreased in all the groups, compared with baseline. The reduction of the number of subjects with *P. gingivalis* was significant only in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "## METHOD: 1 total of 29 adults with pure tone hearing thresholds below 25 dB took part in the study. The participants were divided into a group of 19 firefighters exposed to occupational noise and a control group of 10 adults who were not exposed to such noise. All subjects were assigned a sound localization task involving 117 stimuli from 13 sound sources that were spatially distributed in horizontal, vertical, midsagittal and transverse planes. The 3 stimuli, which were square waves with fundamental frequencies of 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz, were presented at a sound level of 70 dB and were randomly repeated 3 times from each sound source. The angle between the speaker's axis in the same plane was 45°, and the distance to the subject was 1 m. ## RESULT: The results demonstrate that the sound localization ability of the firefighters was significantly lower (*p*<0.01) than that of the control group. # RESULTS The results were obtained from a cohort of 15 men and 4 women (n = 19). The test subjects' ages ranged from 23 to 41 years (mean = 31.4 with a standard deviation of 5.5 years, and the 10^th^ and 90^th^ percentiles were 23 and 40 years, respectively). The control group ages ranged between 20 and 45 years (mean = 29.6 with a standard deviation of 6.2 years). Correct sound source localization by the normal hearing firefighters is depicted in [Figure 1](#). Utilization of the ANOVA and Tukey's tests, however, demonstrated that the percentage of correct sound localization responses was statistically significant in the horizontal plane (*p* = 0.01). Conversely, those in the frontal plane were not statistically identical to the vertical plane (*p* = 0.03). [Figure 2](#) presents the firefighters responses in relation to the frequencies used. Very similar values were observed, and the mean percentages of correct answer for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies were 31.9%, 30.4% and 28.07%, respectively. Differences between the frequencies, as determined by the ANOVA and Tukey tests, were not statistically significant ([Table 1](#)). A comparison between the results obtained from the firefighter group and the control group is illustrated in [Figure 3](#). The numbers of correct responses, by spatial plane, between the control and test groups were significantly different (with *p* values less than 0.01, after applying the Student's t test). [Figure 4](#) compares the mean correct responses between the control and test groups according to the stimulus frequency. The control group obtained means that were 24%, 21% and 25% higher than those of the test group for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies, respectively. A comparison of the responses between the groups revealed that the number of correct responses was greater in the control group at all frequencies (*p* values were less than 0.01 using the Student's t test).table wrap\n",

      "## Methods This study was 1 prospective, multicenter, randomized trial with a 1:1 ratio of Genoss drug eluting stent (DES)™ and Promus Element™. Angiographic inclusion criteria were de novo coronary stenotic lesion with diameter stenosis >50%, reference vessel diameter of 2.5--4.0 mm, and lesion length ≤40 mm. The primary endpoint was in stent late lumen loss at 9-month quantitative coronary angiography follow up. Secondary endpoints were in segment late lumen loss, binary restenosis rate, death, myocardial infarction (MI), target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), and stent thrombosis during 9 months of follow up. ## Results We enrolled 38 patients for the Genoss DES™ group and 39 patients for the Promus Element™ group. In stent late lumen loss at 9 months was not significantly different between the 2 groups (0.11±0.25 vs. 0.16±0.43 mm, p=0.567). The rates of death (2.6% vs. 0%, p=0.494), TLR (2.6% vs. 2.6%, p=1.000), and TVR (7.9% vs. 2.6%, p=0.358) at 9 months were not significantly different. ## Conclusion This 1st in patient study of the Genoss DES™ stent showed excellent angiographic outcomes for in stent late lumen loss and major adverse cardiac events over a 9-month follow up. # RESULTS Between March 2013 and April 2015, 85 patients were screened for enrollment in the study. 5 patients did not meet inclusion criteria and a total of 80 patients were randomly assigned to the Genoss DES™ or Promus Element™ group at a 1:1 ratio. In the Genoss DES™ group, 2 patients were excluded as 1 patient did not receive stent implantation and the other patient had a protocol violation. In the Promus Element™ group, 1 patient was excluded owing to the patient's withdrawal from the study ([Figure 1](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow chart of patient enrollment.<br /> DES = drug eluting stent.</figcaption> </figure> Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics are shown in [Tables 1](#) and [2](#), respectively.

      "# Abstract ## Purpose Sonic hedgehog (SHH), an activating ligand of smoothened (SMO), is overexpressed in > 70% of pancreatic cancers (PCs). We investigated the impact of vismodegib, an SHH antagonist, plus gemcitabine (GV) or gemcitabine plus placebo (GP) in 1 multicenter phase Ib/randomized phase II trial and preclinical PC models. ## Patients and Methods Patients with PC not amenable to curative therapy who had received no prior therapy for metastatic disease and had Karnofsky performance score ≥ 80 were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1 to 1 ratio to GV or GP. To further investigate putative biologic mechanisms of SMO inhibition, 2 autochthonous pancreatic cancer models (Kras^G12D^; p16/p19^fl/fl^; Pdx1-Cre and Kras^G12D^; p53^R270H/wt^; Pdx1-Cre) were studied. ## Results No safety issues were identified in the phase Ib portion (n = 7), and the phase II study enrolled 106 evaluable patients (n = 53 in each arm). Median PFS was 4.0 and 2.5 months for GV and GP arms, respectively (95% CI, 2.5 to 5.3 and 1.9 to 3.8, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.21; *P* = .30). Median overall survival (OS) was 6.9 and 6.1 months for GV and GP arms, respectively (95% CI, 5.8 to 8.0 and 5.0 to 8.0, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.58; *P* = .84). 7 patients were enrolled onto the phase Ib open label GV portion, and no safety issues were identified. For the randomized phase II part of the trial, 111 patients were enrolled at 13 sites between February 2010 and June 2012, stratified by Karnofsky performance score (80 *v* 90 or 100) and disease status (newly diagnosed *v* recurrent; [Fig 1](#)). Of these, 4 patients withdrew consent before starting treatment (2 from each arm), and 1 patient (randomly assigned to GV) was subsequently found to have been ineligible and never started therapy. Analyses were based on the remaining 106 patients. Patient characteristics were similar between treatment arms, except for the incidence of peritoneal metastases, which were higher in the GP arm (9% *v* 23%; [Table 1](#)).(%) \n",

      "vismodegib.ORRs were similar in the 2 arms (GV: complete response [CR], 0 [0%]; partial response [PR], 4 [8%]; stable disease [SD], 27 [51%]; disease control [ie, CR + PR + SD], 31 [58%]; GP: CR, 1 [2%]; PR, 6 [11%]; SD, 20 [38%]; disease control, 27 [51%]). The difference in response rates (8% *v* 13%) was not significant (*P* = .53; Data Supplement). At the final analysis, events (progression or death) occurred in 48 patients (91%) receiving GV and 51 (95%) receiving GP. Median PFS was 4.0 months for GV and 2.5 months for GP (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.23; [Fig 2](#)A; Data Supplement). Hazard ratio (HR) after adjusting (adj) for Karnofsky performance score and disease status (newly diagnosed <em>v</em> recurrent).</figcaption> </figure> Median OS was 6.9 months for GV and 6.1 month for GP (adjusted HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.44; [Fig 2](#)B; Data Supplement). No survival differences were noted in a preplanned secondary analysis of OS that censored patients receiving GP at 1st progression, before crossover to GV (*P* = .69). For patients receiving GP who crossed over at progression (n = 22 [42%]), median PFS was 1.8 months, and median OS was 2.9 months (Data Supplement). 1 year survival rates in the GV and GP arms were 15% and 25%, respectively (*P* = .3). OS and PFS did not differ significantly by Karnofsky performance score (*P* = .66 and .42, respectively; Data Supplement). Median pretreatment plasma SHH level pooled for both treatment arms was 1.01 ng/mL (GV arm, 1.01 ng/mL; GP arm, 1.06 ng/mL). SHH levels did not change significantly with subsequent cycles (*P* = .087), nor was there a difference between treatment groups (*P* = .85) or patients with cancer (n = 89) and normal controls (n = 40; *P* = .4) ([Figs 3](#)A and [3](#)B). SHH serum levels did not correlate with age in either patients with cancer (*r* = 0.17; *P* = .13) or controls (*r* = 0.03; *P* = .87; [Figs 3](#)C and [3](#)D). Serum SHH levels (A) comparing controls (n = 40) with patients with pancreatic cancer enrolled onto trial (n = 89), (B) by treatment group (gemcitabine plus vismodegib [GV] or gemcitabine plus placebo [GP]) with increasing treatment (TX) cycle, and association with age in (C) patients with cancer and (D) controls. By univariable analysis, baseline computed tomography (CT) perfusion of the primary tumor was not associated with response to therapy, expressed as percent change in tumor size (*r* = −0.09; *P* = .77; [Fig 3](#)E; Data Supplement). Previous preclinical studies have suggested that SHH is abnormally expressed in genetically engineered models of PC.^[29](#),[37](#)^ SHH expression and pathway activation were confirmed in the KPP genetically engineered mouse model of PC by transcriptional gene analysis and immunohistochemistry. SHH immunoreactivity exhibited focal staining throughout tumors, predominantly in mucinous and well defined ductal epithelial cells (data not shown), consistent with previous reports.^[26](#)^ Comparative transcriptional analysis of normal pancreas and tumor revealed significantly elevated expression of Hh ligands *SHH* and Indian Hh (*IHH*), as well as *SMO*, glioma associated oncogene family zinc finger 1 (*GLI1*), *GLI2*, Hh Interacting Protein (*HHIP*), and *PTCH*1 (Data Supplement). To determine whether inhibition of SMO leads to changes in tumor stroma, we used a small molecule, HhAntag,^[38](#)^ a potent orally available preclinical surrogate of the US Food and Drug Administration -approved vismodegib (GDC-0449).^[10](#)^ Previous reports have shown that antagonism of Hh signaling resulted in increased mean microvessel density (MVD).^[29](#)^ HhAntag treatment on tumor bearing KPP animals revealed no significant change in MVD ([Fig 4](#)A; *P* = .54; Data Supplement), despite observing pathway inhibition (Data Supplement). Moreover, HhAntag treatment did not affect intratumoral extracellular matrix deposition assessed through trichrome staining ([Fig 4](#)B; *P* = .29). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Effects of hedgehog pathway antagonism (HhAntag) on vasculature, stromal content, and intratumoral gemcitabine metabolites in Kras<sup>G12D</sup>; p16/p19<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Pdx1-Cre (KPP) tumors. (A) Quantitation of immunohistochemical staining for meca-32 expression in pancreatic tumors of KPP mice treated with vehicle (circles; n = 13) or smoothened (SMO) inhibitor (squares; n = 13) for 10 days. Data presented as percentages of meca-32–positive areas over analyzed tumor areas for each tumor (Mann Whitney <em>P</em> = .54; scale bar, 200 um). (B) Quantitative analysis of stromal content by trichromatic stain in pancreatic tumors of KPP mice treated with vehicle or SMO inhibitor for 10 days. Data presented as percentages of positive stain areas over analyzed tissue areas (Mann Whitney <em>P</em> = .29). (C) Mass spectromic quantitation of intratumoral concentration of 2′,2′ difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP; active form of gemcitabine) from each tumor after treatment for 10 consecutive days with vehicle or SMO inhibitor and gemcitabine 50 mg/kg 30 minutes before tumor collection (Mann Whitney <em>P</em> = 1.000). (D) Ratios of 2′,2′ difluoro 2′ deoxycytidine (dFdC) to diflurodeoxyuridine (dFdU) in pancreatic tumors from each tumor (Mann Whitney <em>P</em> = .48). Gemcitabine undergoes intracellular conversion, from 2′,2′ difluoro 2′ deoxycytidine (dFdC) to the active triphosphate form 2′,2′ difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP), responsible for inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. To directly measure drug delivery, dFdCTP levels were analyzed in PC tumors of KPP mice after continuous 10-day HhAntag treatment and a single dose of gemcitabine. Liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that dFdCTP concentrations were similar in both vehicle  and HhAntag treated KPP mice ([Fig 4](#)C; Mann Whitney *P* = 1.00). The average ratio of dFdC to dFdU in KPP tumors of HhAntag treated mice was not significantly different between vehicle and SMO inhibitor groups ([Fig 4](#)D; *P* = .48). Growth rates of tumors, as determined by serial ultrasound imaging, were not significantly different when comparing HhAntag and vehicle arms, indicating no single agent effect of Hh pathway inhibition ([Figs 5](#)A and [5](#)B). Although the combination of gemcitabine plus HhAntag significantly decreased tumor growth relative to control treatment (log rank *P* = .0052), the growth rate was not different from that of gemcitabine alone, known to affect tumor growth in this model.^[39](#)^ Consistent with the lack of tumor growth effect, the HhAntag plus gemcitabine combination did not provide significant improvement in OS when compared with gemcitabine alone ([Fig 5](#)C). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Smoothened (SMO) inhibitor does not affect tumor progression or overall survival in Kras <sup>LSL G12D</sup>; p16/p19 <sup>fl/fl</sup>; Pdx1-Cre (KPP) mice.

Although the KPP model represents the genetics of a subset of the PC population, previous findings were generated in a model composed of mutant *KRAS* and mutant *p53* expression in the pancreas.^[40](#)^ Therefore, we reproduced all in vivo studies in the KR model. HhAntag treatment on tumor bearing KR animals revealed a significant decrease in MVD using meca-32 (Data Supplement; *P* = .0418) and trend toward decrease using CD31 (Data Supplement; *P* = .29). Trichrome staining revealed no significant changes to the stroma of HhAntag treated tumors (Data Supplement; *P* = .83). Finally, we observed no significant change in concentration of the gemcitabine metabolite dFdCTP in tumors after HhAntag (Data Supplement; *P* = .25) and no significant change in the ratio of dFdC to dFdU (Data Supplement). A significant decrease in microvessel density, consistent with previous work in transplantable models using vismodegib, was observed.^[41](#)^\n",
      "The increase in the restraint rate in the control site was 4.3 times greater than that in the intervention site. # 3. The preintervention sample at the intervention facility was considerably older---mean age 75.4 (SD 10.7) versus 59.1 (SD 17.4) of the control facility (*P* < 0.001). The two samples were different in terms of the number of medical diagnosis, with the study site having a mean of 3.1 diagnoses (SD 1.5) versus the control site's mean of 1.8 diagnoses (SD 1.2) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MMSE score of the study site was 16.7 (SD 7.0) versus control site's 25.4 (SD 5.3) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MBI score was 12.7 (SD 5.5) in the study site versus control site's mean 15.1 score (SD 3.2) (*P* < 0.001). The postintervention sample at the study site remained considerably older, with a mean age of 74.8 (SD 10.6) versus 62.9 (SD 17.7) in the control site (*P* < 0.001). Again, the two samples were different in terms of the number of medical diagnosis, with the study site having a mean of 3.2 diagnoses (SD 1.5) versus control site's mean of 1.9 diagnoses (SD 1.2) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MMSE score of the study site was 16.4 (SD 7.2) versus control site's 24.4 (SD 6.5) (*P* < 0.001); the mean MBI score of the study site was 12.0 (SD 5.1) versus control site's mean 15.1 (SD 3.4) (*P* < 0.001). The two facilities were also significantly different in terms of their gender composition---49.0% males in the study site versus 34.8% males in the control site. Then the baseline sample profile of the patients before the intervention in the study and control site were compared (Tables [1](#)(a) and [1](#)(b)). The control site had a significantly younger patient group than the study site (*P* < 0.001) in the nonrestrained patient group. This younger patient group probably resulted in the higher cognitive status as reflected in the significantly higher mean MMSE total score (*P* < 0.001) and the lower risk of fall as reflected in the lower Morse Fall Scale score (*P* < 0.001) ([Table 1(a)](#)). However, significant differences were found in age (*P* < 0.01) in both the nonrestrained and restrained groups of patients between the study and control sites. A significant difference in the experiences of falling in hospital (*P* < 0.01) was also found in the nonrestrained patients ([Table 1(b)](#)). Tables [2](#)(a) and [2](#)(b) provide information about the categorical variables of the samples recruited during the pre- and postintervention period in both sites. Significant differences were found in the MBI score (*P* = 0.016) and vision (*P* < 0.001) in the study site in the postintervention period when compared with the preintervention period. The mean MBI score was worse (30.3 versus 31.5) while there were more people with normal vision (39.2% versus 51.2%) after intervention. For the control site, there were significant differences in the age (*P* = 0.039) and the Morse fall scale (*P* < 0.001) in the postintervention when compared with the pre-intervention phase. The mean age was older (59.1 versus 62.9) and the mean MFS score (20.7 versus 30.3) showed a slightly higher risk post-intervention. In the control site, the overall restraint rate (including both intermittent and continuous) significantly increased from 2.6 to 8.3% (*P* < 0.000). Both intermittent and continuous use of restraint were significantly increased in the postintervention period, with intermittent restraint use increasing from 0.2 to 3.3% (*P* < 0.001) and continuous restraint use increasing from 2.4 to 5% (*P* < 0.001) ([Table 3](#)). In the study site, there was no significant difference in the overall restraint rate between the pre- and postintervention periods although the overall restraint rate had a slightly upward trend from 11.5% to 13.6% (*P* = 0.405) postintervention. There was a significant increase in the use of intermittent restraint, from 0.7 to 5.1% (*P* < 0.001), but a significant decrease of continuous restraint from 10.8 to 8.5% (*P* < 0.001) ([Table 3](#)) was also recorded. In this subsample, we found that there was a significant increase of patients with their restraints taken off after RRC conference (0% versus 18.2%, *P* = 0.014). There was an insignificant but slight increase of intermittent restraint (from 14.5% to 18.2%, *P* = 0.317), and there was a significant decrease of continuous restraint after RRC conference (from 85.5% to 63.6%, *P* = 0.009). The bed rail was the most common type of restraint (61.9%), followed by the jacket restraint and waist belt (both at 14.3%), with lap tables as the least common (9.5%) after intervention. In the study site, there was a decrease in the use of lap tables (from 48.0% to 39.2%) after intervention, but at the same time, there was an increase in the use of bed rails (43.3% to 51.8%) at the study site ([Table 2(b)](#)). Bed rail was the most common type of restraint, followed by lap table (39.2%) and jacket restraint (8.6%) in the postintervention period. No significant differences were found in the use of psychotropic medications in the study site (*P* = 0.346) and the control site (*P* = 0.075) comparing pre- and postintervention data. In the study site, only 3.3% of the subjects were prescribed psychotropic medications before intervention, and 2.3% were prescribed psychotropic drugs after intervention. In the control site, 2% of the subjects were on psychotropic medications, and none were prescribed (0%) after intervention. In the intervention site, the staff response rate in the preintervention survey was 82.2% (*N* = 97) and 77.4% after intervention (*N* = 89). No significant differences were found in their gender (*P* = 0.535), years of clinical experience (*P* = 0.684), with or without on-the-job training about restraint use (*P* = 0.179) pre- and post-intervention. Also, no significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (*P* = 0.147), attitude (*P* = 0.071), and practice (*P* = 0.139) before and after intervention using Janelli et al. 's (1991) validated questionnaire. When further analysis were conducted, a subsample of nurses (of one unit) were found to have better knowledge after intervention (mean score results: 5.51 versus 6.23, *P* = 0.04). In the control site, the staff response rate before intervention was 51.5% (*N* = 17) and 77.8% after intervention (*N* = 28). No significant differences were found in their gender (*P* = 0.431), years of clinical experience (*P* = 0.516), and with or without on the job training about restraint use (*P* = 0.948). Moreover, no significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (*P* = 0.436) and attitude (*P* = 0.498). There was, however, a significant decrease in their practice score (from 38.41 to 36.43, *P* = 0.048). The problematic practice behaviors included item C7 (I tell family members why the patient is being restrained), C8 (I explain to the patient why the restraint is being applied), and C9 (I tell the patient when the restraint will be removed). When comparing nursing staff samples of between the study and control sites, there were no significant differences observed in their gender distribution (before intervention: *P* = 0.279 and after intervention: *P* = 0.348), years of clinical experience (before intervention: *P* = 0.369; after intervention: *P* = 0.055), and with or without on the job training about restraint use (before intervention: *P* = 0.153; after intervention: *P* = 0.176). No significant differences were found in terms of knowledge (*P* = 0.230) and attitude (*P* = 0.986). However, there was a significant difference in their mean practice score (38.41 versus 36.43, *P* = 0.037), with the control site having relatively poorer scores.::::table-wrap\n",

      "## RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This prospective, 4-year, placebo controlled study randomly assigned 48 African American subjects with DKA and severe hyperglycemia to metformin 1,000 mg daily (*n* = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg daily (*n* = 16), or placebo (*n* = 15) after normoglycemia remission. Hyperglycemic relapse was defined as fasting glucose >130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and HbA~1c~ >7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at randomization and at 3 months and then every 6 months for 1 median of 331 days. ## RESULTS Relapse free survival was higher in sitagliptin and metformin (*P* = 0.015) compared with placebo, and mean time to relapse was significantly prolonged in the metformin and sitagliptin groups compared with the placebo group (480 vs. 305 days, *P* = 0.004). The probability of relapse was significantly lower for metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10--0.81]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10--0.98]) than for placebo. Subjects who remained in remission had a higher DI (*P* = 0.02) and incremental AUCi (*P* < 0.001) than those with hyperglycemia relapse without significant changes in Si. # Results 48 African American subjects with DKA (*n* = 22) and severe hyperglycemia (*n* = 26) were included in the study. 17 subjects were randomly assigned to metformin 1,000 mg daily, 16 to sitagliptin 100 mg daily, and 15 to placebo. 4 subjects in the metformin group, 6 in the sitagliptin group, and 1 in the placebo group were lost to follow up. 1 subject in the sitagliptin group and 1 subject in the placebo group withdrew from the study. The overall median follow up after insulin discontinuation was 331 days (interquartile range 102, 612 days) with no differences between randomized groups ([Table 1](#)). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics at presentation between subjects who withdrew and those who stayed in the study, except for HbA~1c~. HbA~1c~ was lower at presentation of DKA/hyperglycemia in subjects who withdrew compared with those who stayed (12.0 ± 2.3% [107 ± 25 mmol/mol] vs. 13.5 ± 2.0% [124 ± 22 mmol/mol], *P* = 0.03) but was similar at randomization.table wrap\n",

Hyperglycemia relapse free survival was significantly higher in the metformin and sitagliptin groups than in the placebo group (*P* = 0.015) ([Fig. 1](#)). The 2-year failure rate was higher in the placebo than in the sitagliptin (77% vs. 44%, *P* = 0.113) or metformin (77% vs. 34%, *P* = 0.013) groups. Compared with placebo, patients randomized to metformin (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10--0.814]) and sitagliptin (0.31 [0.10--0.98]) were ∼70% less likely to have a hyperglycemia relapse. However, there was no difference in hyperglycemia relapse free survival between metformin and sitagliptin (*P* = 0.75) ([Fig. 1](#)). The restricted mean time to hyperglycemia relapse in the combined metformin and sitagliptin groups was significantly higher than placebo (480 vs. 305 days, *P* = 0.004). A significant difference was found among the placebo, metformin, and sitagliptin groups (<em>P</em> = 0.015), but no significant difference was found between the sitagliptin and metformin groups (<em>P</em> = 0.75).</figcaption> </figure> We also assessed whether being on medication decreased the severity of hyperglycemia relapse. Because only a small number of subjects experienced relapse in the medication groups (metformin [*n* = 5], sitagliptin [*n* = 4]) compared with placebo (*n* = 11), we combined the metformin and sitagliptin groups. There were no significant differences in HbA~1c~ (8.0 ± 0.8% [64 ± 9 mmol/mol] vs. 8.2 ± 1.5% [66 ± 16 mmol/mol], *P* = 0.79) or blood glucose (152 ± 18 mg/dL [8.4 ± 1 mmol/L] vs. 160 ± 68 mg/dL [8.9 ± 3.8 mmol/L], *P* = 0.65) levels at the time of hyperglycemia relapse between the placebo group and the combined metformin and sitagliptin group.

      "In the present study, 57 schizophrenia patients were randomly assigned to (1) computer based facial affect training that focused on affect discrimination and working memory in 20 daily 1-hour sessions, (b) similarly intense, targeted cognitive training on auditory verbal discrimination and working memory, or (c) treatment as usual. Neuromagnetic activity was measured before and after training during a dynamic facial affect recognition task (5 s videos showing human faces gradually changing from neutral to fear or to happy expressions). Effects on 10--13 Hz (alpha) power during the transition from neutral to emotional expressions were assessed via MEG based on previous findings that alpha power increase is related to facial affect recognition and is smaller in schizophrenia than in healthy subjects. # Results *Clinical status*improved in all 3 SZ groups independent of type of intervention: general function (GAF *F* (2,53) = 16.92, *p*  < .001), positive symptoms (PANSS P *F* (2,53) = 17.92, *p*  < .001), and general symptoms (PANSS G *F* (2,53) = 10.30, *p*  < .001; PANSS N n.s.). 2](#)illustrates time -frequency representation (TFR) of power during face morphing prior to intervention. The HC19 group TFR showed an increase from baseline in the 10--13 Hz range between 1 s (morph onset) and 3.5 s after stimulus onset, with maximum around 3 s. This increase was not evident in any SZ group. 2](#) , bottom) confirmed significant differences between HC19 and pre intervention SZ in alpha power increase over a central sensor cluster in the time course from 2.5 to 3.5 s after stimulus onset. *FAT task performance*was poorer in SZ during their 1st FAT session than in the HC24 group during their 1 FAT session (same different task *F* (1,41) = 7.69, *p* = .008; blended emotion task *F* (1,41) = 8.24, *p* = .006; emotion sequence task *F* (1,41) = 16.11, *p*  < .001; emotion location task *F* (1,41) = 16.19, *p*  < .001; [Fig. 3](#) A). Performance improved with training on all 4 tasks in the FAT group, significantly in 3 tasks ( [Fig. 3B](#) , left): same/different, *F* (1,18) = 4.99, *p* = .04; blended emotion *F* (1,18) = 10.17, *p* = .005; emotion sequence *F* (1,18) = 3.28, *p* = .09; emotion location *F* (1,18) = 13.12, *p* = .002. In the last FAT training session, SZ no longer differed significantly from HC24 on 3 of the 4 tasks. SZ still performed worse in the emotion location task ( *F* (1,41) = 6.72, *p* = .01; see also effect sizes in [Fig. 3B](#) , right). ## FAT impact on MEG during FAR criterion task An Emotion × Time analysis of the FAT group produced a main effect of Time, *F* (1,18) = 5.61, *p* = .03 ( *p* = .02), reflecting a greater increase in alpha power from prestimulus baseline during the pre recognition period of the FAR criterion task after training than before training ( [Fig. 4](#) , left). Pre training, a Group (FAT pre training vs. HC19) × Emotion analysis indicated smaller alpha power increase in SZ than in HC19 ( *F* (1,36) = 22.05, *p*  < .001; [Fig. 3](#) ). A similar comparison of FAT post training vs. HC19 verified this effect (Group *F* (1,36) = 5.73, *p* = .02). Effect sizes indicated larger differences in alpha power modulation prior to FAT (fearful condition *g* = 1.29, happy condition *g* = 1.08) than after FAT (fearful condition *g* = .66, happy condition *g* = .58). 4](#)illustrates the change in alpha power increase after intervention in the 3 patient groups. An Intervention (FAT vs. TAU) × Emotion × Time analysis produced a marginal effect of Time, *F* (1,36) = 2.80, *p* = .1 ( *p*  > .1), reflecting some general improvement over time in the pooled sample, and an Intervention × Time interaction, *F* (1,36) = 4.78, *p* = .04 ( *p* = .05), reflecting improvement in the FAT group ( [Fig. 4](#) , left) vs. a nonsignificant decline in the TAU group ( [Fig. 4](#) , right). An Intervention (FAT vs. CE) × Emotion × Time analysis produced an effect of Time, *F* (1,36) = 8.54, *p* = .006 ( *p* = .008), reflecting improvement with training, but no Intervention × Time interaction, indicating similar improvement in the 2 active treatment groups ( [Fig. 4](#) ). Because the primary relevant hypothesis such an analysis addresses, that intervention improves brain function, is directional, a 1 tailed test of the Time effect would be appropriate, or equivalently a *p* = .10 criterion for the ANOVA effect. The Time effect exceeded that criterion, *F* (1,54) = 4.81, *p* = .03 ( *p* = .06), with alpha power increase from prestimulus baseline during the pre recognition period of the FAR criterion task larger after training than before training. A secondary hypothesis that an omnibus test could address is that interventions differed in their impact, thus a nondirectional Intervention × Time effect, which was marginal, *F* (2,54) = 2.44, *p*  < .10 ( *p* = .10). However, the motivation for the present study was the series of specific, directional, a priori hypotheses provided above, which, to achieve partial experiment wise error protection, were tested with a 2 tailed criterion. 5](#) left panel) varied with performance improvement during the blended emotion task ( *r* = .46, *p*  < .05; [Fig. 5](#) right panel). ## Neuropsychological test performance As expected in an SZ sample (e.g., [Kern et al., 2008, 2011](#) ), patient performance was below the normative *T* -score of 50 and varied by MCCB Domain ( *F* (6,324) = 12.83, *p*  < .001, HF = .94). MCCB performance generally improved after intervention (Time *F* (1,54) = 28.45, *p*  < .001). A Domain × Time interaction ( *F* (6,324) = 4.05, *p* = .001, HF = .91) reflected improvement in Processing Speed ( *F* (1,56) = 33.56, *p*  < .01), Attentional Vigilance ( *F* (1,56) = 15.82, *p*  < .01), and Visual Learning ( *F* (1,56) = 11.99, *p* = .001) but not in Working Memory, Verbal Learning, Reasoning, or Social Cognition (see [Table 2](#) for normative *T* -scores). There was a Time × Intervention effect, *F* (2,54) = 3.70, *p* = .03, resulting from significant performance improvement on Reasoning after CE, *t* (18) = 2.06, *p* = .05, not after FAT or TAU. There was no Time × Intervention × Domain effect ( *F* (12, 324) = 1.28, *p*  > .1).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background and Aims: Ropivacaine is 1 new amide, long acting, pure S enantiomer, local anesthetic, with differential blocking effect. ## Material and Methods: A total of 60 adult patients were randomly recruited to 2 groups of 30 each: Group I: 30 ml 0.75% ropivacaine + 1 ml normal saline. Group II: 30 ml 0.75% ropivacaine + 1 mcg/kg clonidine diluted to 1 ml with normal saline. ## Results: The onset of sensorimotor block was earlier in Group II (4.36 ± 0.81 min for sensory block and 9.83 ± 1.12 min for motor block) than in Group I (4.84 ± 0.65 min for sensory block and 10.85 ± 0.79 min for motor block). The duration of both sensory and motor block were significantly prolonged by clonidine ( *P* < 0.001). The duration of analgesia was also prolonged in patients receiving clonidine (613.10 ± 51.797 min vs. 878.33 ± 89.955 min). ## Conclusions: Ropivacaine 0.75% is well tolerated and provides effective surgical anesthesia as well as relief of postoperative pain. # Results There was no statistically significant difference in the demographic profile and the baseline values of hemodynamic variables between the 2 groups [ [Table 1](#) ]. 1 patient in the control group had block failure and was given general anesthesia. Significantly lower pulse rate was observed from 60 min to 180 min in the clonidine group, but was not clinically significant and did not need any intervention [ [Figure 1](#) ]. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Comparison of mean heart rate</figcaption> </figure> Mean arterial pressure dropped at 30-min and remained so until 150-min in the clonidine group [ [Figure 2](#) ].

      "Interferon gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10) and enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) involved in inflammatory responses in CHC. Vitamin D suppressed expression of IP-10 from monocytes *in vitro*. In CHC patients, DPP IV involved in IP-10 regulation. We hypothesized that correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in CHC patients might restore immune dysregulation through 1 pathway linked to the TH1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 or DPP IV. 80 CHC patients with vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were assigned to receive vitamin D (40) or placebo (40) supplements for 6 weeks. The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], Th1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 and DPP IV were measured at baseline and at the 6th week. At the end of study, the mean 25(OH)D level in vitamin D group was significantly increased and normalised. There were no changes in the level of Th1/Th2 cytokines. Our important finding revealed that upon correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, the serum IP-10 and DPP IV levels were decreased significantly as compare to the placebo group (delta changes; 83.27 vs -133.80; 95% CI [-326.910, -40.758], p = 0.0125, and 271.04 vs -518.69; 95% CI [-1179,15, -59.781], p = 0.0305, respectively. Our results offer a new insight and help to piece the puzzle of vitamin D deficiency, IP-10 and DPP IV together in CHC. **Trial registration:** Thai Clinical Trials Registry TCTR20160429001 # Results ## Study patients at baseline From January to December 2014, 80 patients were included into this study and randomly assigned to receive a placebo (n = 40) vitamin D supplement (n = 40). 42 patients were naïve cases without previous CHC treatment and 38 patients were previously failed therapy either relapsers or non responders.

In other words, we could postulate that serum IP-10 decreases with increase in serum VD levels, and each unit of VD increase will lead to 4.5 unit decrease in serum IP-10. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0174608.g003 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Scatter plot of post treatment VD levels (x axis) and post treatment IP-10 level (y axis) including fit line and regression equation were demonstrated.</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "# Abstract In order to assess the effects of juice feedings during acute diarrhea 1 double blind, randomized study was performed in 90 children, mean age of 10 ± 4.28 months. 30 patients with acute diarrhea were fed twice daily 15 ml/kg of Apple Juice (AJ), 30 received White Grape Juice (WGJ), and 30 were given colored and flavored water (WA) as part of their age appropriate dietary intake. The patients were similar among the 3 groups, had diarrhea for 50--64 hours prior to admission, and were dehydrated when admitted to the unit for study.1/2 of the patients in each group were well nourished and the others had mild to moderate degrees of malnutrition. Rotavirus infection was the agent causing the illness in 63% of the patients. The infants fed juice ingested 14--17% more calories than those given WA, (those receiving AJ and WGJ ingested 95 and 98 Calories/Kg/d respectively) whereas those receiving WA consumed 81 cal/kg/d). The mean body weight gain was greater among patients receiving WGJ (+ 50.7 gm) as compared with the patients in the AJ group (+ 18.3 gm) or the patients fed WA (  0.7 gm) (p = 0.08). The duration of the illness was longer in the infants fed juice as compared with those given WA (p = 0.006), the mean +/  SD duration in hours was 49.4 ± 32.6, 47.5 ± 38.9 and 26.5 ± 27.4 in patients fed AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. All patients improved while ingesting juice and none of them developed persistent diarrhea; most recovered within 50 hours of the beginning of treatment and less than 1 4th had diarrhea longer than 96 hours in the unit. The fecal losses were also increased among the juice fed patients (p = 0.001); the mean ± SD fecal excretion in g/kg/h was 3.94 ± 2.35, 3.59 ± 2.35, and 2.19 ± 1.63 in AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. The ability to tolerate carbohydrates during the illness and immediately after recovery was similar among the 3 groups of patients. # Results The clinical characteristics and the laboratory data of the patients on admission are shown in tables [2](#) and [3](#). The patients in each of the 3 groups were similar in age, duration and severity of diarrhea, presence of fever and vomiting. Over 46% of patients studied in each group, were well nourished, more than 33% showed mild body weight deficits (<1 SD) and the others had mild to moderate malnutrition (>2 SD).table wrap\n",

The WGJ patients ingested an average of 17% more calories on a daily basis, and the AJ infants consumed a mean of 14% more than the WA group. The increased energy intake was not at the expense of the other foods; both milk formula and complementary foods were ingested in similar quantities among the 3 groups of patients. The mean body weight gain was also higher among the juice fed patients; there was a mean weight gain of 18.3 gm in the AJ fed patients and of 50.6 gm in those given WGJ, whereas there was a mean loss of body weight (  7.0 gm) among the WA group patients (p = 0.08).table wrap\n",

The stool output was not different when the ORS intake was adjusted for the 3 groups of patients and the urinary outputs were also similar. Vomitus losses were not different among the 3 groups of patients, vomiting being present primarily during the first 24 hrs. There were 2 patients who had severe diarrhea during the treatment period (>10 ml/kg/hr). These patients were in the AJ group, 1 of these patients had acid stools and none had carbohydrates in feces. These 2 patients were treated with a lactose free formula, with improvement in stool output. There were 3 other patients who showed carbohydrate intolerance with acid stools or sugars in feces among the 3 groups, they improved without any dietary modifications. Vomiting was present in all groups of patients: 22 (AJ), 26 (WGJ), and 19 (WA) during the first day of treatment; nevertheless this did not represented a limitation for Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) or feeding regimen and no patient was withdrawn or shifted to another therapy due to vomiting. The response to juice feedings, as determined by breath hydrogen excretion after improvement of the illness, was not different among the 3 groups of patients. Most infants did not show breath hydrogen excretion levels above 20 ppm; and there were 17, 16 and 10 patients among the AJ, WGJ and WA groups respectively, who failed to show BH2 levels above 5 ppm at any time. Only 18 patients demonstrated a delta BH2 level increase above the basal value of more than 20 ppm. 8 of them were given AJ, 6 were fed WGJ and 4 received WA. There were 11, 16, and 13 patients in each group who exhibited a BH2 value above 20 ppm independent of the delta differences from basal among the WGJ, AJ and WA fed groups respectively. The differences in BH2 levels among groups were not significant.\n",
      "# Abstract ## Purpose To examine the pooled per protocol ocular end points from 2 conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) clinical trials of the dual action antihistamine bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution (BBOS) 1.5%. ## Methods 2 Phase III, placebo controlled, double masked, randomized clinical trials were conducted at 1 total of 6 separate centers using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis. The same study design was employed for both clinical trials, with subjects randomly assigned to either BBOS 1.5% (n=78) or placebo (n=79) treatment. Each subject received 1 eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours prior to a CAC. Primary ocular end points included changes in ocular itching reported at 3, 5, and 7 minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7, 15, and 20 minutes following each CAC. ## Results A statistically significant reduction in ocular itching was observed for BBOS 1.5% treatment compared to placebo at all time points (*P*<0.0001), while measures for onset and 8-hour persistence of action also reached clinical significance (ie, ≥1.0 unit difference) at a majority of time points. Secondary end points were also significantly improved compared to placebo, most prominently for reduced tearing at all study visits and reduced eyelid swelling at the onset of action and 8-hour study visits. ## Conclusion BBOS 1.5% rapidly reduced CAC induced ocular itching with duration of effectiveness of at least 8 hours after dosing. # Results ## Subject characteristics Subject demographics were well balanced between the BBOS 1.5% and placebo treatment groups ([Table 2](#)). No significant differences were found in the pair wise comparison of the demographic characteristics between the BBOS 1.5% and placebo treatment groups. ## Subject disposition A total of 439 subjects were screened as part of either the single site or the multicenter trials. Of those, 202 subjects were excluded at visit 1 or visit 2 because they did not meet all of the inclusion criteria ([Figure 1](#)). A total of 237 patients were subsequently enrolled and assigned to treatment groups according to a computer generated randomization code at visit 3A. third3 treatment arm that was not included in this analysis of pooled data, BBOS 1.0%, accounted for 80 of these subjects and has been previously discussed. [33](#),[34](#) The remaining 157 subjects comprised the intent to treat population. Of these, 140 subjects completed the study without a significant protocol deviation, and thus this subgroup constituted the per protocol population. ## Efficacy ### Ocular itching For the PP population, the differences in mean ocular itching scores between the BBOS 1.5% and the placebo group were found to be statistically significant (*P*<0.001) at all visits and time points by the Wilcoxon rank sum test and across all time points at a study visit by ANCOVA assessments ([Table 3](#)). In addition, the onset and 8-hour persistence of action measures were also clinically significant at all time points. A comparison of the difference between onset and 8-hour persistence of action scores shows that the treatment effect remained relatively constant over this time period (differences of 1.4--1.6 units at onset, and 1.3--1.5 units at 8 hours). Differences in mean ocular itching scores for BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo for the 16-hour persistence of action measures were also statistically significant (*P*<0.001) at all time points; however, the range of differences did not reach ≥1.0 unit difference at a majority of time points, the standard prospectively designated as clinically significant. [Figure 2A](#) shows the data for ocular itching scores by degree of resolution of itching (itching score =0), and demonstrates that more subjects in the BBOS 1.5% group compared to those in the placebo group experienced complete relief of CAC induced ocular itching. BBOS 1.5% was statistically superior to placebo at all CAC visits. In addition, the majority of BBOS 1.5% subjects reported 0 itching at the onset of action as early as 3 minutes after a CAC. Total itching relief was sustained at the 8-hour persistence of action visit for 1/3 of all subjects. In addition, a sizable number of subjects experienced complete relief from ocular itch even at the 16-hour persistence of action visit. [Figure 2B](#) shows the proportion of severely allergic subjects (baseline [visit 2] ocular itching scores ≥3) who experienced complete resolution of CAC induced ocular itching. The data demonstrate that the extent of complete relief was significantly better for BBOS 1.5% than for placebo at all study visits and was comparable to the results of the entire PP population, as seen in [Figure 2A](#). ### Conjunctival hyperemia [Table 4](#) shows the differences in mean conjunctival hyperemia scores for the PP population. Numerical reduction in hyperemia scores was superior for BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo at almost all time points. However, the criterion for clinical significance (≥1.0 unit reduction) was not met at any study visit. ### Secondary efficacy variables Consistent improvements in several secondary efficacy variables were seen with BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo. Data for ocular tearing were notable and are summarized in [Table 5](#). The percentage of subjects exhibiting tearing in response to a CAC ranged from 23% -39% from onset of action to 16 hours after drug instillation in placebo treated eyes compared to 6% -15% from onset of action up to 16 hours after drug instillation in BBOS 1.5% treated eyes. Additional end points, including ciliary and episcleral hyperemia, chemosis, and eyelid swelling, are summarized in [Table 6](#). All measures showed improvement for BBOS 1.5% compared to placebo based upon reduced mean scores. In particular, all of the end points showed statistically significant reductions by BBOS 1.5% at the onset of action CAC test for either all time points (chemosis and eyelid swelling) or the majority of the assessed time points (ciliary and episcleral hyperemia), and the results for ciliary and episcleral hyperemia were very similar to those seen for conjunctival hyperemia. Eyelid swelling was significantly reduced by BBOS 1.5% at all of the 8-hour persistence of action time points. ## Safety The AEs from these studies were based upon a safety population of all subjects who received at least 1 instillation of BBOS 1.5% or placebo. Overall, there were a total of 24 AEs in the PP population reported for the BBOS 1.5% treatment group and 10 AEs in the placebo treatment group ([Table 7](#)). The most common non ocular AEs included nasopharyngitis (n=3 for both treatment groups) and a mild taste upon instillation for the BBOS 1.5% treatment group (n=4). Among the few AEs that were ocular, the most commonly reported was eye irritation, which was seen in both the placebo (n=2) and BBOS 1.5% (n=3) treatment groups.table wrap\n",

      "## Methods This double blind, placebo controlled study was performed in 7 groups of 8 healthy male subjects. Doses of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 and 600 mg or placebo (2 subjects per group) were administered. Plasma macitentan and endothelin-1 and serum total bile salt concentrations were measured and analysed non compartmentally. Plasma and urine were analysed qualitatively for the presence of metabolites and 1 of these, ACT-132577, was also measured quantitatively in plasma. ## Results Macitentan was slowly absorbed and, at 1 dose of 300 mg, the t~1/2~ (95% confidence interval, CI) was 17.5 h (14.1, 21.8). The dose proportionality coefficient β for C~max~ (95% CI) was 0.83 (0.79, 0.87) indicating less than dose proportional pharmacokinetics of macitentan. In plasma, a pharmacologically active oxidative depropyl metabolite, ACT-132577, was found whereas in urine 2 minor metabolites were detected. The t~1/2~ of ACT-132577 (95% CI) was 65.6 h (53.1, 80.9). Macitentan dose dependently increased endothelin-1 concentrations up to 2.2-fold (95% CI 1.4, 2.4) at a dose of 600 mg, but had no consistent effect on total bile salts. Macitentan was well tolerated up to and including a dose of 300 mg, the maximum tolerated dose. # Results ## Subjects and tolerability 56 healthy male Caucasian subjects (age range: 19--49 years, body weight range: 55.4--98.0 kg) participated in this study and all completed the study as per protocol. A summary of the adverse events reported during the study, including those adverse events judged to be unrelated to study medication, is provided in Table [1](#). Up to and including a dose of 300 mg, the adverse event profile of macitentan did not significantly differ from that of placebo, whereas more adverse events than in the placebo group were reported at a dose of 600 mg. In this latter dose group, 5 out of 6 subjects reported headache of moderate intensity, accompanied by nausea and vomiting in 2 subjects. 2 cases of increased alanine aminotransferase to about 2 times the upper limit of normal or less were observed: in a subject who had received 600 mg of macitentan and the other in a subject who had received placebo. Both cases occurred 7 days after drug administration, whereas 48 h after administration liver enzymes were normal.table wrap\n",

The apparent terminal1/2 life could only be reliably estimated for the 2 higher dose groups and was about 16 h. The pharmacokinetics of macitentan showed a less than dose proportional increase for C~max~ as indicated by a value for the dose proportionality coefficient β (95% CI) of 0.83 (0.79, 0.87). Formation of the depropyl metabolite was slow with maximum concentrations attained at least 30 h after dosing (Fig. [2](#), Table [3](#)). In comparison to the parent compound, plasma concentrations of the metabolite were higher and elimination was slower as demonstrated by mean t~1/2~ values varying from 40.2 to 65.6 h. This resulted in a total exposure (AUC~0−∞~) to the metabolite that was 2.7-fold (95% CI 2.5, 2.9) greater than that to macitentan at a dose of 600 mg. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Arithmetic mean plasma concentration–time profiles of macitentan (<em>top panel</em>) and ACT-132577 (<em>bottom panel</em>) in healthy subjects (<em>n</em> = 6 per group except for 600 mg dose where <em>n</em> = 5) after administration of a single dose of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 or 600 mg of macitentan</figcaption> </figure>table wrap\n",

      "atypical plasma concentration -time profile 1 subject in the 600-mg dose group was excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis because of an atypical plasma concentration time profile of both macitentan and its metabolite. ## Metabolic profiling The investigation of the metabolic profile showed that in plasma only 2 compounds could be identified containing bromine atoms, macitentan and its metabolite, ACT-132577. In urine, the presence of 2 other compounds was shown, 1 that corresponds to a metabolite formed by hydrolysis of either macitentan or ACT-132577, and the other compound, based on the molecular weight, corresponds to a glucoside analogue of ACT-132577. Because in urine no macitentan and ACT-132577 could be detected, the collected urine samples were not analysed for these compounds. ## Pharmacodynamics Plasma endothelin-1 concentrations dose dependently increased following administration of macitentan (Fig. [3](#)) and this effect was statistically significant for doses of 25 mg and higher. The maximum effect was observed with the dose of 600 mg, which increased endothelin-1 concentrations 2.2-fold (95% CI 1.4, 3.4) compared with placebo. Administration of macitentan had no dose dependent effect on serum total bile salt concentration at single doses of up to 600 mg, although a small but statistically significant effect (*P* < 0.05) was observed for the lowest dose (Fig. [3](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Arithmetic mean (±SD) plasma endothelin-1 (<em>top panel</em>) and serum total bile salt (<em>bottom panel</em>) concentrations in healthy subjects after administration of a single dose of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 or 600 mg of macitentan (<em>n</em> = 6 per dose group) or placebo (<em>n</em> = 14). *<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05 compared with placebo</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background and Objectives: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is 1 relatively common, chronic inflammatory condition that frequently presents with symptoms of pain and burning sensation. Therefore, this study was aimed to compare the efficacy of treatment with topical pimecrolimus cream 1% with that of triamcinolone acetonide oral paste 0.1% in subjects with symptomatic OLP. ## Materials and Methods: A prospective, parallel group, randomized, active control clinical study was conducted among 30 symptomatic OLP subjects (20 females and 10 males, with 15 patients in each treatment group) treated with topical pimecrolimus 1% cream and triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% oral paste 4 times daily for 2 consecutive months and treatment free follow up was performed for 2 months. On intergroup comparison, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the reduction in burning sensation ( *P* = 0.18) and erythematous area ( *P* = 0.07), but there was a statistically highly significant improvement in reduction of clinical scoring ( *P* < 0.01%). Following the termination of the treatment, sustained remission of symptoms and long lasting therapeutic effects was detected in 93.3% of the patients treated with pimecrolimus. ## Interpretation and Conclusion: Topical pimecrolimus 1% cream showed better therapeutic response compared with triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% oral paste in subjects with symptomatic OLP. # RESULTS A total of 30 adult subjects were enrolled in the study, 20 females and 10 males, suggesting female predilection with a male to female ratio of 2:1. The age of the patients ranged from 20 to 64 years, and the mean age of the subjects was 36.7 ± 13.4 years. However, this reduction was higher in the pimecrolimus group than that in the triamcinolone acetonide group at the end of the 1 ^st^ month, i.e. 57% and 49%, respectively, and at the end of the 2 ^nd^ month (93% and 92%, respectively) Reduction in burning sensation was higher in Group A than in Group B, and it was statistically highly significant ( *P* < 0.01). During the treatment free follow up period, at the end of the 4 ^th^ month, reduction of burning sensation was 98% and 89%, respectively, and it was statistically highly significant ( *P* < 0.01). But, on intergroup comparison, at the end of the 1 ^st^ , 2 ^nd^ and 4 ^th^ months, it was statistically nonsignificant [ [Table 1](#) and [Figure 1](#) ].49% and 44%, respectively, at the end of the 1 ^st^ month (2 ^nd^ visit). Similar reductions were seen at the end of the 2 ^nd^ month, 80% and 85%, respectively, and this was statistically highly significant ( *P* < 0.01). During the posttreatment follow up of 2 months, it was 95% and 80%, respectively, which was statistically highly significant ( *P* < 0.01). On intergroup comparison, at the end of the 1 ^st^ and 2 ^nd^ months, it was statistically nonsignificant, but at the 4 ^th^ month during treatment free follow up it was highly significant ( *P* < 0.01) [ [Table 2](#) and [Figure 2](#) ]. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Intergroup comparison of clinical score</figcaption> </figure> Improvement in resolution of erythematous areas during the treatment at the end of the 1 ^st^ month was 80% and 20%, respectively in the pimecrolimus and triamcinolone acetate groups, which was statistically highly significant ( *P* < 0.01). At the end of the 2 ^nd^ month, none of the patients had existence of erythematous areas in both Group A and Group B and no statistical difference was found. After the posttreatment follow up of 2 months, the erythematous areas reappeared in 6.7% and 33.3% subjects in the pimecrolimus and triamcinolone acetonide groups, respectively, but no statistical difference was found ( *P* = 0.07) [ [Table 3](#) and [Figure 3](#) ].\n",
      "# Abstract # Abstract ## Background: In some studies, gum chewing was demonstrated to have 1 beneficial effect on resumption of bowel function; however, other contradictory findings in other studies refute the effects of gum chewing on peristaltic movements and digestive system stimulation. ## Methods: From March 2014 to March 2016, 75 patients with gastric cancer received elective laparoscopic surgery in Shanghai Tongji hospital and were postoperatively randomly divided into 2 groups: 38 in a gum chewing (Gum) group and 37 in a control (No gum) group. The patients in the Gum group chewed sugarless gum 3 times daily, each time for at least 15 minutes, until the day of postoperative exhaust defecation. ## Results: The mean time to 1st flatus (83.4 ± 35.6 vs. 79.2 ± 24.2 hours; *P* = 0.554) and the mean time to first defecation (125.7 ± 41.2 vs. 115.4 ± 34.2 hours; *P* = 0.192) were no different between the no gum and Gum groups. There was also no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative ileus (*P* = 0.896) and postoperative hospital stay (*P* = 0.109) between the 2 groups. The postoperative pain score at 48 hours (*P* = 0.032) in the Gum group was significantly higher than in the no gum group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in regards to patient demographics, comorbidities, duration of surgery, complications, and nausea/vomiting score. In addition, gum chewing may increase patient pain on the 2nd postoperative day. # Results Between March 2014 and March 2016, 85 patients participated in this trial. After 10 patients were excluded before randomization (see flowchart), a total of 75 patients were randomly assigned to either the Gum (n = 38) or No gum (n = 37) group. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups (Table [2](#)). 21 patients in the No gum group had comorbidities before their operations, as did 21 patients in the Gum group. The most common comorbidities included primary hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, post stroke syndrome, and coronary artery disease. The operation outcomes for both groups are shown in Table [2](#). 2 cases in the No gum group and 4 cases in the Gum group were converted to open surgery. There was no significant difference in the duration of operation between the 2 groups. The rates of POI of the 2 groups did not significantly differ. In the No gum group, 1 patient developed CD grade I complications: wound infection requiring dressing change. Grade II complications occurred in 2 patients: pneumonia requiring antibiotics. 1 patient developed a grade III complication: pleural effusion and atelectasis requiring thoracocentesis under local anesthesia. In the Gum group, 1 patient developed CD grade I complications: wound infection requiring dressing change. Grade II complications occurred in 4 patients: 2 developed pneumonia requiring antibiotics, 1 developed liver abscess requiring antibiotics, and 1 developed congestive heart failure requiring cardiac glycosides and diuretics. 2 patients developed a grade III complication: pleural effusion and atelectasis requiring thoracocentesis under local anesthesia. There was no significant difference in fentanyl consumption between the 2 groups (*P* = 0.969). As shown in Table [3](#), there was no significant difference in the mean time to the onset of gas passage (*P* = 0.554) or defecation (*P* = 0.192) between the 2 groups. There was also no significant difference in the incidence of POI (*P* = 0.896) and postoperative hospital stay (*P* = 0.109) between the 2 groups. Pain scores after operation are listed in Table [4](#). We found that the 48-hour postoperative pain scores in the Gum group were significantly higher (*P* = 0.032). However, the 24-, 72-, and 72-hour after pain scores were not significantly different between the 2 groups. We evaluated nausea and vomiting scores 24, 48, 72, and after 72 hours in the patients (Table [5](#)). Between the 2 groups, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 72 hours after nausea and vomiting scores were not significantly different.\n",
      "## Methods This study involved 1 group of smokers and nonsmokers who received 200 mg/day palmvitee and placebo for the control group. Blood samples were taken at 0, 12 and 24 weeks of supplementation. Urine cotinine levels and serum α~1~ antitrypsin were significantly higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Natural killer cells were decreased; CD4^+^ cells and B cells were increased in smokers compared to nonsmokers but were unaffected with vitamin E supplementation except in the percentage of B cells which were increased in nonsmokers supplemented palmvitee compared to placebo. CD4^+^/CD8^+^ ratio was increased in smokers compared to nonsmokers. The high TWBC count observed in smokers correlated with the increased CD4^+^ and B cells. ## Conclusions Smoking caused alterations in certain immune parameters and palmvitee supplementation tended to cause an increase in lymphocytes transformation test but had no effect on CD3^+^, CD4^+^, CD8^+^, NK cells and B cells except B cells percentage in nonsmokers. # Results ## Plasma total vitamin E level There was no difference in total plasma vitamin E, tocopherol and tocotrienol levels in smokers and nonsmokers at the beginning of the study (Figure  [1](#) & Table  [1](#)). After palmvitee supplementation, both plasma tocopherol and tocotrienol concentration were increased in smokers and nonsmokers (p < 0.05) starting from 12 weeks until the end of the experiment. Urinary cotinine and serum α~1~ antitrypsin of smokers were significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to nonsmokers (Table  [1](#)) but no changes were observed with supplementation. Urinary cotinine levels were increased accordingly to the number of cigarettes per day (Table  [2](#)).table wrap\n",

In separated group; S3, total CD3^+^ cells (T cell) increased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to nonsmokers before supplementation (Table  [2](#)) and remained unchanged in palmvitee supplemented group (Table  [7](#)). The percentage of B cells in smokers was higher compared to nonsmokers (p < 0.0001) and also in S1 (p < 0.005), S2 (p < 0.0005) and S3 groups (p < 0.005) (Table  [2](#)). After palmvitee supplementation, B cells percentage was significantly increased in nonsmokers at 24 weeks (p < 0.05) but not in the smokers (Table  [6](#)).

      "## INTRODUCTION: Many reasons exist for non adherence to medical regimens, and 1 of the strategies employed to improve treatment compliance is the use of active telephone calls. ## METHODS: Hypertensive patients (n = 354) who could receive telephone calls to remind them of their medical appointments and receive instruction about hypertension were distributed into 2 groups: 1) \"uncomplicated\" -  hypertensive patients with no other concurrent diseases and b) \"complicated\" - severe hypertensive patients (mean diastolic ≥110 mmHg with or without medication) or patients with comorbidities. All patients, except those excluded (n = 44), were open block randomized to follow 2 treatment regimens (\"traditional\" or \"current\") and to receive or not receive telephone calls (\"phone calls\" and \"no phone calls\" groups, respectively). ## RESULTS: Significantly fewer patients in the \"phone calls\" group discontinued treatment compared to those in the \"no phone calls\" group (4 vs. 30; p<0.0094). The percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) was increased at the end of the treatment (74%), reaching 80% in the \"uncomplicated\" group and 67% in the \"complicated\" group (p<0.000001). # RESULTS The study included 398 patients. Of those, 44 were excluded for the following reasons: a) lack of enrollment in the Biosintética Assistance program (n = 17); b) body mass index >40 kg/m^2^ (n = 6); c) secondary hypertension (n = 4); d) white coat hypertension (n = 3); e) white coat normotension (\"masked hypertension\") (n = 3); f) alcohol use (n = 2); g) classification error (n = 4); h) refusal to do ABPM (n = 2); i) loss of blood pressure measurements from the 1st visit (n = 1); j) pregnancy (n = 1); k) death (n = 1). A total of 354 patients were evaluated. There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, skin color, body mass index, blood pressure or heart rate between the groups classified as: \"complicated\" (n = 175) and \"uncomplicated\" (n = 179); \"traditional\" (n = 176) and \"current\" (n = 178); \"phone calls\" (n = 108) and \"no phone calls\" (n = 246) ([Table 1](#)). ## a) Control of Blood Pressure A marked reduction in blood pressure was seen in patients from both the \"complicated\" and \"uncomplicated\" groups ([Table 2](#)). The blood pressure was reduced by 19±10/20±14 mmHg in the \"uncomplicated\" group and by 18±14/22±17 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) in the \"complicated\" group (p>0.05; n = 354). The \"phone calls\" and \"no phone calls\" groups showed significantly lower blood pressures at the end of treatment (p< 0.00001). The \"traditional\" and \"current\" groups showed significantly lower blood pressures at the end of treatment ([Figure 1](#)). The percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) was also high at the end of treatment (74%). On the other hand, the percentage of patients with blood pressure reduced to <120/80 mmHg was only 29%. However, patients in the \"phone calls\" group (80%) had better blood pressure control than those in the \"no phone calls\" group (71%), though the difference was not statistically significant. The \"uncomplicated\" and \"complicated\" groups had statistically significant differences in the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) (80% vs. 67%, respectively; p<0.000001). At the next to last study visit (visit 7), 90% and 66% of patients had blood pressure measurements <140/90 mmHg in the \"uncomplicated\" and \"complicated\" groups, respectively. However, there was no difference in the percentage of patients with blood pressure <120/80 mmHg (31% on the final visit in both groups, [Table 3](#)). Among patients with a blood pressure <140/90 mmHg at the final visit, only 3% had received only 1 type of antihypertensive medication; most patients (56%) received 2 (34%) or 3 (22%) types of antihypertensive medication ([Table 4](#)). ## b) Treatment Discontinuation A significantly lower number of patients in the \"phone calls\" group quit the treatment compared to the \"no phone calls\" group (4 vs. 30, respectively; [Figure 2](#)). There was no difference in the percentage discontinuation in the \"complicated\" and \"uncomplicated\" groups or in the \"current\" and \"traditional\" treatment regimens (p>0.05). Compliance was over 85% at all visits. However, patients in the current + uncomplicated + phone call group had the highest rate of compliance (93%). The lowest rate of compliance occurred in the traditional + uncomplicated + no phone call group (85%) (p>0.05). ## d) Body Weight Blood pressure reductions occurred in the presence of increased body weight (baseline visit: 73±14 kg; final visit: 74±14 kg, p = 0.0008, [Table 5](#)). Patients in the \"traditional\" group showed significantly more depression symptoms (5 vs. 0) and coughing (30 vs. 4) when compared with patients in the \"current\" treatment group. On the other hand, patients in the \"current\" group had a greater number of complaints of dizziness when compared to patients in the \"traditional\" treatment group (63 vs. 42, respectively). Compared to patients in the \"uncomplicated\" group, patients in the \"complicated\" group presented a larger number the following symptoms: abdominal pain (19 vs. 8), sleepiness (32 vs. 10), cough (23 vs. 11), weakness (23 vs. 11) and blurred vision (6 vs. 0). Conversely, compared to patients in the \"complicated\" group, patients in the \"uncomplicated\" group presented a larger number of complaints such as pain (74 vs. 53) and headache (80 vs. 59). Patients in the \"phone calls\" group reported a 34% rate of symptoms, while a 66% rate of symptoms was reported by patients in the \"no phone calls\" group. The most frequently (>10%) found adverse events were as follows: headache (62.1%), unspecific pain (58.2%), dizziness (45.8%), edema (40.1%), fatigue (15.3%), sleepiness (14.4%), cough (13.3%), precordial pain (13.3%), weakness (11.9%), tachycardia (11.3%), insomnia (10.5%) and paresthesia (10.5%). There were 26 (8%) severe adverse events: death (5), unstable angina (4), acute myocardial infarction (1), transient ischemic attack (1), hypertensive encephalopathy (1), breast cancer (3), bronchospastic crisis (1), cholecystopathy (1), diabetic decompensation (1), syncope (1), nephrectomy (2), trauma (2), peritoneal bypass (1), diarrhea (1) and gastrectomy (1). The results of the laboratory tests performed in the beginning and end of the study are shown in [Table 6](#). There was an increase in the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion from the beginning to the end of the study (120±46 vs. 129±45 mEq/L, respectively; p = 0.000036):::\n",

      "## Methods In 1 prospective randomized double blind clinical trial performed in the emergency department of Imam Reza educational hospital of Tabriz, Iran, we studied 240 patients, 18--65 years old, who were referred due to renal colic. Patients were divided into 2 groups. In group I (120 people) single dose intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) was administered and in group II (120 people) single dose intravenous morphine (0.1 mg/kg) was administered slowly. Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) was recorded while admission, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes after injection. To compare the response to treatment, Mann -Whitney *U* test was used in 2 groups. Consequently, the data were analyzed using the SPSS16 software. ## Results Pain score measured in 2 groups 5 minutes after the injection of lidocaine and morphine were 65 % and 53 % respectively (95% CI 0.60 - 0.69, CI 0.48 -  0.57, p = 0.0002).108 (90 %) patients (95 % CI 0.84 -  0.95) from group I and 84 (70%) patients (95 % CI 0.62 - 0.78) from group II responded appropriately at the end of the complete treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0001). ## Trial registration Clinical Trials IRCT138901042496N3 # Results 86 patients of studied samples were male and 34 were female in group I. In group II, 90 patients were male and 30 were female. There was no statistically significant difference between them regarding gender distribution (p = 0.559) (Table [1](#)).table wrap\n",

      "## Methods This 48-week prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study evaluated high dose vitamin D3 (4000 IU daily) plus calcium supplementation (1000 mg calcium carbonate daily) in HIV infected participants initiating ART with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF). Changes in insulin resistance (as estimated by homeostatic model assessment), fasting lipid profile, and components of the metabolic syndrome were assessed at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks. Stratified Wilcoxon rank sum tests and stratified normal score tests were used to evaluate differences between treatment arms, stratified by screening 25-OH vitamin D stratum (≤/>20 ng/mL). ## Results 1 total of 165 participants enrolled: 79 in the vitamin D/calcium (Vit D/Cal) arm and 86 in the placebo arm. Only the placebo arm experienced a modest increase in insulin resistance at week 24 (*P* < .001). While increases in total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were significant in both arms at weeks 24 and 48, increases in low density lipoprotein cholesterol at week 24 were only identified in the placebo arm (*P* = .011). Metabolic syndrome was present in 19 participants (12%) at baseline and 20 participants (14%) at week 48, without differences between arms. ## Conclusions Vit D/Cal supplementation over 48 weeks did not alter the lipid profile or glucose metabolism experienced with initiation of EFV/FTC/TDF in ART naïve persons. # RESULTS The details and disposition of the study population have been previously described [[20](#)]. Of the 165 eligible participants included this analysis (79 in the VitD/Cal arm, 86 in the placebo arm), 148 (90%) completed 48 weeks of study treatment. 25 (15%) participants discontinued EFV/FTC/TDF prematurely (13 in VitD/Cal and 12 in placebo). ## Baseline Demographics Baseline characteristics are shown in [Table 1](#). For the overall study population at baseline, the median age was 33 years, 90% male, 37% white non Hispanic, 33% black non Hispanic, with a median body mass index (BMI) of 24.4 kg/m^2^ ([Table 1](#)).table wrap\n",

      "the 2 treatment arms, stratified by screening 25-OH vitamin D levels. ## Lipid Profile Baseline lipid parameters appear to be balanced between the treatment arms ([Table 1](#)). Fasting total and HDL cholesterol levels increased significantly by weeks 24 and 48 for both arms, with no significant differences between the 2 arms ([Table 2](#)). In the placebo arm, LDL cholesterol increased at week 24 from baseline but not at week 48. However, triglyceride changes from baseline to week 24 or week 48 were not significant in either arm. ## Glucose Metabolism and Measures of Insulin Resistance Baseline fasting glucose and insulin levels, as well as HOMA IR values, appear to be balanced between arms ([Table 1](#)). Glucose levels were increased modestly at weeks 24 and 48 in both arms ([Table 2](#)). Insulin levels increased in the placebo arm but not in the VitD/Cal arm at week 24, while the week 48 changes were not statistically significant for either arm. HOMA IR increases were modest for both arms only at week 24. Between arm differences were not significant for glucose, insulin, or HOMA IR changes at either week 24 or week 48 (*P* > .05 for all). ## Body Composition and Metabolic Syndrome Baseline waist circumference and BMI values appear to be balanced between the 2 arms ([Table 1](#)). Waist circumference increased in the placebo arm but not in the VitD/Cal arm at both weeks 24 and 48, but differences between the 2 arms were not significant ([Table 2](#)). Changes in BMI were not significant over 48 weeks for either arm. Metabolic syndrome was identified in 19 participants (12%) at baseline and 20 participants (14%) at week 48, with no significant difference between arms. For specific parameters of the metabolic syndrome, low HDL prevalence decreased from a 45% overall prevalence at baseline to 26% at week 48, and elevated TG prevalence increased from a 14% overall prevalence at baseline to 22% at week 48.\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Negative attentional biases are thought to increase the risk of recurrence in depression, suggesting that reduction of such biases may be 1 plausible strategy in the secondary prevention of the illness. ## Methods 61 patients with at least 2 previous episodes of depression who were currently in remission were randomized to receive either an active (positive) or placebo computer based ABM regime. Residual depressive symptoms, measured using the Beck Depression Inventory and the cortisol awakening response were measured immediately before and after completion of the bias modification and then again after 4 weeks' follow up. # Results ## Group Demographics, Baseline Measures, and Compliance As can be seen from [Table 1](#), the groups were well matched on baseline demographics, IQ, and measures of illness severity. Patients had been depressed on an average of 3 previous occasions. Compliance was generally high with only 8 patients completing fewer than 25 sessions of ABM and no difference in compliance between the groups. ## The Effect of ABM on Residual Symptoms Positive, relative to placebo, ABM influenced the residual depressive symptoms reported by patients using the BDI, but this effect depended on whether the ABM used faces or words [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; *F*(2,112) = 3.7, *p* = .03]. There was no general ABM type × time effect [*F*(2,112) = 1.1, *p* = .35]. As can be seen from [Figure 2](#) positive, face based ABM lead to a reduction of symptoms compared with placebo ABM [[Figure 2](#)A; *F*(2,56) = 3.7, *p* = .03], whereas word based ABM had no significant effect [[Figure 2](#)B; *F*(2,56) < 1, *p* = .4]. Interestingly, the beneficial effect of positive face ABM displayed a time lag; symptoms did not change across the 2 weeks of ABM [ *F*(1,28) < 1, *p* = .5]; rather, they reduced during the follow up period [*F*(1,28) = 5.9, *p* = .02] with this change resulting from a significant drop in symptoms reported by the positive face ABM group [*t*(15) = 2.4, *p* = .03] and no significant change seen in the placebo face ABM group [*t*(13) < 1, *p* = .4]. Observer reported depressive symptoms, measured using the HRSD, revealed an identical ABM type × ABM stimuli × time interaction [[Figure 2](#)C and [2](#)D; *F*(2,112) = 3.4, *p* = .04]; however, in this case, the post hoc tests of the interaction for face training was significant only at a trend level [*F*(1,28) = 2.9, *p* = .09]. Symptoms of anxiety, measured using the trait subscale of the STAI displayed the same specific effect of positive face ABM as that seen for the BDI [[Figures 2](#)E, F; *F*(2,112) = 3.3, *p* = .05] with the beneficial effect again occurring during follow up [ *F*(1,28) = 5.2, *p* = .03] and being driven by a significant reduction of anxious symptoms in the positive face ABM group [*t*(15) = 2.4, *p* = .03]. ## The Effect of ABM on the CAR Analysis of the CAR response revealed a significant ABM type × ABM stimuli interaction [*F*(1,53) = 4.3, *p* = .04], which was present across the 3 time points [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; *F*(2,106)<1, *p* = .4]. In keeping with the effects on residual symptoms, face based ABM influenced the CAR [[Figure 3](#)A; *F*(2,54) = 4, *p* = .02], whereas word based ABM did not [[Figure 3](#)B; *F*(2,52) < 1, *p* = .8]. Specifically, positive relative to placebo face ABM caused a reduction of the CAR across the follow up period [*F*(1,27) = 5, *p* = .03] with no change being seen during ABM [*F*(1,27) < 1, *p* = .9]. This relative reduction was produced by a nonsignificant decrease in the positive ABM group during follow up [*t*(14) = 1.7, *p* = .1] and a nonsignificant increase in the placebo group [ *t*(13) = 1.5, *p* = .2]. ## The Effect of ABM on Attentional Function Positive relative to placebo bias modification produced a differential effect on attentional bias ([Figure 4](#)), as measured by the word based visual probe task [ABM type × time; *F*(2,112) = 3.1, *p* = .05]. However, unlike the previous results, this effect did not significantly differ between the face  and word trained groups [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; *F*(2,112) < 1, *p* = .9]. The effect of ABM was seen across the bias modification period [ *F*(1,57) = 8.3, *p* = .006] with no significant change occurring across follow up [*F*(1,56) < 1, *p* = .4]. When considering the within group effects produced, positive face ABM led to a significant increase in positive bias across the modification period [*t*(15) = 3.7, *p* = .002], whereas face placebo ABM did not change the bias [*t*(13) < 1, *p* = .9]. Interestingly, the effect of word ABM was driven by a trend level decrease in bias in the placebo word group [*t*(14) = 2.1, *p* = .051] with no effect seen for positive word ABM [ *t*(15)<1, *p* = .5]. The correlation between change in attentional bias across the bias modification period and reduction in BDI or CAR across the follow up period in the positive face ABM group was not significant [ *r*(16) = .37, not significant, and *r*(15) = .34, not significant, respectively]. Additional analysis is provide in [Supplement 1](#). Attentional bias, assessed using face stimuli, was insensitive to the effect of the ABM interventions [*F*(2,112)<1, *p* = 1]. This remained the case when analysis was restricted to those who had completed face based ABM [*F*(2,56) < 1, *p* = .7]. <strong>(A)</strong> Patients completed 3 assessment sessions, immediately before and after 2 weeks of ABM and then again a month later. <strong>(B)</strong> Each participant was randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups using a factorial design. This design allows assessment of the main effects of both ABM type and the stimuli used in ABM as well any interaction between the 2. <strong>(C)</strong> 2 example trials from the ABM task completed by patients. On each trial 2 stimuli were presented, followed by a probe (1 or 2 dots) to which the patients had to respond. During positive ABM (shown) the probe appeared behind the more positive of the 2 stimuli; the placebo ABM condition was identical in every respect other than that the probe was equally likely to appear behind either stimulus. Symptoms, which are displayed as a change from baseline of the mean scores, were measured at 3 time points; before bias modification, after bias modification, and after 1-month follow up. *<em>p</em> &lt; .05 for post hoc test of interaction.

      "# Abstract Recent research on whole body cryotherapy has hypothesized 1 major responsibility of head cooling in the physiological changes classically reported after a cryostimulation session. Over 5 consecutive days, 2 groups of 10 participants performed 1 whole body cryostimulation session daily, in 1 of 2 different systems; 1 exposing the whole body to cold (whole body cryostimulation, WBC), and the other exposing the whole body except the head (partial body cryostimulation, PBC).10 participants constituted a control group (CON) not receiving any cryostimulation. In order to isolate the head cooling effect on recorded variables, it was ensured that the WBC and PBC systems induced the same decrease in skin temperature for all body regions (mean decrease over the 5 exposures: -8.6°C±1.3°C and -8.3±0.7°C for WBC and PBC, respectively), which persisted up to 20-min after the sessions (P20). The WBC sessions caused an *almost certain* decrease in tympanic temperature from Pre to P20 (-0.28 ±0.11°C), while it only decreased at P20 (-0.14±0.05°C) after PBC sessions. Heart rate *almost certainly* decreased after PBC (-8.6%) and WBC (-12.3%) sessions. Resting vagal related heart rate variability indices (the root mean square difference of successive normal *R R* intervals, RMSSD, and high frequency band, HF) were *very likely* to *almost certainly* increased after PBC (RMSSD:+49.1%, HF: +123.3%) and WBC (RMSSD: +38.8%, HF:+70.3%). Plasma norepinephrine concentration was *likely* increased in similar proportions after PBC and WBC, but only after the 1st session. ## Skin and tympanic temperatures Baseline skin temperature (Tskin) for all body regions was similar between groups before the cryostimulation, without difference between the first and1/5 cryostimulation session ([Fig 2](#)). Each day, an *almost certain* very large reduction in mean skin temperature of the whole body was recorded within the 20-min after the PBC and WBC exposures ([Fig 2](#)). However, no difference was recorded between cryotherapy modalities from Post to P20. In both modalities, the mean Tskin *almost certainly* remained lower than baseline values up to P20 ([Fig 2](#)). In both modalities, a *very likely* large reduction in Tskin of the head was recorded in Post and persisted up to P5, in larger proportion for WBC than PBC ([Fig 2](#)). In both cryotherapy modalities, the mean decrease in Tskin for the whole body recorded immediately after (Post) the first cryostimulation session (-8.3±0.7°C and -8.6°C±1.3°C for PBC and WBC, respectively) was *very likely* larger than that recorded after the fifth cryostimulation session (-7.6±0.8°C and -7.7±0.9°C for PBC and WBC, respectively). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0124776.g002 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Changes in the mean skin temperature of the whole body (except the head) and the head alone.<br /> Values were recorded before (Pre), immediately after (Post) and for 20-min (P1 to P20) after the first and the fifth whole body cryostimulation (WBC), and partial body cryostimulation (PBC) sessions, and in the control (CON) condition.

      "# Abstract Stress related illnesses are 1 growing health problem in the Western world; which also has economic significance for society. The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial in which 84 participants are randomly allocated between the treatments. The results show that both the NNBT and the STreSS lead to a significant decrease in number of contacts with a general practitioner in the period from 12 months prior to treatment to 12 months after treatment; and, a significant decrease in long term sick leave from the month prior to treatment to 12 months after treatment. # 3. Results Of the 83 participants allocated between the 2 treatments, 41 participants completed the NBT treatment and 40 participants completed the CBT treatment (see [Figure 1](#)). 4 participants in the NBT were lost to follow up because the correct personal identification number was not provided. 5 participants were lost to follow up in the CBT; 4 participants did not provide the correct personal identification number; and, 1 participant withdrew consent after the treatment. The results from the background questionnaire showed that the vast majority of participants were women (NBT: 82%, CBT: 82%) with a mean age of 47.9 in NBT and 44.9 in CBT [[11](#)]. The majority had a university bachelor degree or higher education (NBT: 76%, CBT: 68%). The categorization of participants with respect to socioeconomic status showed an even distribution between the 2 treatments; the majority of participants in both NBT and CBT were employed at the start of treatment (NBT = 20; CBT = 21), and a great number held a top level position (NBT = 13; CBT = 12) ([Table 1](#)). A substantial proportion of participants were also registered as unemployed at treatment start (NBT = 18; CBT = 18). Of those, 17 participants from the NBT and 16 participants from the CBT were fired from work during the 12 months preceding the start of treatment. Moreover, 1 participant in the NBT and 2 participants in the CBT quit their job during that period. ## 3.1. Sick Leave All of the participants were rated as incapacitated for work for at least 3 months prior to treatment start, as stated in the inclusion criteria, but not all participants were registered as being on sick leave in Statistics Denmark prior to treatment start ([Figure 2](#)). The sample distributions, representing the number of months of sick leave, expressed significant deviations from the normal distribution (*p* < 0.05). No significant change was found in the total number of months of sick leave for the participants in the period from 12 months before the treatment compared to the 12 months after the treatment for either the NBT or the CBT treatments (*p* > 0.05). [Figure 2](#) illustrates the continous increase in the number of participants on sick leave in the 12 months up to the start of treatment and, similarly, the similar decrease in the number of participants on sick leave from the end of the treatment to 12 months after. A significant decrease was found between the participants on sick leave 1 month prior to treatment and in month 12 after treatment (NBT: *p* < 0.001; CBT: *p* < 0.01), ([Table 2](#)). 23 participants (77%) who were on sick leave prior to treatment and received the NBT treatment were not on sick leave 12 months after completing the treatment ([Table 2](#)). 15 participants (60%) who were on sick leave prior to treatment start and received the CBT treatment were not on sick leave 12 months after completing the treatment ([Table 2](#)). In total, 27 participants from the NBT group and 20 participants from the CBT group were not on sick leave after completing the treatment. ## 3.2. Healthcare Consumption For the NBT and the CBT, there was a significant reduction in number of contacts with a GP 12 months after treatment as compared to the 12 months before treatment (NBT *p* ˂ 0.01; CBT *p* ˂ 0.05) ([Table 3](#)). The sizes of the effect were r = −0.396 (NBT) and r = −0.249 (CBT). In terms of the number of contacts, the median number of contacts with a GP is still much higher for the participants 1 year after the treatment for both the NBT and the CBT groups when compared to the adult population of Denmark as a whole (mean number of contacts = 5.95) [[24](#)]. Nevertheless, the 2 statistical measures are still comparable in terms of understanding the central tendency of the statistical scores). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Participant flow diagram.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>The proportion of participants on sick leave from 12 months prior to 12 months after a treatment.

      "# Abstract ## Background Since the 1st facial allograft transplantation was performed, several institutions have performed the procedure with the main objectives being restoration of the aesthetic appearance and expressive function of the face. There are currently 2 primary methods to perform facial nerve neurorrhaphy between the donor and recipient 1 protocol involves transection and repair of the facial nerve at the main trunk while the another protocol advocates for the neurorrhaphy to be performed distally at the main branches. ## Methods 1 prospective randomized controlled trial using a rat model was performed. 2 groups of 12 rats underwent facial nerve transection and subsequent repair either at the main trunk of the nerve (group 1) or 2 cm distally, at the main bifurcation (group 2). Primary outcome of nerve functional recovery was measured using a previously validated laser curtain model, which measured amplitude of whisking at 2, 4, and 6 post operatively. ## Results At week 2 post nerve surgery, the average amplitude observed for group 1 and 2 was 4.4 and 10.8 degrees, respectively. At week 4, group 1 showed improvement with an average amplitude of 9.7 degrees, while group 2 displayed an average of 10.2 degrees. The week 6 results showed the greatest improvement from baseline for group 1. Group 1 and 2 had average amplitudes of 17.2 and 6.9 degrees, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after facial nerve surgery (*p*  > 0.05). ## Conclusions We found no statistical difference between these 2 locations of nerve repair using identical methods. 3 animals had problems with suture break down post operatively. This occurred in all 3 animals within 5 days of the surgical procedure. For these animals, we re anesthetized them with isoflurane and were able to re approximate the incision edges with 3--0 vicryl sutures. At week 2 the average amplitude observed for group 1 was 4.4 degrees (Table [1](#)). Similarly, the group 2 average was 10.8 degrees at 2 weeks post operatively. At week 4, group 1 showed improvement having an average of 9.7 degrees, while group 2 remained relatively unchanged with an average of 10.2 degrees. The week 6 results showed the greatest improvement from baseline for group 1. Group 1 had an average amplitudes of 17.2 degrees at 6-weeks from surgery (Fig. [8](#)). However, group 2 showed a slight decrease in amplitude with an average of 5.9 degrees. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after facial nerve surgery (p > 0.05).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objective: The objective of this study is to examine the impact of vary doses of buprenorphine on anxiety symptoms in opioid dependent inpatients over 1 7 days period, using a randomized controlled trial design. ## Design: Patients were randomized to 3 groups. ## Patients and Methods: 14 men who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,1/5 Edition criteria for both opioid use disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and were seeking for treatment. ## Intervention: Patients obtain dosages of 32 mg or 64 mg or 96 mg of buprenorphine as a single dose only and were treated in a psychiatric inpatient unit. Of 14 subjects; 5 (35.7%) obtained 32 mg, 4 (28.6%) obtained 64 mg, and 5 (35.7%) obtained 96 mg of buprenorphine. ## Results: All the patients ended the 7-day treatment time. The results showed a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms within each of the 3 groups ( *P* = 0.00), but no difference in outcome between the groups ( *P* = 0.605). # RESULTS All the 14 inpatients completed the 7-day period study. Hence, the data were gathered from 14 male opioid dependents whose mean age was 31.87 ± 8.15 year; with age range of 17--48 years. Out of 14 patients; 5 (35.7%) obtained 32 mg, 4 (28.6%) obtained 64 mg and also 5 (35.7%) obtained 96 mg of buprenorphine. [Table 1](#)demonstrates demographic features of the patients.table wrap\n",

      "We perform this study to assess the impact of 3 different hemostatic materials on perioperative blood loss. ## Methods We performed 1 Randomized Controlled Trial research and recruited patients with lumbar disease into the study between November 2013 and March 2015. All the participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups using a simple equal probability randomization scheme: Group A (Stypro hemostatic sponge), Group B (Collagen hemostatic sponge) and Group C (gelatin sponge). We compared postoperative blood loss between these 3 groups. ## Results In our study, drainage volume in the 1st 24 h of patients in Group A and B is significantly smaller, as well as total postoperative volumes of drainage (*p* < 0.05) during their hospital stay. The drainage volumes in the 2nd 24 h were similar in the 3 groups. We also found that the average drainage Hematocrit (HCT) reduced over time, the average HCT of drainage is 18.04% and 11.72% on the first day and on the second day respectively. ## Trial registration The trial registration number (TRN) of the study is [ISRCTN29254316](#) and date of registration is 25/10/2016. # Results In this study, 92 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Among these patients, 30 patients were assigned to group A, 30 patients were assigned to group B and 32 patients were assigned to group C.

      "# Abstract ## Background New graduates report intense stress during the transition from school to their 1st work settings. This study compared the effects of an externship program and 1 corporate academic cooperation program on enhancing junior college students' nursing competence and retention rates in the first 3 months and 1 year of initial employment*. * ## Methods This 2 phase study adopted a pretest and posttest quasi experimental design. All participants were graduating students drawn from a 5-year junior nursing college in Taiwan. There were 19 and 24 students who participated in the phase I externship program and phase II corporate academic cooperation program, respectively. The nursing competence of the students had to be evaluated by mentors within 48 hours of practicum training and after practicum training. The retention rate was also surveyed at 3 months and 1 year after beginning employment. ## Results Students who participated in the corporate academic cooperation program achieved a statistically significant improvement in nursing competence and retention rates relative to those who participated in the externship program (*p <* 0.01 and *p <* 0.05, respectively). # Results ## Baseline characteristics of hospitals and mentors In the EP and CACP groups, 19 and 24 students were enrolled and 19 and 23 students completed the programs, respectively. At baseline, the hospital characteristics and demographics of the mentors in the 2 groups were examined by chi squared analysis and independent t tests to ensure homogeneity. Table [1](#) shows that there were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the 2 groups. However, 39.5% and 60.5% of the graduating students were placed at the medical center and regional teaching hospitals for the practicum, respectively. Most students were trained in medical wards (51.2%). 43 RNs participated in this program as mentors and were characterized as follows: mean age of 28.86 years (SD= 2.51), most were college educated (33, 76.8%) and single (29, 67.5%), and the average number of working years as a nurse and average tenure in the present ward were 6.28 and 5.47 years, respectively.table wrap\n",

All 6 subscale scores in the EP group were lower than 50.0% of the possible score, ranging from 31.1% (T/C) to 47.2% (PD). The CACP group, in contrast, ranged from 43.7% (T/C) to 64.2% (PD). The 3 variables with the lowest percentages of total scores across the 6 subscales for the EP group were T/C, P/E and CC, and the scores on these 3 subscales relative to the possible score ranged from 31.1 to 37.0%. The rankings on the 6 subscales were comparable for the EP and CACP groups. However, students in the CACP group exhibited higher scores than students in the EP group for the total nursing competence score and in the 6 subscales.

Table [2](#) shows that the CACP group achieved higher scores than the EP group following practicum training (T1) across all 6 subscales. For further comparisons, we used the baseline levels of the 6 nursing competence subscales as covariates for control the baseline variation of 2 groups. The MANCOVA test revealed a significant difference in the mean scores of the EP and CACP groups across the 6 subscales at T1 (Wilks' lambda: *F* = 4.000, d.f. = 6, *p* = 0.005), and a comparison of the mean scores for every subscale at T1 revealed significant differences between the 2 groups: CC (*p* = 0.005), T/C (*p* = 0.000), P/E (*p* = 0.000), IPR/C (*p* = 0.000), PD (*p* = 0.002) and leadership (*p* = 0.000). Furthermore, based on pairwise MANCOVA comparisons with the baseline levels of the 6 nursing competence subscales applied as covariates, the mean difference of CACP and EP groups at T1 (e.g., differences in total nursing competence scores, including all 6 subscale scores in these 2 groups at T1) also showed significant differences (Table [2](#), the last column), and the power of the study to detect the multivariate effect of 2 trial groups was 0.933. Besides, we also noted that group discrepancy was apparent in the \"top 3\" ranking in terms of percentage of change (i.e., the mean difference of T1-T0 divided by the total subscale score) across the 6 subscales. In the EP group, the T/C, P/E and CC subscales showed the highest improvement; however, the \"top 3\" rankings in the CACP group were the P/E, IPR/C and CC subscales. After practicum training, 19 students (100%) remained in the EP group and 23 (95.8%) remained in the CACP group, and most of the students were engaged in a clinical job. In the EP group, 10 students remained in the hospital for 3 months after beginning employment, and only 8 students remained employed 1 year after beginning employment. 3 months and 1 year after beginning employment, the retention rates were 52.6% and 42.1% for the EP group and 91.7% and 79.2% for the CACP group, respectively.

      "Use of 1 drainage method to protect the suture line from leakage is a matter of controversy. ## Patients and Methods: 82 patients with UPJO were evaluated from 1996 to 2002. The follow up of patients was planned weekly, with patient visits and urine analysis and intravenous pyelography (IVP) and diethylene triamine pentaacetate (DTPA) scan after 1 month. ## Results: The study group consisted of 51 male and 31 female patients, who were mostly in the age range of 20 - 40 years. Comparing the 2 techniques of pyeloplasty with or without internal drainage, there was no significant difference between groups regarding extravasation and anastomosis complications, such as leakage, stenosis, urinoma formation or evidence of obstruction on postoperative IVP or DTPA scan. # 4. Results Double stenting was used in 30 cases and pyeloplasty without internal drainage was performed in 52 patients. The most common symptom was severe flank pain, which was present in 69% of patients. History of urinary tract infection was detected in 47% and 51% reported associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Pyuria was seen in 58% and only 36% of patients had positive urine culture, with *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) as the most common pathogen (60%). The preoperative sonographic evaluation and IVP results are shown in [Table 1](#). Intraoperative assessments showed ureteropelvic junction segmental atresia in 45 cases and aberrant vessels in 25 patients. The postoperative course was compared in 2 groups of patients, with and without internal drainage ([Table 2](#)). Among patients with extravasation in DTPA scan in the stent free group, retrograde DJ stent was inserted in 4 cases that had unacceptable drainage due to inflammation. 1 patient had distal ureter obstruction because of distal ureter stone, that was treated by Trans ureteral lithotripsy (TULP) and stent support. 3 other cases had no anatomical abnormality, and they were followed and extravasation resolved spontaneously at control IVP after 1 month. Removal of DJ stent was planned in 1 month after operation. However, 8 cases missed the time and late stent removal was accompanied with several complications, such as stone formation on the tip of catheter in the bladder of a patient that needed TULP before stent removal.table wrap\n",

      "This study sought to identify which dose of haloperidol 1mg or 2mg could be combined with dexamethasone without adverse effects in high risk patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery. ## Methods Female adults (*n* = 150) with 3 established PONV risk factors based on Apfel's score were randomized into 1 of 3 study groups. At the end of anesthesia, groups H0, H1, and H2 were given intravenous (IV) saline, haloperidol 1 mg, and haloperidol 2 mg, respectively. All patients were given dexamethasone 5 mg during the induction of anesthesia. The overall early (0--2 h) and late (2--24 h) incidences of nausea, vomiting, rescue anti emetic administration, pain, and adverse effects (cardiac arrhythmias and extrapyramidal effects) were assessed postoperatively. ## Results The total incidence of PONV over 24 h was significantly lower in groups H1 (29 %) and H2 (24 %) than in group H0 (54 %; *P* = 0.003), but there was no significant difference between groups H1 and H2. In the PACU, group H2 had 1 higher sedation score than groups H1 and H0 (*P* < 0.001). ## Conclusions For high risk PONV patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery, when used with dexamethasone, 1-mg haloperidol was equally effective as 2 mg in terms of preventing PONV with the less sedative effect. ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov ([NCT01639599](#)). # Results Of the 150 patients registered for the study, 1 was excluded due to an intra operative conversion to laparotomy (Fig. [1](#)). The remaining 149 patients, consisting of 50, 49, and 50 patients in groups H0, H1, and H2, respectively, completed the study.

      "## Methods 1 website about Hepatitis A, B, and C virus infections was used in a preparatory lab based eye tracking study assessing whether social presence elements attract participants' attention, because this is a prerequisite for affecting website use. In the following field study, 482 participants representative of the Dutch population were randomized to either a website with or a website without social presence elements. ## Results Participants in the experimental condition focused on the social presence elements, both in terms of frequency (*F*(1, 98) = 40.34, *p*<.001) and duration (*F*(1, 88) = 39.99, *p*<.001), but did not differ in website use in comparison with the control condition; neither in terms of the number of pages visited (*t*(456) = 1.44, *p* = .15), nor in terms of time on the website (*t*(456) = 0.01, *p* = .99). # Results ## Participants Of those 982 potential participants that were invited, 458 participated in the study (47%).1/2 of the participants were female and the mean age of participants was 49 years (*SD* = 16). Of the participants, 30% had a low level of highest completed education (equivalent to primary school/junior high school), 38% an intermediate level (equivalent to senior high school/junior college), and 32% a high level (equivalent to college/university). Those 458 that participated were invited to complete the follow up measure and 402 of them did so (88%). There was no selective dropout regarding gender (χ2 (1, N = 458) = 0.3, *p* = .57), level of education (χ2 = 5.0, *p* = .08), or Hepatitis knowledge at baseline (*t*(456) = 1.83, *p* = .07). Furthermore, dropout did not differ between the 2 conditions (χ2 (1, N = 458) = 3.2, *p* = .08). Those who dropped out, however, were younger (*M* = 43 vs 50 years, (*t*(456) = 3.19, *p* = .002). ## Manipulation check Participants in the experimental condition scored higher on perceived social presence than the control condition (*M* = 4.9 vs. 4.4, *t*(456) = 4.11, *p*<.001, Cohen's d = 0.38), which indicates that the manipulation did succeed. ## Website use and Hepatitis knowledge Participants in the experimental condition did not differ in website use in comparison with the control condition; neither in terms of the number of pages visited, nor in terms of time on the website ([Table 1](#)). Thus, there is no support for Hypothesis 1. The increase in Hepatitis knowledge between pre test and post test did not differ between both conditions (*F*(1, 400) = 0.72, *p* = .40), but there was a significant increase regarding Hepatitis knowledge between pre test and post test across conditions (*M* = 6.4 vs. 8.3, *F*(1,400) = 172.98, *p*<.001, Cohen's d = 0.65), which can be defined as a moderate effect size.table wrap\n",

[Figure 5](#) illustrates the final structural equation model testing the associations between user perceptions and website use across conditions, because there were no differences on both measures of website use. The final model is mostly in line with Hypothesis 2: Efficiency (*M* = 6.5, *SD* = 0.84), effectiveness (*M* = 6.4, *SD* = 0.87), and enjoyment (*M* = 5.6, *SD* = 1.21) were positively associated with website use and these associations were partly mediated by active trust (*M* = 5.8, *SD* = 1.23). Since there were no differences between conditions in terms of website use, there is neither support for Hypothesis 3a nor for Hypothesis 3b. Interest (*M* = 5.9, *SD* = 1.06), however, was positively associated with and contributed to explaining variance in website use besides efficiency, effectiveness, enjoyment, and active trust. The explained variance (R^2^) of the number of pages visited and time on the website is .63 and .51 respectively.

      "# Abstract Cervical degenerative disease is 1 of the most common spinal disorders worldwide, especially in older people. Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) is 1 useful method for the surgical treatment of multi level cervical degenerative disease. 32 goats were randomly divided into 4 groups: a sham control group, an ACVC group, an ACVC HA group, and an ACCF group (titanium and plate fixation group). We compared the clinical, radiological, biomechanical, and histological outcomes among these 4 different groups for 24 weeks post surgery. Similar results were found after a fatigue test of 5,000 repetitions of axial rotation. # Results ## Design of different artificial cervical joints [Fig 1](#) shows photographs of the ACVC ([Fig 1B](#)), the ACVC HA ([Fig 1C](#)), and the titanium cage and the anterior plate ([Fig 1D](#)) implants. The ball in trough structure ([Fig 1A-7 and 1A-8](#)) is the most important part of this unconstrained metal on metal ACVC joint. In theory, the ball in trough articulation allows a 20° ROM in flexion extension, a 12° ROM in lateral bending, a 360° ROM in rotation, and a 1.5-mm anterior posterior slide horizontally. The ACVC HA is an ACVC treated with a 30-μm hydroxyapatite biocoating via microarc oxidation technology. The titanium cage was 8 mm wide and could be cut to a suitable length. Because the vertebral bodies of goats are much longer than those of humans, 4 to 8 screws could be used to fix the plate and the cage. Surgery time, blood loss, recovery time, and time before eating are shown in [Table 1](#).table wrap\n",

      "groups.All goats survived until 24 weeks after surgery. 1 goat in the ACVC group and 2 goats in the ACCF group developed wound infections 8 to 12 days after surgery. 1 goat in the ACVC HA group and another goat in the ACCF group suffered respiratory infections and recovered by using antibiotics. [Fig 2](#) shows the CT images of goats in the 3 different groups 24 weeks after surgery. In the ACVC group, the implant was properly located in the C3 vertebral body ([Fig 2B](#)). The vertebral body component of the ACVC was located in the middle of the C3 vertebral body ([Fig 2E](#)). The 2 lower screws were fixed to the C4 vertebral body ([Fig 2H](#)). The titanium cage was located between C2 and C4. The vertebral bodies from C2 to C4 were fixed by the plate ([Fig 2C](#)). The titanium cage was located in the trough of the C3 vertebral body ([Fig 2F](#)). The anterior plate was fixed by 3 screws to the C2 vertebral body and by 3 additional screws to the C4 vertebral body ([Fig 2I](#)). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0178775.g002 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>CT images of goats in control group, ACVC group, ACCF group 24 weeks after the surgery (ACVC and ACVC HA appears similar).<br /> A, B, C, Lateral views of C2 to C4 for the 3 groups; D, G, transverse views of C3 and C4 vertebral bodies in control group; E, H, transverse views of C3 and C4 vertebral bodies in ACVC group; F, I, transverse views of C3 and C4 vertebral bodies in ACCF group.</figcaption> </figure> ## Biomechanical results of the different prosthesis implantations in goats To investigate the cervical spine ROM separately, we used the 3 dimensional laser optoelectronic camera system ([Table 2](#)). There were no significant differences among the control, ACVC, and ACVC HA groups inflexion extension and lateral bending for the C2-C6, C2-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 segments. The rotation ROM of the ACVC and ACVC HA groups were greater than the ROM of the control group for the C2-C6 and C2-C4 segments. Accordingly, the ROM in rotation decreased in the ACVC and ACVC HA groups for the C4-C5 and C5-C6 segments. For the C2-C6 and C2-C4 segments, the ROM was less for the ACCF group than for the control group in all 3 directions. Accordingly, the ROM of the C4-C5 segment in all 3 directions and the ROM of the C5-C6 segment in rotation increased in the ACCF group.table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract Hepatitis C virus genotype 2 (HCV-2) slow responders poorly respond to 24 weeks of peginterferon (Peg IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). We evaluated the efficacy of extended 48-week regimen and the role of interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype in this clinical setting. Treatment naïve HCV-2 patients not achieving rapid virologic response (RVR) by Peg IFN alfa-2a 180 μg/week plus weight based RBV (1,000--1,200 mg/day, cutoff body weight of 75 kg) were randomly assigned to receive 1 total duration of 48 (n = 94) or 24 (n = 93) weeks of therapy. Patients receiving 48 weeks of treatment had a greater SVR rate than those receiving 24 weeks of treatment (70.2% versus 46.2%, *P* = 0.001). Compared to patients treated for 24 weeks, the SVR rate in those treated for 48 weeks increased by 10.9% [95% CI: −5.9% to 27.7%] and 65.6% [95% CI: 44.5% to 86.7%] if they had IL-28B rs8099917 TT genotype, and GT/GG genotype, respectively (interaction *P* = 0.002). In conclusion, 48-week treatment with Peg IFN plus weight based RBV provides a greater SVR rate than 24-week treatment in treatment naïve HCV-2 patients with unfavorable IL-28B genotypes who fail to achieve RVR. # Results ## Patient Characteristics Among the 190 patients not achieving RVR by Peg IFN plus weight based RBV therapy, 187 were allocated to a total duration of 48-week (n = 94) or 24-week (n = 93) therapy. 74 (78.7%) and 80 (86.0%) patients assigned to 48-week and 24-week therapies completed treatment, and 87 (92.6%) and 88 (94.6%) patients completed 24 weeks of post treatment follow up to assess the SVR rates ([Fig. 1](#)). The baseline patient characteristics were comparable between the 2 arms ([Table 1](#)).They were slim with an average BMI of 26.3--26.7 kg/m^2^.Most of the patients had high baseline viral load (62--65%) and favorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotype (71--74%), and were infected with 2a subtype (68--71%). With regard to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) score, 23.7--27.7% patients had a score of >2.00. ## Efficacy The early virologic response (EVR) (91.5% versus 88.2%, RD: 3.3% [95% CI: −5.3% to 12.0%]; *P* = 0.45) and the end of treatment virologic response (ETVR) (88.3% versus 80.6%, RD: 7.7% [95% CI: −2.7% to 18.0%]; *P* = 0.15) rates were comparable between the treatment arms. The SVR rate of 48-week treatment was greater than 24-week treatment (70.2% versus 46.2%, RD: 24.0% [95% CI: 10.3% to 37.7%]; *P* = 0.001) ([Table 2](#)). Patients with RBV cumulative exposure <60% had lower SVR rates than those with RBV cumulative exposure ≥60% in 48-week arm (77.6% versus 38.9%, *P *= 0.003) and 24-week arm (53.8% versus 6.7%, *P *= 0.001), respectively. ## Subgroup Analyses for Prespecified Factors Differences of SVR rates between patients receiving 48 and 24 weeks of treatment did not vary by baseline viral load (interaction *P* = 0.82), subgenotype (interaction *P* = 0.89), age (interaction *P* = 0.73), sex (interaction *P* = 0.94), body mass index (BMI) (interaction *P* = 0.26), APRI score (interaction *P* = 0.83) or RBV cumulative exposure (interaction *P *= 0.48) ([Table 3](#)). Compared to patients with favorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotype (69.2% versus 58.3%, risk difference (RD): 10.9% [95% CI: −5.9% to 27.7%]), patients with unfavorable IL-28B rs8099917 genotypes receiving 48-week therapy achieved a greater SVR rate than 24-week therapy (73.9% versus 8.3%, RD: 65.6% [95% CI: 44.5% to 86.7%]; interaction *P* = 0.002). The SVR rates of 48-week and 24-week treatment were similar when the patients had BMI >30 kg/m^2^ (52.6% versus 50.0%, RD: 2.6% [95% CI: −33.5% to 38.8%]). ## Safety The constitutional and laboratory adverse events (AEs) were similar between the 2 arms ([Table 4](#)). 4 and 3 patients in 48-week and 24-week arms had serious AEs during treatment (4.3% versus 3.2%, RD: 1.1% [95% CI: −4.4% to 6.5%]. The AE related withdrawal rates were 11.7% in 48-week treatment arm and 6.5% in 24-week treatment arm (RD: 5.2% [95% CI: 2.9% to 13.5%]). The rates of anemia beyond week 6 of treatment were 44.7% and 34.4% (RD: 10.3% [95% CI: −3.7% to 24.2%].:::\n",

      "## Methods 120 patients with ASA physical status were enrolled with age between 18 and 70 years. Patients were divided randomly into 4 groups of 30 patients: group P received placebo, group E received etoricoxib 120 mg, group D received duloxetine 60 mg and group D/E received duloxetine 60 mg capsules and etoricoxib 120 mg; 1 h before surgery and 24 h after. ## Results Neither Duloxetine nor etoricoxib individually had effect on pain with movement, while their combination revealed 1 significant reduction in pain scores over the entire postoperative period at rest and on movement. Etoricoxib showed a significant decrease in pain at all times at rest when compared with group P, while it showed significant pain decrease only at 0, 2 and 4 h when compared with group D. On the other hand duloxetine alone showed significant decrease in pain at rest at 24 h and 48 h when compared with group P. ConcerningMorphine requirement after 24 h.; it wassignificantly lower in the D/E group in comparison with groups P, E and D. It should be noted also that there was a significant decrease morphine requirement in both groups E and D. ## Conclusion The perioperative administration of the combination of etoricoxib and duloxetine improved analgesia and reduced opioid consumption without significant side effects. ## Trial registration [ ISRCTN48329522](#). 17 June 2017 # Results From November 1, 2015 to March 1, 2017, 131 consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria were allocated for the study (Fig. [1](#)). 11 patients refused to participate.

      "# Abstract ## Background Poor sanitation is thought to be 1 major cause of enteric infections among young children. India's Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) is 1 such program that seeks to end the practice of open defecation by changing social norms and behaviors, and providing technical support and financial subsidies. ## Methods and Findings We conducted a cluster randomized, controlled trial in 80 rural villages. Field staff collected baseline measures of sanitation conditions, behaviors, and child health (May -July 2009), and revisited households 21 months later (February -April 2011) after the program was delivered. The study enrolled a random sample of 5,209 children <5 years old from 3,039 households that had at least 1 child <24 months at the beginning of the study. A random subsample of 1,150 children <24 months at enrollment were tested for soil transmitted helminth and protozoan infections in stool. The intervention increased percentage of households in a village with improved sanitation facilities as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme by an average of 19% (95% CI for difference: 12% -26%; group means: 22% control versus 41% intervention), decreased open defecation among adults by an average of 10% (95% CI for difference: 4% -15%; group means: 73% intervention versus 84% control). Limitations of the study included a relatively short follow up period following implementation, evidence for contamination in 10 of the 40 control villages, and bias possible in self reported outcomes for diarrhea, HCGI, and open defecation behaviors. ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01465204](#) *Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary* # Results ## Enrolment, Baseline Balance, and Attrition [Figure 2](#) depicts the study participants flow. The baseline survey enrolled a sample of 3,390 children <5 years from 1,954 households from 80 villages. In the follow up survey the sample size was increased to 5,209 children <5 years from 3,039 households. As reported in [Table 2](#), baseline covariates in intervention and control groups were well balanced with 4 exceptions. 1st, 89% of the households in the intervention group had access to improved water sources --tap/piped water, tube well and protected dug wells --compared to 80% of households in the control group. In contrast, a larger proportion of control households (54%) were observed to have soap and water at hand washing locations used after defecation than in intervention households (44%). On average, more children were found to be anemic in the control group (93%) than in the intervention group (88%). Finally, average height for age Z scores were also slightly imbalanced (−1.38 intervention versus −1.81 control).table wrap\n",

Attrition was not differential by randomized group on the basis of observable characteristics (see [Table S1](#)). Of the 1,954 households enrolled at the baseline, 1,655 were located at the 21-month follow up survey (15% attrition) without any significant difference between the intervention (16%) and the control (15%) groups. Out of 40 intervention villages, staff collected administrative information on 39 villages from the TSC Block coordinators (government officers). The coordinators reported that 15/39 intervention villages received some CLTS activities, 33/39 villages applied for a NGP award prior to the follow up survey. According to Block coordinators' records, 25/39 villages had 100% households with IHLs, 11/39 villages had 80% -99% households with IHLs, and 3 of 39 villages with 37% -68% households with IHLs. Block coordinators also reported that 21/39 villages received 100% of the funds allocated under the TSC program, 12/39 villages received between 50% and 99%, and 6 of 39 villages received <50% of their allocated funds. The latest disbursement of the TSC funds was given to 36/39 intervention villages at least 4 to 5 months before the follow up survey, which would offer sufficient time for IHLs to be constructed and used for 3 or more months. The study review meetings with Block coordinators also identified that some control villages were contaminated during the study period: TSC activities were initiated in 8 control villages within a few months of baseline survey and possibly in 2 additional control villages a few months prior to the follow up survey; official records were not available for control villages to ascertain this information objectively. As per the follow up survey in these 10 contaminated villages, the household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities increased from 17.4% at baseline to 41.4% at the follow up, which is similar to the program effect we observed in the intervention group. The household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities in uncontaminated control villages increased from 10.7% to 16.2% in the same period. The study's long follow up period (21 months) and the highly publicized and politicized nature of the TSC program may have contributed to this contamination. We also found that households in intervention villages were more aware of CLTS activities, had higher knowledge of TSC, and experienced more personal visits to convince them to build and use IHLs ([Table 3](#)).table wrap\n",

      "following guidance from Schulz and Grimes [[43]](#). ## IHL Coverage and Sanitation Related Behaviors [Table 3](#) reports the intervention's effect on IHL availability (JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and any type of IHLs) and open defecation behaviors by household members. The intervention increased the coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facility by average 19 percentage points (95% CI 12% -26%; *p* value<0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (41.4% intervention versus 22.6% control). The intervention increased the coverage of any type of IHL facility by 20 percentage points (95% CI 13% -27%; *p* value<0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (44.1% intervention versus 24.2% control). Although on average fewer households in intervention villages were likely to report daily open defecation compared to control villages for adult men (75% intervention versus 84% control; mean difference: 9.5%; *p* value = 0.001), adult women (73% intervention versus 83% control; mean difference: 10%; *p* value<0.001), and children <5 years (84% intervention versus 89% control; mean difference: 5%; *p* value = 0.014), these reductions in reported open defecation behaviors were smaller than the gains in IHL availability. Amongst the 630 households in intervention villages that had JMP defined improved sanitation facilities at follow up, 41% reported that adult men or women still practiced daily open defecation; this same figure was 28% among the 339 control village households at follow up (not reported in results table). ## Drinking Water Quality In control villages, 82% (331/403) of household drinking water samples tested positive for *E. coli* compared to 77% (310/404) of samples in intervention villages (mean difference: 5.5%; *p* value = 0.050) ([Table 3](#)). [Table S2](#) lists the distribution of positive household samples by different *E. coli* contamination level categories. Of 511 water source samples tested, 74% (208/280) of the sources in control villages and 70% (162/231) in intervention villages tested positive for *E. coli* but the difference was not statistically significant (*p* value = 0.143). ## Caregiver Reported Illness Diarrhea prevalence did not differ between groups (7.4% intervention versus 7.7% control; *p* value = 0.687) ([Table 4](#)). HCGI prevalence also did not differ between groups (11.5% intervention versus 12.0% control; *p* value = 0.692) ([Table 4](#)). We observed no significant differences between groups in negative control caregiver reported outcomes including bruising/abrasions (1.4% intervention versus 1.3% control) and itchy skin/scalp (2.5% intervention versus 2.2% control) suggesting that differential outcome reporting bias for diarrhea and HCGI was unlikely.table wrap\n",

We detected no *Cryptosporidium* infections in the study children, and a low prevalence of *E. histolytica* (33 out of 1,150; 2.9%). ## Anemia and Anthropometry Anemia was prevalent in the study children (54%) and children were small according to international growth standards ([Table 4](#)). ## Subgroup Results [Table 5](#) presents the results of subgroup analyses of the effect of the intervention on households with or without any type of IHL at baseline and BPL or non BPL households. Among BPL households, the intervention increased JMP defined improved sanitation facilities coverage by 30 percentage points (48% intervention versus 18% control; *p* value<0.001) and it reduced open defecation among women by 17 percentage points (73% intervention versus 90% control; *p* value<0.001).

      "# Abstract Our aim was to study the expression of adipokine encoding genes (leptin, adiponectin, and angiopoietin like protein 4 (ANGPTL4)) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and adipokine concentration in cord blood from women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) depending on glycaemic targets. GDM patients were randomised to 2 groups per target glycaemic levels: GDM1 (tight glycaemic targets, fasting blood glucose < 5.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L postprandial, *N* = 20) and GDM2 (less tight glycaemic targets, <5.3 mmol/L and < 7.8 mmol/L, respectively, *N* = 21). The control group included 25 women with normal glucose tolerance. ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; *p* < 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2. In cord blood, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) was increased in GDM2 compared to controls and GDM1 ( *p* = 0.038) and did not differ between GDM1 and controls. ANGPTL4 expression was downregulated in HUVECs of newborns from GDM mothers and was not affected by the intensity of glycaemic control. # 3. Results ## 3.1. Characteristics of the Participants Baseline characteristics of the participants are described in [Table 1](#) . The women from all 3 groups did not differ in terms of age and prepregnancy BMI. The GDM1 group had higher diastolic BP compared to controls ( *p* = 0.003). The GDM1 and GDM2 groups had higher levels of fasting PG ( *p* = 0.004 and *p* = 0.003, resp.) and higher levels of PG 1 h and 2 h in OGTT ( *p* < 0.001 in comparison with controls). Mean levels of fasting, 1-hour postprandial and average blood glucose measured by the participants during the study are described in [Table 2](#) . The GDM1 group achieved significantly lower average and 1-hour postprandial glucose levels compared to GDM2. Mean postprandial BG was lower in GDM1 even compared to the control group, though the difference did not reach statistical significance ( *p* = 0.088). Gestational weight gain did not differ between GDM1 and GDM2 groups and was lower in both groups compared to controls ( [Table 2](#) ). The percentage of women treated with insulin was 40% and 29% in the GDM1 and GDM2 groups, respectively, and did not significantly differ ( *p* = 0.495). ## 3.2. Pregnancy Outcomes Pregnancy outcomes and biochemical markers in cord blood are shown in [Table 3](#) . There was no statistically significant difference among the groups in terms of pregnancy outcomes (percent of large for gestational age (LGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) newborns, delivery by caesarean section) and the level of C peptide, adiponectin, and ANGPTL4 in cord blood serum and glucose in cord blood plasma. The level of leptin in cord blood serum was higher in the GDM2 group than in the GDM1 ( *p* = 0.036) and the control group, but the difference from the control group did not reach statistical significance ( *p* = 0.066). After adjustment by insulin therapy, age, and prepregnancy BMI, the difference in the level of leptin between GDM1 and GDM2 remained significant ( *p* = 0.01). The leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) in cord blood serum was higher in the GDM2 group compared to controls ( *p* = 0.011) with no difference between the GDM1 and control group ( *p* = 0.404). ## 3.3. All samples demonstrated characteristic endothelial morphology and immunophenotype CD45−/CD144+/CD31+/CD146+/CD105+ and stained positively for endothelial markers, von Willebrand factor, and CD146 (as demonstrated in our previous work [ [20](#) ]). ## 3.4. Gene Expression in HUVECs ANGPTL4 expression was downregulated in the HUVECs derived from GDM patients compared to control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 0.92, respectively, for GDM1, GDM2, and control groups; *p* < 0.001 for comparison among the 3 groups) while no difference between GDM1 and GDM2 groups was observed ( [Figure 1(1)](#) ). We did not detect the expression of LEP in HUVEC but found out that they expressed LEPR, and the expression of LEPR demonstrated a decline in the GDM1/GDM2 groups compared to the control group, though the differences were not statistically significant ( [Figure 1(c)](#) ). The expression of LEPR did not correlate with the level of LEP in cord plasma ( [Figure 1(d)](#) ) which indicates that there is no reciprocal regulation between LEP and its receptor in HUVECs. The expression of ADIPOQ was detected in HUVEC samples, but the level of its expression was as low as in negative control samples and lower by 4 orders of magnitude in HUVEC compared to adipocytes (positive control) ( [Figure 1(b)](#) ). - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  GDM 1 GDM2 Control *p* ( *N* = 20) ( *N* = 21) ( *N* = 25) - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - - -- -- -- -- --  - -- -- -- -- --  - -- -- -- --  - -- -- Gestational age at delivery, weeks 39.2 ± 1.5 39.3 ± 1.0 39.7 ± 1.0 0.261 Caesarean section, % ( *N* ) 30% (6) 19% (4) 20% (5) 0.723 Birth weight, g 3572 ± 488 3584 ± 577 3513 ± 555 0.856 Height, cm 52.1 ± 2.5 52.4 ± 2.3 52.1 ± 2.5 0.990 LGA, % ( *N* ) 20% (4) 23% (5) 12% (3) 0.235 SGA, % ( *N* ) 5% (1) 9.5% (2) 4% (1) 0.819 Apgar score 1 min 7.5 ± 0.7 7.7 ± 1.1 7.7 ± 0.6 0.204 Apgar score 5 min 8.6 ± 0.5 8.7 ± 0.9 8.8 ± 0.4 0.208 Glucose, mmol/L 4.7 ± 1.2 5.3 ± 1.3 4.5 ± 1.2 0.203 C peptide, ng/mL 0.8 ± 0.5 1.0 ± 0.6 0.9 ± 0.4 0.379 Leptin, ng/mL 8.8 ± 6.6 ^a^ 18.3 ± 16.1 10.6 ± 10.4 0.042 Adiponectin, ng/mL 15.9 ± 11.5 16.3 ± 14.4 18.3 ± 14.3 0.843 LAR 0.97 ± 1.31 1.70 ± 1.66 ^b^ 0.72 ± 0.46 0.038 ANGPTL4 in cord serum, ng/mL 19.9 ± 15.0 14.1 ± 4.5 13.9 ± 5.2 0.248 ANGPTL4 relative expression in HUVECs 23.1 ± 25.6 ^c^ 21.5 ± 25.8 ^c^ 98.3 ± 104.6 0.001 - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  Notes: LAR: leptin/adiponectin ratio; LGA: large for gestational age; SGA: small for gestational age.

      "1 stratified cluster randomized trial in 42 communities in Enugu state compared 3 scenarios: Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) with basic instruction (control); RDTs with provider training (provider arm); and RDTs with provider training plus a school based community intervention (provider school arm). The primary outcome was evaluated among 4946 (93%) of the 5311 patients invited to participate. A total of 40 communities (12 in control, 14 per intervention arm) were included in the analysis. There was no evidence of differences between the 3 arms in terms of our composite indicator (p = 0.36): stratified risk difference was 14% (95% CI -8.3%, 35.8%; p = 0.26) in the provider arm and 1% (95% CI -21.1%, 22.9%; p = 0.19) in the provider school arm, compared with control. The level of testing was low across all arms (34% in control; 48% provider arm; 37% provider school arm; p = 0.47). ## Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01350752](#) # Results The trial profile is provided in [Fig 2](#). The study took place between 6^th^ June and 19^th^ December 2011. A total of 42 clusters (14 per arm) were randomised and 40 (12 in control, 14 per intervention arm) were included in the analysis. 2 clusters in the control arm were not included in the analysis because no patients visited these health facilities. The primary outcome was evaluated among 4946 (93%) of the 5311 patients invited to participate in the study. <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0133832.g002 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Trial profile.</figcaption> </figure> ## Process evaluation Of the 137 facilities that were invited and agreed to participate in the trial, 113 (82%; 125 providers) were represented at the RDT demonstration or provider training. The training workshops were successfully delivered, with 112/125 (90%) of participants strongly agreeing that they were satisfied with the delivery of the course by the trainers and the relevance of the material to their work. Participants' knowledge of topics covered in the material increased from 59% to 82% (as measured by the pre post training test). In the intervention arms 71/79 (90%) facilities received support visits, due to closure of some facilities on the visit days. A total of 109 teachers from 59 schools were initially trained on peer health education and holding community events. Teachers from 57 schools subsequently trained 510 children as PHEs. 27 schools held a malaria event with considerable variation in terms of the range of activities undertaken, attendance (80 to 400 community members) and duration (1 to 4 hours). The evaluation of pre and post tests for training of school teachers showed an increase in knowledge from 12% to 50%. 3 facilities in each of the provider (6%) and control (7%) arm reported stock outs of RDTs in the 4 weeks prior to the provider survey compared to 1 facility (2%) in the provider school arm. All facilities procured ACT through the usual channels with third3 of facilities in the provider (32%) and provider school (33%) arms reporting stock outs in the 4 weeks before the provider survey compared with 16% in control. Stock outs of ACT mainly occurred in public facilities (86%) compared with pharmacies (5%) and drug stores (23%) due to an unexpected break in supply from the Central Medical Stores to public facilities. ## Characteristics of the study population The stratification and restricted randomisation were shown to have provided study arms that were generally similar in their characteristics with a few exceptions ([Table 1](#)).table wrap\n",

The observed agreement between the readings from the independent testing by the study team and the malaria registers was also excellent (96%; κ = 0.93). ## Impact on provider and community knowledge There was no evidence of a difference by arm in the proportion of providers who knew the treatment guidelines or reported they would not give an antimalarial for test negative cases ([Table 4](#)). Almost all providers knew that febrile patients should be tested for malaria although a markedly higher proportion of providers in the intervention arms reported that they would give an ACT if a malaria test was positive (83% in control, 98% in provider arm and 99% in provider school arm).table wrap\n",

      "Male athletes were randomly divided in 2 groups; both received the same training, including strength training for knee extensors and flexors, in addition to horizontal plyometric training drills. The only difference between groups was the mode of drills technique: unilateral (UG; *n* = 9; age, 17.3 ± 1.1 years) vs. bilateral (TG; *n* = 9; age, 17.6 ± 0.5 years). 1 repetition maximum bilateral strength of knee muscle extensors (1RM_KE) and flexors (1RM_KF), change of direction ability (COD), horizontal and vertical jump ability with 1 (unilateral) and 2 (bilateral) legs, and limb symmetry index were measured before and after an 8-week in season intervention period. Beneficial effects ( *p* < 0.05) in 1RM_KE, COD, and several test of jumping performance were found in both groups in comparison to pre test values. The beneficial changes in 1RM_KE (8.1%; *p* = 0.074) and 1RM_KF (6.7%; *p* = 0.004), COD (3.1%; *p* = 0.149), and bilateral jump performance (from 2.7% [ *p* = 0.535] to 10.5% [ *p* = 0.002]) were *possible* to *most likely* beneficial in the TG than in the UG.

      "## Methods We evaluated the glycemic profile in response to 4 h infusion of 500 ml of 0.9% saline versus 5% glucose solution with and without quinine at therapeutic dose (500 mg) in 10 healthy volunteers (8 men) aged 28 ± 9 years. The order of the 4th explorations was randomly assigned. During these explorations, we measured blood glucose every 15 min for 4 h and compared the mean and glycemic fluctuations for each test. 1 resting ECG was performed before and after quinine infusion in each participant. ## Results The mean glycemic level during the 4-h infusion was 83 ± 5 mg/dl without quinine versus 74 ± 5 ​​mg/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) using saline solute versus 92 ± 7 mg/dl without quinine versus 82 ± 5 mg/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) when associated with the glucose solute. In isotonic dirty solute, quinine induces a cumulative glycemic decrease of 17.5% (p = 0.01) characterized by a nadir estimated at −26.5% at the 60th minute (65 ± 23 mg/dl), p <0.001 followed by a gradual increase until the 4th hour. ## Conclusion The intravenous infusion of quinine at a therapeutic dose induces a light drop in blood glucose with a significant nadir at the 60th minute in the healthy subject without hypoglycemia. ## Plasma glucose The mean capillary glycemia during 4 h of infusion were 0.83 ± 0.05, 0.92 ± 0.07, 0.74 ± 0.05 and 0.82 ± 0.05 g/l on normal saline, dextrose 5%, normal saline containing quinine and dextrose 5% containing quinine respectively. On the other hand, the matched mean venous glycemia were 0.97 ± 0.02, 0.99 ± 0.35, 0.97 ± 0.06 and 0.93 ± 0.40 g/l, respectively. On comparing the mean capillary glucose, there was a statistically significant difference between mean glucose levels on isotonic saline and those on isotonic dextrose (p < 0.001). The ratio of the area under curve for saline and saline plus quinine infusions was 89%; thus a decrease in blood sugar of 11% induced by quinine over 4 h. At the 60th min, the maximum glycemic drop was observed; 26.5% for quinine in isotonic saline and 7.6% for quinine in isotonic glucose (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) between mean values during the 4 h of saline infusion versus saline + quinine infusion as shown in Fig. [1](#). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Mean plasma glucose concentrations during a 4 h infusion of 500 ml of saline in healthy volunteers, with a subsequent 4 h infusion of saline with quinine 8 mg/kg body weight</figcaption> </figure> Concerning the 12 lead ECG done before and after the administration of quinine in either isotonic saline or isotonic glucose, lengthening of the QT interval was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).\n",
      "## Methods Using data from 1 recent randomized trial comparing daptomycin with standard therapy (semi synthetic penicillin or vancomycin, each with initial low dose gentamicin) for *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteraemia and infective endocarditis (SAB/IE), patient characteristics and outcomes were evaluated. ## Results Among the 200 patients, 51.5% received CoPAT. These patients were generally younger (median age 50 versus 54 years, *P* = 0.028). In the CoPAT group, there tended to be fewer patients with endocardial involvement (8.7% versus 18.6%, *P* = 0.061) and pre existing valvular heart disease (7.8% versus 15.5%, *P* = 0.120). CoPAT patients received longer therapy courses (mean 25.4 versus 13.5 days, *P* < 0.001) and had higher rates of therapy completion (90.3% versus 45.4%, *P* < 0.001) and clinical success (86.4% versus 55.7%, *P* < 0.001). *aureus* was less frequent in the CoPAT group (3.9% versus 15.5%, *P* = 0.007) and there were fewer deaths (3.9% versus 18.6%, *P* = 0.001) 6 weeks after the end of therapy. Hospital readmission occurred for 18 of the 103 (17.5%) CoPAT patients. Clinical success rates were similar for CoPAT patients receiving daptomycin (90.0%) or standard therapy (83.0%). # Results ## Patient characteristics 200 US patients were included in this analysis, with 103 (51.5%) receiving part of their treatment outside of the hospital setting (CoPAT). The majority of CoPAT patients (69/103, 67.0%) were discharged home without assistance and 2 others (1.9%) went home with assistance. 19 of the 103 CoPAT patients (18.4%) were discharged to a skilled nursing facility, while 13/103 (12.6%) were treated in an assisted living setting, nursing home or rehabilitation centre. Compared with patients who received all care in the hospital, CoPAT patients were younger (median age 50 versus 54 years, *P* = 0.028) and tended to have fewer cases of endocardial involvement (8.7% versus 18.6%; *P* = 0.061) as well as less pre existing valvular heart disease (7.8% versus 15.5%, *P* = 0.120).

For IPAT patients, clinical success was observed in 26/50 (52.0%) daptomycin patients and 28/47 (59.6%) comparator patients. CoPAT patients received longer courses of study antibiotics with a mean of 25.4 days (range 9--74 days) compared with 13.5 days (range 1--43) in the IPAT group (*P* < 0.001), and a higher proportion of CoPAT patients completed therapy as part of the study (90.3% versus 45.4%, *P* < 0.001). CoPAT patients received a mean of 14.9 days of therapy outside the hospital setting (Table [1](#)). The shorter duration of study treatment for IPAT patients was influenced by early discontinuations: there were 53 (54.6%) versus 10 (9.7%) in the CoPAT group. The most common reason for discontinuation was adverse events, which accounted for 25/53 (47.2%) IPAT and 8/10 (80.0%) CoPAT patient discontinuations.

As shown in Table [6](#), the reasons for hospital readmission were diverse. 4 patients (22.2% of the readmissions and 3.9% of CoPAT patients) were readmitted for reasons related to their initial infection, including osteomyelitis or relapsed SAB. Problems related to provision of treatment in the post acute care setting led to the readmission of 3 patients, 2 of whom relapsed with iv drug use (IVDU) and 1 of whom developed *Clostridium difficile* colitis. Other medical conditions leading to readmission included pneumonia in 3 patients and a myriad of other conditions, including unknown reasons, which were each experienced by a single patient. Of the 18 CoPAT patients readmitted to the hospital during the study,1/2 subsequently returned to treatment in the CoPAT setting.table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Aphasia affects 1/3 of acute stroke patients. There is 1 considerable spontaneous recovery in aphasia, but impaired communication ability remains a great problem. ## Methods A prospective, open, randomized, controlled trial was carried out with blinded endpoint evaluation of SLT, starting within 2 days of stroke onset and lasting for 21 days. 123 consecutive patients with acute, 1st ever ischemic stroke and aphasia were randomized. ## Results The primary outcome, as measured by ANELT at day 21, was 1.3 in the actively treated patient group and 1.2 among controls. Patients with a higher level of education (>12 years) improved more on ANELT by day 21 than those with <12 years of education (3.4 vs. 1.0, respectively). In 34 patients in the treatment group and 19 in the control group improvement was ≥1 on ANELT (p < 0.05). ## Conclusions Very early intensive SLT with the Language Enrichment Therapy program over 21 days had no effect on the degree of aphasia in unselected acute aphasic stroke patients. A higher educational level of >12 years was beneficial. # Results ## General Results We randomized 123 aphasic patients of which 114 (93%) completed the study and could be tested on day 21 (fig. [1](#)). Follow up at 6 months could be performed in 99 patients (80%). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the study groups, except for a history of myocardial infarction, which was more frequent in the intervention group (table [1](#)). At the follow up at 6 months, 5 patients in the intervention group and 6 in the control group had died. 5 patients in each group had recurrent stroke. All recurrent strokes occurred beyond the 3 weeks of intervention. ## Primary and Secondary Outcomes The primary outcome in the whole group as measured by ANELT by day 21 was 1.3 among the SLT treated patients and 1.2 among the controls (table [2](#)). The Diff Coeff was 8.5 in the SLT group and 9 in the control group. Also, per protocol analyses of ANELT by day 21 and for Diff Coeff revealed no statistical difference between the 2 study groups (table [2](#)). Patients with a higher level of education (>12 years) improved more in ANELT by day 21 than those with <12 years of education [3.4 (1.0--4.8) vs. 1.0 (1.0--2.7); p < 0.01]. Diff Coeff improved more in patients with >12 years of education than in those with <12 years of education [13 (8--26) vs. 8 (1--16); p < 0.01]. Higher values of ANELT, Coeff, fluency, and comprehension at baseline had a positive effect on ANELT by day 21 (p < 0.01), while worse neurological performance as indicated by higher NIHSS values at baseline and longer delay to inclusion had a negative effect on ANELT by day 21 (p < 0.01) and on Diff Coeff (p < 0.05). ANELT by day 21). The types of aphasia are shown in figure [2](#). There were no differences in aphasia types between the 2 groups. Only 9 patients had a fluent type of aphasia at baseline, and there were no differences in fluent/non fluent types of aphasia between the 2 groups. Best outcome according to ANELT at 3 weeks was seen in transcortical sensory aphasia, followed by isolation, conduction, and Wernicke type of aphasia. ## Follow Up at 6 Months At 6 months, ANELT and Coeff were similar in the 2 study groups (table [2](#)). The number of non study SLT sessions after day 21 was 15 (4--38) in the treatment group and 10 (5--20) in the control group (p = 0.3). ANELT at 6 months of follow up was 4.5 (1.9--5.0) among those with an education of >12 years and 1.5 (1.0--3.6) among those with less education (p < 0.01). For Coeff at 6 months, the corresponding results were 57 (39--59) and 39 (17--55) (p < 0.01). Results in the 53 aphasic stroke patients who improved ≥1 on ANELT (i.e. an improvement which was predetermined to be clinically relevant; responders) are presented in table [3](#). The 34 responders in the SLT treatment group were compared to those 25 patients who improved <1 on ANELT (non responders). NIHSS at baseline was lower in the responder group than in the non responder group [5 (2--12) vs. 11 (7--20); p < 0.01]. Aphasia tests showed no difference at baseline except for fluency, which was 37 (30--64) words/min in the responder group and 8 (1.5--30) words/min in the non responder group (p < 0.001). The responders improved in all 3 parts of the NGA (comprehension, naming, and repetition), as compared to the non responders (all p < 0.01). At 6 months of follow up, a difference in ANELT remained between responders and non responders [2.7 (1.2--4.9) vs. 1.1 (0.8--1.6); p < 0.01]. Among those with a fluency of >30 words/min (n = 51), more patients improved >1 on ANELT in the intervention group than among controls (18 vs. 6 patients; p < 0.05).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract We examined the effects of 1 10--14-weeks inpatient lifestyle modification program, including minimum 90 min of physical activity (PA) 5 days/week, on body composition, CVD risk factors, and eating behavior in 139 obese subjects (BMI 42.6 ± 5.2 kg/m ^2^ ). Completion rate was 71% ( *n* = 71) in the intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group and 85% ( *n* = 33) among waiting list controls. Compared to controls body weight (−17.0 (95% CI: −18.7, −15.3) kg, *P* < 0.0001), fat mass (−15.2 (95% CI: −17.4, −13.1) kg, *P* < 0.0001), fat free mass (−1.2 (95% CI: −2.2, −0.2) kg, *P* = 0.016) and visceral fat (−86.6(95% CI: −97.4, −75.7) cm ^2^ , *P* < 0.0001) were reduced in the ILI group after 10--14 weeks. Within the ILI group weight loss was −23.8 (95% CI: −25.9, −21.7) kg, *P* < 0.0001 and -20.3 (95% CI: −23.3, −17.3) kg, *P* < 0.0001, after 6 and 12 months, respectively. Systolic BP, glucose, triglycerides, and LDL C were reduced, and HDL C was increased (all *P* ≤ 0.006) after 10--14 weeks within the ILI group. The reduction in glucose and increase in HDL C were sustained after 12 months (all *P* < 0.0001). After 1 year, weight loss was related to increased cognitive restraint and decreased uncontrolled eating (all *P* < 0.05). # 3. Results ## 3.1. Baseline Characteristics Baseline characteristics of the participants who completed the study are shown in [Table 1](#) . The ILI group was older than the control group, but no other significant differences between the 2 study groups were seen at baseline. ## 3.2. Between Group Changes in Body Composition Compared to the control group, reductions in all BC variables were seen in the ILI group from baseline to weeks 10--14 ( [Table 2](#) and [Figure 3](#) ). ## 3.3. Changes in Weight and Body Composition within the ILI Group Changes in BC within the ILI group at weeks 10--14, 6, and 12 months are shown in [Table 3](#) . After 6  and 12-month followup BW reduction was −23.8 ((95% CI: −25.9, −21.7) kg, *P* < 0.0001) and −20.3 ((95% CI: −23.3, −17.3) kg, *P* < 0.0001), respectively, compared with baseline. Within the ILI group, the mean (SD) percentage weight loss at 12 months was 15.6% (9.2%), and VFA and FM were reduced by 30.8% (21.1%) and 28.8% (17.4%) compared to baseline, respectively, ( [Figure 3](#) ). The proportions of subjects in the ILI group achieving ≥5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% reduction of their initial weight, respectively, are shown in [Table 4](#) . [Figure 4](#)shows the development in BMI of each subject in the ILI group. 52 (73.2%) of the subjects had BMI ≥ 40.0 kg/m ^2^ at week 0, and 51 (71.8%) had BMI < 40.0 kg/m ^2^ at 12-month followup. ## 3.4. Changes in Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors, Metabolic Syndrome, and Exercise Capacity within the ILI Group At baseline a total of 27 (38.0%), 8 (11.3%), and 6 (8.5%) in the ILI group were using blood pressure , lipid  and glucose lowering medication, respectively. Changes in CVD risk factors and exercise capacity within the ILI group are shown in Tables [5](#) and [6](#) . The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was reduced significantly ( *P* < 0.0001) within the ILI group across the 4 time points ( [Figure 5](#) ). ## 3.5. Eating Behavior before and after Intervention Group comparisons of scores on the TFEQ R21 showed no differences in eating behavior at baseline ( [Table 7](#) ). Eating behavior in the ILI group and controls prior to and after treatment is shown in [Figure 6](#) . Together these changes resulted in a significant reduction in UE and EE ( *P* = 0.033 and *P* < 0.0001) and increase in CR ( *P* < 0.0001) scores from week 0 to 12 months of followup within the ILI group, where the main changes occurred during the intervention period and remained quite stable thereafter. [Table 8](#)shows the univariate GLM analysis with respect to changes in weight and eating behaviour, respectively.:::\n",

      "## Aim The primary objective was to determine the rejection rate and reasons for blood sample rejection at 4 PHCFs before and after 1 phlebotomy training programme. ## Study setting 2 community health centres (CHCs) and 2 community day centres (CDCs) in Cape Town. ## Results The sample rejection rate was 0.79% (*n* = 60) at CHC A, 1.13% (*n* = 45) at CHC B, 1.64% (*n* = 38) at CDC C and 1.36% (*n* = 8) at CDC D pre training. The rejection rate remained approximately the same post training (*p* > 0.05). The average score increased from 63% (95% CI 6.97‒17.03) to 96% (95% CI 16.91‒20.09) at CHC A (*p =* 0.039), 58% (95% CI 9.09‒14.91) to 93% (95% CI 17.64‒18.76) at CHC B (*p* = 0.006), 60% (95% CI 8.84‒13.13) to 97% (95% CI 16.14‒19.29) at CDC C (*p =* 0.001) and 63% (95% CI 9.81‒13.33) to 97% (95% CI 18.08‒19.07) at CDC D (*p* = 0.001). ## Conclusion There is no statistically significant improvement in the rejection rate of blood samples (*p* > 0.05) post training despite knowledge improving in all HCPs (*p* < 0.05). # Results Approximately 6--10 HCPs participated at these different sites. There were 23 study participants ([Table 1](#)) who attended the phlebotomy training session across all the facilities. Most of the HCPs were aged between 30 and 50 years. There was only 1 male participant and 22 females. There were 3 student nurses, 17 nurses and only 3 doctors. The phlebotomy experience across participants varied, with 9 participants having less than 5 years' experience, 5 having 5--10 years' experience and 9 having more than 30 years' experience.table wrap\n",

The total number of blood samples included in the study during May 2014 (pre training): 7557 from CHC A, 3973 from CHC B, 2321 from CDC C and 589 from CDC D. The total number of blood samples included in the study during July 2014 (post training): 10 218 from CHC A, 4114 from CHC B, 2279 from CDC C and 630 from CDC D. During the month of May 2014 ([Table 2](#)): 60 of 7557 blood samples (0.79%) were rejected pre training at CHC A and 79 of 10 218 blood samples (0.77%) post training (*p* = 0.971). CHC A is the largest of the 4 facilities. Only 8 of 589 blood samples (1.36%) were rejected pre training at CDC D and 7 of 630 blood samples (1.11%) post training (*p* = 0.696). CDC D is the smallest of the 4 facilities.:::\n",

These include samples with missing reasons for rejection, samples older than 3 days, samples that leaked in transit as well as samples that were not received by the laboratory. [Table 3](#) shows a detailed summary of rejection rates and related reasons by facility. At CHC A, many samples were rejected because of clotting, 20 (0.26%) were rejected pre training and 16 (0.16%) post training ([Table 3](#)). Request form errors improved post training from 11 (0.15%) pre training to 8 (0.08%) post training. There was an increase in the rejection rate of samples because of unaccountable preanalytical errors, 17 (0.22%) pre training to 27 (0.26%) post training ([Figure 1](#)).:::\n",

      "## Methods Women with 1 singleton pregnancy of fewer than 20 weeks were randomly assigned to iodine (150 μg/d) or placebo from trial entry to birth. Childhood neurodevelopment was assessed at 18 months by using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley III). Iodine status and thyroid function were assessed at baseline and at 36 weeks' gestation. ## Results The trial was stopped after 59 women were randomly assigned following withdrawal of support by the funding body. The mean cognitive, language and motor scores on the Bayley III (iodine versus placebo, respectively) were 99.4 ± 12.2 versus 101.7 ± 8.2 (mean difference (MD) −2.3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) −7.8, 3.2; *P* = 0.42), 97.2 ± 12.2 versus 97.9 ± 11.5 (MD −0.7, 95 % CI −7.0, 5.6; *P* = 0.83) and 93.9 ± 10.8 versus 92.4 ± 9.7 (MD 1.4, 95 % CI −4.0, 6.9; *P* = 0.61), respectively. The registration number of this trial is [ACTRN12610000411044](#). The trial was registered on 21 May 2010. # Results Of the 645 women approached, 205 met the eligibility criteria. A total of 59 out of 205 (29 %) women were enrolled in the study from the Women's & Children's Hospital and the Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide, Australia, between June 2010 and October 2010 (Fig. [1](#)). 29 were randomly allocated to iodine and 30 to placebo (Fig. [1](#)). The baseline demographic characteristics of the participants are listed in Table [1](#). Women were informed of their treatment group allocation and were provided with a copy of the NHMRC recommendation for iodine supplementation in pregnancy [[9](#)]. All women except 2 (1 from each group) consented to continue with the follow up after unblinding. The mean gestational age at unblinding was 33 ± 7 weeks. The mean duration of intervention before unblinding was 16 weeks (range 2--23 weeks). 9 (31 %) women in the iodine group and 4 (13 %) in the placebo group gave birth before unblinding. 5 women in the iodine group and 18 in the placebo group stopped taking trial supplements. Only 1 woman in the placebo group commenced iodine supplements after unblinding.table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Despite being present in up to 1% of the population, few controlled trials have examined the efficacy of treatments for bipolar II depression. Pooled data are presented from 4 placebo controlled studies (BOLDER I [5077US1/0049] and II [D1447C00135]; EMBOLDEN I [D1447C00001] and II [D1447C00134]) that evaluated the efficacy of quetiapine monotherapy for depressive episodes in patients with bipolar II disorder. ## Methods All studies included an 8-week, double blind treatment phase in which patients were randomly assigned to treatment with quetiapine 300 mg/day, quetiapine 600 mg/day, or placebo. Outcome measures included the change from baseline in MADRS total score at week 8, effect sizes, and MADRS response and remission rates. ## Results and discussion Improvements in mean MADRS total scores from baseline to week 8 were significantly greater with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day (−15.58 [*n* = 283] and −14.88 [*n* = 289]; *p* < 0.001) compared with placebo (−11.61 [*n* = 204]). The MADRS effect sizes were 0.44 for quetiapine 300 mg/day and 0.47 for 600 mg/day (*p* < 0.001 vs placebo). Significantly higher proportions of patients receiving quetiapine, at both doses, than placebo treated patients achieved response and remission at week 8 (*p* < 0.01). # Results Patient disposition is shown in Figure [1](#). 1 total of 776 (35.2%) patients with bipolar II depression were included in the ITT population (283, 289, and 204 patients received quetiapine 300 mg/day, quetiapine 600 mg/day, or placebo, respectively). The safety population comprised 819 patients with bipolar II depression (298, 307, and 214 patients received quetiapine 300 mg/day, quetiapine 600 mg/day, or placebo, respectively), representing 35.4% of the total pooled safety population of patients with bipolar I or II depression from the 4 studies (*N* = 2,314). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Patient disposition.</strong></figcaption> </figure> At baseline, the demographic and clinical characteristics were similar among treatment groups (Table [1](#)).table wrap\n",

Significant separation from placebo was observed from week 1 for both doses of quetiapine and was maintained through week 8 (Figure [2](#)). Effect sizes, based on MADRS scores, were moderate for both quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day (MMRM: 0.44 and 0.47, respectively, *p* < 0.001 vs placebo; Figure [3](#)). The effect sizes in the bipolar I population in the 4 trials were 0.58 for quetiapine 300 mg/day and 0.64 for quetiapine 600 mg/day (Figure [3](#)). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Mean change from baseline to week 8 in MADRS total score (ITT population; LOCF).</strong></figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Effect sizes of quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day in patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.</strong></figcaption> </figure> Patients with bipolar II disorder stratified by a rapid  (≥4 mood episodes per year) or nonrapid cycling course also demonstrated significant improvements in MADRS total score at week 8. Among patients without a rapid cycling course, MADRS total score improved significantly by a mean (SE) of 15.18 (0.67) and 14.25 (0.66) with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day compared with 11.58 (0.75) points for placebo (*p* < 0.001 and *p* = 0.005 for quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day, respectively) at week 8. Significant symptomatic improvements at week 8 were also observed in patients with rapid cycling: 16.80 (1.63) and 16.92 (1.71) for quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day versus 11.12 (1.95) for placebo (*p* = 0.011 and *p* = 0.012, respectively). In the exploratory analysis of the relationship between MADRS total score at baseline and end of treatment, there was an indication that the difference between placebo and both quetiapine doses at end of treatment increased as baseline score increased (Table [2](#); Figure [4](#)).table wrap\n",

Among quetiapine treated patients, 64.7% (300 mg/day) and 62.6% (600 mg/day) were classified as responders at week 8 compared with 49.0% of placebo treated patients (*p* < 0.001 and *p* < 0.01 for 300 and 600 mg/day, respectively; ITT, LOCF). When compared with placebo (46.1%), significantly more quetiapine treated patients met remission criteria at week 8 (65.0% and 61.9%, respectively; *p* < 0.001 vs placebo; ITT, LOCF). At week 8, NNT for response and remission were 6 and 5 for quetiapine 300 mg/day and 7 and 6 for quetiapine 600 mg/day, respectively. ### Hamilton rating scale for depression total score Patients who were treated with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day demonstrated significantly greater improvements in HAM D total score from week 1 through week 8 compared with placebo (*p* < 0.001; ITT, LOCF). At week 8, HAM D total scores improved by a mean (SE) of 14.00 (0.49) and 13.57 (0.49) points for quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day, respectively, versus 10.88 (0.55) for placebo (*p* < 0.001). ### Hamilton rating scale for anxiety total score Following quetiapine treatment, patients demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety, as measured by mean change from baseline in HAM A total score at week 8 (*p* < 0.05 both doses vs placebo; Figure [6](#)). Significant improvements in HAM A total score with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day versus placebo were observed from week 1 onward (−9.62 [*p* < 0.001] and −8.89 [*p* < 0.05] vs −7.34 at week 8, respectively; ITT, LOCF). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Mean change from baseline to week 8 in HAM A total score (ITT population; LOCF).</strong></figcaption> </figure> ### Safety Overall rates of adverse events in the pooled safety population were 73.8%, 74.3%, and 67.8% for the quetiapine 300 mg/day, 600 mg/day, and placebo arms, respectively. As shown in Table [3](#), common adverse events associated with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day included dry mouth, somnolence, sedation, and dizziness. Adverse events potentially related to extrapyramidal symptoms were observed in 12.4%, 8.8%, and 6.1% of the quetiapine 300 mg/day, quetiapine 600 mg/day, and placebo groups, respectively. Rates of treatment emergent mania/hypomania during acute treatment were similar among the treatment groups: 1.3%, 3.3%, and 2.3% for quetiapine 300 mg/day, 600 mg/day, and placebo arms, respectively. Rates of discontinuation because of adverse events were 12.1% for quetiapine 300 mg/day, 17.9% for quetiapine 600 mg/day, and 5.1% for placebo. Changes from baseline in weight and laboratory parameters during acute treatment are presented in Table [4](#). Although average weight gain was only about 1 kg greater in the 2 groups receiving quetiapine, the proportions of patients in both arms gaining at least 7% body weight was higher in both quetiapine arms (Table [4](#)).table wrap\n",

      "The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of 850‐nm gallium arsenide aluminum (Ga‐As‐Al) laser therapy on pain, range of motion and disability in subacromial impingement syndrome. ## METHODS: 1 total of 52 patients (33 females and 19 males with a mean age of 53.59±11.34 years) with subacromial impingement syndrome were included. The patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Group I (n = 30, laser group) received laser therapy (5 joule/cm^2^ at each point over maximum 5‐6 painful points for 1 minute). Group II (n = 22, placebo laser group) received placebo laser therapy. Initially cold pack (10 minutes) was applied to all of the patients. The therapy program was applied 5 times a week for 14 sessions. ## RESULTS: In group I, statistically significant improvements in pain severity, range of motion except internal and external rotation and SPADI scores were observed compared to baseline scores after the therapy (p<0.05). In Group II, all parameters except range of motion of external rotation were improved (p<0.05). However, no significant differences were recorded between the groups (p>0.05). # RESULTS 52 patients (33 females, 19 males) with a mean age of 53.59±11.34 years with SAIS were included in the study. The sociodemographic and clinic characteristics of the patients were given in [Table 1](#). No statistically significant differences were detected between the groups in initial values (p>0.05). In group I, after the therapy statistically significant improvements in pain severity, ROM except internal and external rotation and SPADI scores were observed compared to baseline scores (p<0.05). In Group II, all parameters except ROM of external rotation were improved (p<0.05). However, no significant differences were recorded between the groups (p>0.05) ([Table 2](#)).:::\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Etoricoxib is 1 highly selective COX-2 inhibitor which was evaluated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ## Methods Double blind, randomized, placebo and active comparator controlled, 12-week study conducted at 67 sites in 28 countries. Patients received either placebo, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily, or naproxen 500 mg twice daily (2:2:1 allocation ratio). Key secondary measures included the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, patient global assessment of pain, and the percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response (a composite of pain, inflammation, function, and global assessments). ## Results 1171 patients were screened, 891 patients were randomized (N = 357 for placebo, N = 353 for etoricoxib, and N = 181 for naproxen), and 687 completed 12 weeks of treatment (N = 242 for placebo, N = 294 for etoricoxib, and N = 151 for naproxen). Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving etoricoxib and naproxen showed significant improvements in all efficacy endpoints (p<0.05). The percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response was 41% in the placebo group, 59% in the etoricoxib group, and 58% in the naproxen group. ## Conclusions In this study, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily was more effective than placebo and similar in efficacy to naproxen 500 mg twice daily for treating patients with RA over 12 weeks. Etoricoxib 90 mg was generally well tolerated in RA patients. # Results ## Patients Of the 1171 patients screened, 891 met eligibility criteria and were randomized. Baseline characteristics of the 891 patients in the 3 treatment groups were similar and are shown in Table [1](#). A total of 687 of the 891 patients (67.8% of the placebo group, 83.3% of the etoricoxib group, and 83.4% of the naproxen group) completed the 12-week study (Figure [1](#)). The mean number of days patients were on treatment was 65.5 for placebo, 76.0 for etoricoxib, and 76.5 for naproxen. The most common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy, and significantly more patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy in the placebo group than in the etoricoxib and naproxen group (25.2%, 12.5%, 10.5%, respectively, p<0.001 vs placebo). The results of all patients who had at least 1 post randomization efficacy measurement were included in the primary analysis of efficacy (93.0% in the placebo group, 97.5% in the etoricoxib group and 96.1% in the naproxen group).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Objectives: To compare the combination of paracetamol (20 mg/kg) and propofol to fentanyl (1 µg/kg) and propofol in terms of providing adequate analgesia and 1 comparable recovery profile in suction termination procedures. ## Methods: This is a prospective, randomized clinical study in which we obtained informed consents from 146 women (fentanyl group: 76 [52.1%], paracetamol group: 70 [47.9%]) who were scheduled for suction curettage at the Istanbul Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Education and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey in January 2015. ## Results: When the modified Aldrete scores at 60 minutes, systolic pressures at 0 minutes, oxygen saturation at 10, 15, 20 minutes, diastolic blood pressure at 10, 15, 20 minutes, heart rates, and visual analogue scores were compared, there was no significant difference between groups (p>0.05). In the fentanyl group, systolic blood pressures at 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes and diastolic blood pressure at 5 minutes and oxygen saturation at 5 minutes were significantly lower (p<0.05). # Results There were 146 patients involved in this study. When the demographic data, ASA and operation values of the 146 patients were compared (**[Figure 1](#)**), no significant differences were determined between groups (*p*>0.05) (**[Table 1](#)**). Also, no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of VAS and modified Aldrete scores after 60 minutes (*p*>0.05) (**[Table 2](#)**). There was no significant difference in the HR between groups (*p*>0.05) (**[Figure 2](#)**). In the fentanyl group, systolic blood pressures at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes were significantly lower (*p*<0.05) than in the paracetamol group; however, there was no difference between groups at 0 minutes (*p*>0.05) (**[Figure 3](#)**). Diastolic blood pressures at 5 minutes were significantly lower (*p*<0.05) in the fentanyl group; however, there were no differences between groups at 10, 15 and 20 minutes (*p*>0.05) (**[Figure 4](#)**). In the fentanyl group, SpO~2~ at 5 minutes was significantly lower (*p*<0.05) than in the paracetamol group, but there were no differences between groups at 10, 15, and 20 minutes (*p*>0.05) (**[Figure 5](#)**). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Flow diagram of 146 women who were scheduled for suction curettage.table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract # Abstract ## Background and aims: Recent studies have shown that etomidate is associated with fewer serious adverse events than propofol and has 1 noninferior sedative effect. Patients aged over 65 years who were scheduled to undergo screening colonoscopy were randomized to receive either etomidate or propofol based on midazolam. ## Results: The incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events was higher in the propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate group (54.8%) ( *P = *.040). VSF was detected in 17 (27.4%) and 31 (50.0%) patients in the etomidate and propofol groups, respectively ( *P = *.010). The incidence rate of adverse events disturbing the procedure was significantly higher in the etomidate group (25.8%) than in the propofol group (8.1%) (*P = *.008). Moreover, the incidence rate of myoclonus was significantly higher in the etomidate group (16.1%) than in the propofol group (1.6%) ( *P = *.004). There was no statistical significance between the 2 groups with respect to sedation times and sedation related outcomes including patients' and endoscopist's satisfaction. In the multivariate analysis, the etomidate group had significantly low odds ratio (OR) associated with VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval: 0.179--0.926, *P = *.032). # Results ## Demographic and baseline characteristics Initially, 130 patients aged over 65 years were assessed. Among them, 6 patients were excluded because of adrenocortical insufficiency (n = 1), desire to undergo endoscopy without sedation (n = 3), hypersensitivity to the drug (n = 1), or previous history of adverse events with sedation (n = 1) (Fig. [1](#)). Finally, a total of 124 patients aged over 65 years were enrolled, analyzed, and randomly assigned to 2 groups: propofol group (n = 62) and etomidate group (n = 62). The baseline characteristics including age, sex, procedure type, body mass index, smoking and alcohol history, outpatient status, anticoagulant use, ASA score, modified Mallampati score, and underlying diseases were not significantly different in the 2 groups (Table [1](#)). Additionally, there was no difference in interventional procedures such as polypectomy (*P* = .773), biopsy ( *P* = .930), and epinephrine injection ( *P = *.934). Sedation related outcomes such as induction time ( *P = *.833), total procedure time ( *P = *.111) and awake time (*P = *.070) were not different (Table [2](#)). ## Safety related outcomes The incidence rate of all cardiopulmonary adverse events was significantly higher in the propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate group (54.8%) ( *P = *.040) (Fig. [2](#)). The incidence rate of VSF was significantly higher in the propofol group (50.0%) than in the etomidate group (27.4%) ( *P = *.010). In addition, the incidence rate of transient hypotension was significantly higher in the propofol group (41.9%) than in the etomidate group (24.2%) (*P = *.036). In contrast, the incidence rate of adverse events disturbing the procedure was significantly higher in the etomidate group (25.8%) than in the propofol group (8.1%) (*P = *.008). The incidence rate of myoclonus was significantly higher in the etomidate group (16.1%) than in the propofol group (1.6%) (*P = *.004) (Table [3](#)). ∗Statistical significance between the 2 groups was tested by chi square analysis for the excellent group.</figcaption> </figure> When vital sign changes over time were diagrammed on a scatter plot up to 35 minutes, there was a significant difference in change in median SBP with passing time between the 2 groups (*P = *.020) (Fig. [3](#)A). Median HR significantly increased over time, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (Fig. [3](#)B). Median SpO2 was sustained above 98% on 2 L/min oxygen during the procedure. There was no significant difference over time between the 2 groups (Fig. [3](#)C). SBP = systolic blood pressure, HR = heart rate, SpO2 = peripheral oxygen saturation.</figcaption> </figure> Multivariate analysis of VSF with logistic regression showed that the etomidate group had significantly low odds ratio (OR) associated with VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval: 0.179--0.926, *P = *.032) (Table [4](#)). ## Efficacy related outcomes Outcomes related to the efficacy of sedation including patients' satisfaction, endoscopist's satisfaction, postprocedural abdominal pain, and postprocedural nausea or vomiting are shown in Table [2](#). There was no significant difference in patients' satisfaction (*P = *.130) and endoscopist's satisfaction (*P = *.743) between the 2 groups. In addition, differences in patients' postprocedural abdominal pain ( *P = *.763) and nausea or vomiting ( *P = *.075) between the 2 groups were not statistically significant. Moreover, the frequency of recall was not significantly different in both the groups (propofol group: 2/62 [3.2%], etomidate group: 5/62 [8.1%], *P = *.439).\n",
      "50 patients who undergone septoplasty were included in the study. 33 people who had similar age and distribution were enrolled as control group. Before and 1 and 3 months after surgery, anterior rhinomanometry, voice analysis by Multi Dimensional Voice Program, and spectrographic analysis were performed to patients. The recordings of /1/ vowel were used to evaluate average fundamental frequency (F0), jitter percent, and shimmer percent. In spectrographic analyses, F3- F4 values for the vowels /i, e, a, o, and u/, nasal formant frequencies of the consonants /m/ and /n/ in the word /mini/, and 4 formant frequencies (F1, F2, F3, and F4) for nasalized /i/ vowel following a nasal consonant /n/ in the word /mini/ were compared. Preoperative total nasal resistance (TNR) values of patients were higher than the control group (*P*=0.001). TNR values of patients measured 1 day before surgery and after surgery in the 1st and 3rd months were different and these differences were significant statistically (*P*=0.001). There was no significant difference between the voice analysis parameters in preoperative, postoperative 1st, and 3rd months. As a result of their subjective reviews, 12 patients (36%) noted their voices were better than before surgery and 20 patients (61%) noted no change before and after surgery. # RESULTS There were 29 men and 21 women in the study group. 7 patients who did not come to their postoperative controls, 3 patients who were observed septal perforation after septoplasty and could not be done ARM due to perforation, and 7 patients who had higher TNR value than avarage TNR value of control group were excluded. There were 9 patients applied radiofrequency ablation and all of them was in excluded group. Except absent patients, successful septoplasty rate was 77%. The study was conducted with 33 patients who have an increased nasal patency. 19 men (58%) and 14 women (42%) were enrolled as patient group and the mean age of patients was 25 years (range, 18 to 53 years). The mean age of control group was 27 years (range, 18 to 51 years) and there was no significant difference in terms of age and sex between patients and the control group (*P*<0.05) ([Table 1](#)). Preoperative mean TNR value of patients was higher than the control group's and this difference was significant statistically (*P*=0.001). Preoperative TNR values of patients decreased post operatively and these differences were again significant statistically (*P*=0.001) ([Table 2](#)). When asked patients whether changes in their voices after surgery, 20 patients (61%) noted no change, 12 patients (36%) said there was a change in a good way, and 1 (3%) noted a change in a bad way. Compared analysis results of /a/ vowel, there was no significant difference between the values before and 1 and 3 months after surgery ([Table 3](#)). Compared these results with the control group, there was no significant difference except NHR value (*P*=0.017). Compared analysis results of /n/ nasal consonant; there was no significant difference between the values before and 1 and 3 months after surgery. Compared these results with the control group, there were significant differences statistically about F3 formant freqency in postoperative 1st and 3rd months (*P*=0.022, *P*=0.024) and F4 formant frequency in postoperative 1st month (*P*=0.017) ([Table 4](#)). Compared analysis results of /mini/ word, there was no significant difference postoperative and with the control group ([Table 5](#)).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in infancy with 1 complex pathology. In adults, the clinical severity of AD has been associated with increases in T helper cell type (Th) 2, Th22, and Th17 serum markers, including high levels of CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 17 and CCL22 chemokines. ## Subjects and methods Serum samples ( *n* = 41) obtained from a randomized, double blind, and clinical dietary intervention study were used to study biomarkers in infants with AD. Baseline  and post intervention samples (4 months) were used, 6 chemokines and 9 ratios thereof were analyzed using Luminex and correlated to AD severity. In the initial study, the infants were randomized to receive extensively hydrolyzed whey based formula without (control) or with short chain galacto oligosaccharides/long chain fructo oligosaccharides (9:1) and *Bifidobacterium breve* M-16V (active). ## Results 31 Infants up to 11 months of age, with an objective SCORAD score (oSCORAD) ≥ 20 and elevated total IgE and/or specific IgE levels were included. In time, the median oSCORAD decreased in both groups by −8 (control, *p*  < 0.05; active, *p*  < 0.01). Irrespective of dietary intervention, several changes in Th2 chemokines (CCL17 and CCL22), inflammatory chemokine (CCL20), and the Th1 chemokine, CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 9, were detected over time. Overall CCL17 correlated to oSCORAD ( *r* = 0.446, *p*  < 0.01). After 4 months of dietary intervention, CXCL9 was higher ( *p*  < 0.01) in the active group compared with control [active, 2.33 (1.99--2.89); controls, 1.95 (1.77--2.43) log 10 median (range)]. In addition, a reduction in Th2/Th1 chemokine ratios for CCL17/CXCL9, CCL22/CXCL9, CCL20/CXCL10, and CCL20/CXCL11 was detected associated with the active intervention. # Results ## Infant Characteristics Overall, 53 infants with moderate to severe AD were screened. Of these, 31 infants had elevated IgE levels and were therefore considered eligible for randomization. In total, 26 infants completed the study (Figure [1](#) ). Baseline characteristics ( *n* = 31) are shown in Table [1](#) .table wrap\n",

The weight for age *z* -scores were also significantly lower ( *p*  < 0.05) in the control group than the active group with a mean (SD) of −0.5333 (0.7432) and 0.125 (0.8062), respectively. Atopic dermatitis severity was classified as moderate to severe with a median oSCORAD of 23 (Q1- Q3 = 21--27). All infants were born at term with a median gestational age of 39 weeks, and only 12.9% of the infants were born *via* cesarean section. The mean age of infants at the time of inclusion was 7 months (median 6, range 2--11 months). The male/female ratio was approximately 2:1 in both study groups. The majority (80%) of infants were of Caucasian descent. In addition, 83.9% of the infants were sensitized to at least 1 food allergen; 29% to at least 1 aero allergen, which was comparable in both groups. The topical corticosteroids were used in 93.5% of the infants for a mean (SD) of 124.6 (73.1) days before start of dietary intervention. Topical corticosteroid use was evenly distributed between the study groups, with a median (Q1- Q3) of 135 (67--150) days of topical steroid use in the control group and 113 (65--182) days in the active group, with no significant differences observed. Low potency topical corticosteroids (hydrocortisone acetate 1%) were most commonly used (83.9%) compared with moderate potency triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% (29%) and high potency mometasone furoate 0.1% (9.7%). The median [interquartile range (Q1- Q3)] for exclusive breastfeeding before study enrollment was 0 (0--3) months in the control group and 3 (0--6) months in the active group, but this was not significantly different. Cows' milk protein was introduced at a median (Q1- Q3) of 0 (0--3) months and 3 (0--6) months in the control and active groups, respectively, ( *p*  > 0.05). Complementary feeding was first introduced at a median (Q1- Q3) of 5 (4--6) months among all infants. ## Effect on Severity of AD At baseline, oSCORAD between the study groups was comparable, with a median (Q1- Q3) oSCORAD in the control group of 24 (21--27) and 21 (20--26) in the active group. After 4 months of dietary intervention, the average oSCORAD decreased in those infants ( *n* = 26) who completed the study. The median change in both groups of −8, resulted in a median (Q1- Q3) post intervention oSCORAD of 17 (12--21) in the control group and 13 (12--17) in the active group. Interestingly, only 4 out of 13 (31%) infants in the active group retained an oSCORAD above 15 (moderate AD) compared with 8 out of 13 (62%) infants in the control group. AD exacerbations occurred in 8 out of 26 infants (4 in both groups 30.8%) during dietary intervention period. The use of topical steroids during the dietary intervention period appears similar in both groups ( *p*  > 0.05) with a median (Q1- Q3) topical steroid use of 118.5 (113.5--120.8) days in the control group and 117.0 (113.0--121.5) days in the active group. ## Exploratory Immune Profiles in AD In total, 41 serum samples obtained from the clinical study were used for exploring the biomarker profiles of infants with moderate to severe AD and elevated IgE levels. For these infants from which serum samples were obtained, reduction of oSCORAD at baseline and after 4 months of dietary intervention is shown in (Figure [2](#) ). Additional parametric analysis using ordinary 1 way ANOVA was performed, to show robustness of the data. The analysis indicated no differences between the groups at baseline and confirmed the significant decline within control ( *p*  < 0.001) as well as within active ( *p*  < 0.0001) of oSCORAD, which support the non parametric analysis.

In addition, at baseline ( *n* = 18), a significant correlation was detected between levels of IgE and chemokines CCL17 (Spearman *r* = 0.721, *p*  < 0.01) and CCL22 (Spearman *r* = 0.549, *p*  < 0.05). Moreover, a significant correlation between galectin-9 and chemokines CCL20 (Spearman *r* = 0.585, *p*  < 0.05) and CCL22 (Spearman *r* = 0.492, *p*  < 0.05) was observed.table wrap\n",

Both levels, however, did not significantly change in either group (Figures [3](#) A,B). The levels of Th2 driving chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 significantly changed over time (Figures [3](#) C,D). In the control group, a significant reduction of CCL22, but not CCL17, was detected (W test, *p*  < 0.05), whereas in the active group, both CCL17 and CCL22 were significantly reduced (W test, *p*  < 0.05, for both). CCL20, a strong chemokine for DCs, remained unchanged in the control group, yet was significantly reduced in the active group after 4 months of dietary intervention (W test, *p*  < 0.05) (Figure [3](#) E). While no differences were observed in the release of Th1-driving chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in the control group, after 4 months of dietary intervention, CXCL9 levels were significantly higher in the active group as compared with the control group (MWU, *p*  < 0.01). The dietary intervention resulted in a higher CXCL9 level (log 10 median, 2.33; range 1.99--2.89) in the active group as compared with the control group (1.95; 1.77--2.43) (Figures [3](#) F -H). Moreover, additional parametric analysis using ordinary 1 way ANOVA confirm our statistical findings within the serum biomarker analysis, although small sample size may not reveal possible skewness of the data and therefore the parametric analysis are not shown. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Allergy markers measured in serum of the control (open dots, <em>n</em> = 20) and active (closed triangles, <em>n</em> = 21) groups before and after dietary intervention.

      "## Settings and Design: This was 1 prospective, randomized, controlled, double blinded trial performed in a tertiary care hospital. ## Materials and Methods: 42 patients undergoing SILC were randomized to receive either ultrasound guided (USG) bilateral mid axillary TAP blocks with 0.375% ropivacaine or local anesthetic infiltration of the port site. The primary outcome measure was the requirement of morphine in the 1st 24 h postoperatively. ## Results: The 24 h morphine requirement (mean ± standard deviation) was 34.57 ± 14.64 mg in TAP group and 32.76 ± 14.34 mg in local infiltration group (*P* = 0.688). The number of patients requiring intraoperative supplemental fentanyl in TAP group was 8 and in local infiltration group was 16 (*P* = 0.028).

      "# Abstract ## Objective The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of an ultra low dose vaginal estriol 0.03 mg in combination with viable *Lactobacillus acidophilus* KS400 (Gynoflor^®^ vaginal tablets) in the short term therapy and to investigate the long term maintenance dose in the treatment of vaginal atrophy. ## Methods This was 1 double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study (Controlled phase * -* initial therapy) followed by an open label follow up (Open phase -  test medication initial and maintenance therapy). Included were postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy symptoms and Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) of ≤ 40%. The method of treatment was initial therapy with test medication (or placebo in 1st phase), 1 vaginal tablet daily for 12 days, followed by maintenance therapy, 1 tablet on 2 consecutive days weekly for 12 weeks. ## Results A total of 87 women completed the study. The Controlled phase results for a change in VMI demonstrated superiority of the 0.03 mg estriol -lactobacilli combination to placebo (*p* < 0.001). In the test group, the positive change in VMI was 35.2%, compared to 9.9% in the placebo group. In the Open phase after the initial therapy, the VMI was increased to 55.4% and, during maintenance therapy, it stayed at a comparable level (52.8--49.4%). ## Conclusions The ultra low dose, vaginal 0.03 mg estriol -lactobacilli combination (Gynoflor^®^) was superior to placebo with respect to changes in VMI after the 12-day initial therapy, and the maintenance therapy of 2 tablets weekly was sufficient to prevent the relapse of vaginal atrophy. # Results An overview of subject disposition is given in [Figure 2](#). A total of 87 women completed both phases of the study as scheduled. 1 woman in the placebo group withdrew her consent before visit C1 and was excluded from the ITT population due to no data. Another woman in the placebo group was excluded from the PPS population due to prior termination of the study after visit C1.

      "SD, standard deviation At C1, after1/2 of the treatment period, the increase in VMI was 19.8% for the estriol -lactobacilli combination and 11.8% for the placebo. This difference was not significant (*p* = 0.061), indicating that a 6-day therapy with the 0.03 mg estriol -lactobacilli combination is not sufficient for full improvement. The development of VMI itself during the Controlled phase is shown in [Figure 3](#). E, entry visit; C1, follow up 5–7 days after start of therapy; C2, follow up 2–4 days after end of initial therapy</figcaption> </figure> The predominant vaginal symptoms ([Figure 4](#)) at the Entry visit were vaginal dryness and dyspareunia in both groups. The percentage of women with moderate or severe dryness decreased more in the estriol -lactobacilli combination group, resulting in a significant difference between the groups, both at C1 (*p* = 0.023) and at C2 (*p* < 0.001). The number of women who reported having intercourse was too low for a valid statistical analysis of dyspareunia (E: approximately 45%, C1 and C2: 11--21%). The percentage with moderate or severe dyspareunia at E was 84% in the estriol -lactobacilli combination group and 90% in the placebo group. The corresponding numbers at C1 were 40% for both groups, and at C2 -0% in the estriol -lactobacilli combination group and 22% in the placebo group. E, entry visit; C1, examination 5–7 days after start of therapy; C2, examination 2–4 days after end of initial, daily therapy</figcaption> </figure> Development of other secondary variables is shown in [Table 3](#). The total symptom score improved during estriol -lactobacilli combination therapy compared to placebo: at C1 without significant difference, and at C2 with significant difference. The percentages of the increase of superficial cells and the decrease of parabasal cells showed a similar dynamic: at C1 there were no significant differences between the groups; however, at C2 significant improvements in favor of the estriol -lactobacilli combination were observed. The number of lactobacilli and LBG also improved in both groups at C1, with no significant difference between the groups. But again, the corresponding results at C2 were significantly better in the test medication group. The mean vaginal pH decreased significantly more in the estriol -lactobacilli combination group as compared to placebo both at C1 and at C2. The global efficacy of the estriol -lactobacilli combination by investigator was significantly better than that of placebo, both at C1 and at C2. The rating by the patient was not significantly different at C1, but at C2 was significantly better for the test group.Data\n",

After the daily initial therapy with the estriol -lactobacilli combination, VMI was clearly increased ([Figure 5](#)). During the weekly maintenance therapy, the mean VMI stayed at a comparable level at Follow up visits 2 and 3, showing moderate estrogenic stimulation. Thus, the 0.03 mg estriol -lactobacilli combination at a regimen of 2 vaginal tablets per week was on average sufficient to maintain the improved VMI after the initial 12-day therapy.

All other secondary variables are shown in [Table 4](#). The percentage of epithelial cells clearly improved during initial therapy and remained at similar levels at Follow up visits 2 and 3. The percentage of women with more than 50 lactobacilli per field of view clearly increased not only during initial therapy, but also during maintenance therapy, reaching the highest level at the end of the study. A similar development was observed for LBG: the percentage of women with a normal flora (LBG I) increased also during the maintenance therapy, resulting in 67% of all women having a normal flora and only 6% having an abnormal flora at the end of the study.

      "The purpose was to evaluate whether using 1 depression self rating scale in recurrent person centred GP consultations affected depression severity, quality of life, medication use, and sick leave frequency. ## Methods Patients in the intervention group met their GP regularly at least 4 times during the 3 months intervention. Depression severity was measured with Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II), quality of life with EQ-5D, and psychological well being with the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). All variables were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. ## Results There were no significant differences between the intervention and control group in depression severity reduction or remission rate, change in quality of life, psychological well being, sedative prescriptions, or sick leave during the whole 12-month follow up. However, significantly more patients in the intervention group continued antidepressants until the 6 month follow up (86/125 vs 78/133, *p* < 0.05). However, reduction of depressive symptoms, remission rate, quality of life, psychological well being, sedative use, sick leave, and health care use 4-12 months was not significantly different from the TAU group. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: [NCT01402206](#).

      "The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 1 3 month application of a canola phenolic acid based cream (CPA) on AK lesions. ## Patients and methods This was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 12 week clinical study conducted at a single center in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. 45 subjects (30 CPA and 15 placebo), aged 45--85 years with 3--10 AKs within a 20 cm^2^ treatment area (scalp, forehead, dorsal forearm, neck, or back of hand) were enrolled. ## Results Although complete AK lesion clearance was not seen in this study, a significant reduction in the mean change from baseline in the average lesion area was observed at weeks 3 ( *P*=0.002), 6 (*P*<0.001), and 12 (*P*<0.001) in the CPA group, but only at weeks 6 and 12 in the placebo group (*P*=0.005 and *P*=0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the proportion of participants with a $10% decrease in average lesion area was significantly higher in the CPA group than the placebo group at weeks 3 (*P*=0.05) and 6 (*P*=0.02), and showed a trend at week 12 (*P*=0.06). A subset analysis of the change in average lesion area based upon the total lesion area at baseline revealed that CPA elicited a greater reduction than placebo (2×) in participants with a baseline total AK lesion area of 100--500 mm^2^ than in participants with a total area <100 mm^2^ (1.3×). # Results ## Participant disposition 45 eligible subjects (4 male and 41 female) were randomized and 42 completed the study ([Figure 1](#)). 3 of the 45 participants did not complete the entire treatment period because of loss to follow up (N=1) or AEs (N=2) ([Figure 1](#)). All enrolled participants were white Hispanic except for 1 participant of Asian ethnicity. Participants ranged from 45 to 82 years of age and the mean age of those on CPA was 60.0±10.8 years and those on placebo 55.7±9.1 years ([Table 1](#)). All study participants had mild AK lesions and 2 participants in the CPA group had 2 moderate lesions along with mild lesions. There was no difference in body mass index, average AK lesion area or total lesion area between the treatment groups at baseline ([Table 1](#)). ## Efficacy of CPA Although none of the study participants achieved complete clearance, decreases in average lesion area were seen with both CPA and placebo treatment ([Figure 2](#)). The CPA group showed almost twice the decrease in lesion size as the placebo group ([Figure 3](#)). The reduction was significant for both CPA and placebo groups at 6 (*P*<0.001 and *P*=0.005, respectively) and 12 weeks (*P*<0.001 and *P*=0.002, respectively), but only significant in the CPA group at 3 weeks (*P*=0.002). The difference in the week 6 change between the CPA and placebo groups approached statistical significance ( *P*=0.09). There was a decrease in average lesion area from week 12 to week 36 (post treatment) in the CPA group (week 36 assessment was not performed in the placebo group), indicating that the improvement in the CPA group persisted beyond the treatment period ([Figures 2](#) and [3](#)). In the 2 participants with moderate lesions in the CPA group, lesions decreased to mild in severity at week 6, week 12, and follow up at week 36. A greater proportion of participants in the CPA group than the placebo group showed a >10% decrease in average lesion size at week 3 (*P*=0.05) and week 6 (*P*=0.02) and showed a trend toward significance at week 12 ( *P*=0.06) ([Figure 4](#)). No difference was seen between the groups in the proportion of participants with>25% reduction in the average lesion size, but >50% reductions were observed only in the CPA group ([Figure 4](#)). Subset analyses based upon the baseline total lesion area (<100 mm^2^, 100--249 mm^2^ and 250--499 mm^2^) showed differences in treatment response within certain total lesion size groups. Participants in the CPA group with a total lesion area <100 mm^2^ demonstrated a 1.3× greater mean reduction in average lesion size than placebo (data not shown). Similarly, greater responses were observed for participants in the CPA group compared to placebo for total lesion areas 101--250 mm^2^ (1.9× reduction) and 251--500 mm ^2^ (2.0× reduction). The CPA group showed a trend toward higher prevalence of lesion scabbing, a sign of healing, after 12 weeks of treatment (6.8%) than those treated with placebo (1.3%, *P*=0.09). Average lesion area was examined for participants with lesion onset of ≤5 years, 5--10 years, ≤10 years, and >10 years. Greater reductions in lesion size were seen in the CPA group than the placebo group for all subsets and was found to be more pronounced in participants with lesion onset ≤10 years compared to those with onset >10 years (data not shown). ## Safety analysis 1 serious adverse event, a parasitic amoeba infection was reported during this study in a participant receiving placebo. A total of 56 AEs (45 CPA, 11 placebo) were reported in 30 (20 CPA, 10 placebo) out of the 45 participants in the safety population (30 CPA, 15 placebo). There were 10 events (9 CPA, 1 placebo) among 4 participants (3 CPA, 1 placebo) that were judged by the principal investigator to be probably or possibly related to the study product. Of these, 5 were skin related, and the other 5 were eye, gastrointestinal, general, immune, and vascular disorders. The skin related disorders occurred in 3 participants, 2 in the CPA group, and 1 in the placebo group. Blood pressure was significantly reduced compared to baseline by a mean of 7.8 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (*P*=0.01) and a mean of 4.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (*P*<0.001) after 6 weeks of treatment with CPA. Sodium and red blood cell count were both significantly decreased in the CPA group as compared to the placebo group (*P*=0.02 and *P*=0.03, respectively).\n",
      "# Abstract ## Introduction In 1 previous pooled analysis of 19 double blind clinical studies conducted by Merck, which included data available as of July 2009 on 10,246 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), treatment with sitagliptin was shown to be generally well tolerated compared with treatment with control agents. The present analysis updates the safety and tolerability assessment of sitagliptin by examining pooled data from 25 double blind clinical studies. ## Methods The present analysis included data from 14,611 patients in 25 studies with T2DM who received either sitagliptin 100 mg/day (*n* = 7,726; sitagliptin group) or a comparator agent (*n* = 6,885; non exposed group). These studies represent all randomized, double blind trials conducted by Merck that included patients treated with the usual clinical dose of sitagliptin (100 mg/day) for between 12 weeks and 2 years, and for which results were available as of December 2011. Incidence rates of specific AEs were generally similar between the 2 groups, except for higher incidence rates of hypoglycemia related to the greater use of a sulfonylurea and diarrhea related to the greater use of metformin in the non exposed group, and of constipation in the sitagliptin group. ## Conclusion In this updated pooled safety analysis of data from 14,611 patients with T2DM, sitagliptin 100 mg/day was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 2 years in duration. # Results ## Patient Characteristics and Exposure In the entire 25-study cohort, patients (55% male) had an mean age of 54 years (range 19--91 years; 17% ≥65 years), a mean duration of diabetes of 5.1 years, and a mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 8.4% at baseline (with 29% of patients having a baseline HbA1c ≥9.0%) (Table [1](#)). The majority of patients were White (61%), with 18% Asian and 6% Black. At baseline, 10% of patients had a history of cardiovascular disease, and 81% had additional cardiovascular risk factors besides type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, including hypertension (53%), history of dyslipidemia/hypercholesterolemia (49%), and history of smoking (39%).table wrap\n",

      "0The predefined analysis for hypoglycemia (i.e., excluding data after initiation of glycemic rescue therapy) showed a between group difference of −6.2 events per 100 patient years (95% CI −7.6, −5.0), favoring the sitagliptin group. The difference observed for hypoglycemia was mainly due to the use of a sulfonylurea as a comparator agent in 3 studies of up to 2 years in duration, as well as a study in which patients were switched from placebo to a sulfonylurea during a double blind continuation period (P020 in Table [6](#) in Appendix). In a separate pooled analysis of hypoglycemia in which confounding effects of a sulfonylurea or insulin as either background or comparator therapies were removed, the incidence rates of hypoglycemia were 5.6 and 5.1 per 100 patient years in the sitagliptin (*n* = 5,956) and non exposed (*n* = 5,122) groups, respectively, with a between group difference of 0.5 events per 100 patient years (95% CI −0.7, 1.6). ### GI Symptoms The primary analysis of select GI adverse events demonstrated similar incidence rates for the pooled select GI terms, the composite of abdominal pain terms, nausea, and vomiting (Table [4](#)). The incidence rate of the adverse event of constipation was higher in the sitagliptin group (2.3) than in the non exposed group (1.8). The differences observed for diarrhea mainly reflected the use of metformin as a comparator; when the confounding effects of initiation of metformin were removed, the incidence rates were 4.3 and 4.9 per 100 patient years in the sitagliptin (*n* = 5,940) and non exposed (*n* = 5,122) groups, respectively.table wrap\n",

      "greater and slightly less than 0, respectively ### MACE Detailed description of the analyses of MACE has been previously published [[12](#)]. The exposure adjusted incidence of MACE was 0.65 per 100 patient years in the sitagliptin group, and 0.74 per 100 patient years in the non exposed group, with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.83 (95% CI 0.53, 1.30). ### Neoplasms As noted above, the analysis of all events of malignancies revealed similar incidences in the 2 treatment groups: 0.90 per 100 patient years in the sitagliptin group and 0.93 per 100 patient years in the non exposed group [between group difference of −0.05 (95% CI −0.41, 0.30)]. Low incidence rates of a wide range of specific malignancies were reported, with similar rates in both treatment groups; the 95% CI did not exclude 0 for any of the specific malignancies that were reported. The most common malignancies observed were basal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer (Table [8](#) in Appendix). The exposure adjusted incidence rates for the pooled terms related to the category of pancreatic cancer were similar in the 2 treatment groups (0.05 and 0.06 events per 100 patient years in the sitagliptin and non exposed groups, respectively). The number of adverse events (3 in each group) was below the pre defined threshold for calculating a 95% CI. The incidence rate of adverse events in the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC overall was 2.03 per 100 patient years in the sitagliptin group and 1.52 per 100 patient years in the non exposed group [between group difference of 0.52 (95% CI 0.03, 1.01)]. The higher rate in the sitagliptin group was related to a higher rate of non malignant neoplasms in the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC [incidence rates of 1.18 and 0.60 per 100 patient years in the sitagliptin and non exposed groups, respectively; between group difference of 0.60 (95% CI 0.25, 0.96)]. The only term for which the 95% CI around the between group difference excluded 0 was lipoma [between group difference 0.15 (95% CI 0.02, 0.29)]. A sensitivity analysis, performed to assess the incidence of non malignant neoplasms across any SOC, revealed a similar pattern, with incidences of 1.58 and 1.12 per 100 patient years in the sitagliptin and non exposed groups, respectively [between group difference of 0.45 (95% CI 0.02, 0.89)]; in this sensitivity analysis, the adverse event term \"colonic polyp\" was the most common, with similar incidences in the 2 treatment groups (0.25 and 0.26 per 100-patient years, respectively). ### Angioedema At baseline, 29.4% and 28.1% of sitagliptin treated and non exposed patients, respectively, were treated with ACE inhibitors. In the subgroup defined by ACE inhibitor use, the exposure adjusted incidence of events was 0.99 per 100-patient years in the sitagliptin group and 1.35 per 100-patient years in the non exposed group; for those patients not treated with ACE inhibitors, the incidence rates were 1.14 and 1.16, respectively. For the composite endpoint of pancreatitis (which included the MedDRA terms \"pancreatitis\" and \"pancreatitis acute\"), the incidence rates were similar for both groups (Table [4](#)), with a difference in rate of −0.0 (95% CI −0.2, 0.1). The incidence of acute renal failure was assessed using both the narrow SMQ and the broad SMQ (Table [4](#)); low and similar rates were observed in both treatment groups for both composite endpoints, as well as for the composite endpoint of proteinuria, which comprised the MedDRA terms \"albumin urine present\" or \"protein urine present\". Separate analyses were done on the composite endpoints of bronchitis, pneumonia, and upper respiratory infection (Table [4](#)). Similar incidences were seen in both treatment groups for all 3 of these infection composites. The incidence of the composite endpoint of rash was higher in the sitagliptin group compared with the non exposed group (Table [4](#)). The incidence of the individual adverse event term \"atrial fibrillation\" was higher in the sitagliptin group (Table [4](#)). For the predefined composite endpoint of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, the between group difference was 0.2 event per 100 patient years, and the 95% CI did not exclude 0 (95% CI −0.0, 0.4). ## Specific Adverse Events for which CI Excluded 0 The incidences of adverse events for which the 95% CI excluded 0 are depicted in Table [5](#). There were 17 specific adverse events in which the incidence was higher in the sitagliptin group, and 23 specific adverse events in which the incidence was higher in the non exposed group. For those adverse events in which the between group difference was ≥0.5 events per 100 patient years, there were 2 (constipation and dyspepsia) and 7 (diarrhea, fatigue, edema peripheral, blood glucose decreased, hypoglycemia, blood glucose increased, and weight increased) in which the incidences were higher in the sitagliptin and non exposed groups, respectively. Apart from the adverse event of hypoglycemia, the between group differences in adverse events for which the 95% CI excluded 0 were all less than 1.5 events per 100 patient years.table wrap\n",

The proportions of patients who met the predefined criterion of 2 or more consecutive serum creatinine measurements with an increase from baseline of ≥0.3 mg/dL, or an increase from baseline of ≥50% were also similar in the 2 groups (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively).\n",
      "40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine (910 mg/m^2^ at day 1--3) given as 1 short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide. HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin (500 mg/m^2/^d over 18 h), ifosfamide (4 g/m^2^/d over 4 h) and etoposide (500 mg/m^2^/d) all given for 3 consecutive days. All patients received prophylactic application of G CSF (5 μg kg^−1^ subcutaneously) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment. The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10% from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min^−1^) and 37% in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min^−1^) (*P*< 0.01). Stomatitis grade III/IV occurred in 25% without versus 0% of patients with amifostine (*P* = 0.01). Acute nausea/vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT~3~ receptor antagonists/dexamethasone/trifluorpromazine. Engraftment of neutrophil (> 500 μl^−1^) and thrombocytes (> 25 000 μl^−1^)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12, respectively, both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm. The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30% savings in costs for supportive care (Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient). Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine, calculation of in patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [http://www.bjcancer.com](#)\n",
      "# Abstract ## Aims This post hoc assessment evaluated the efficacy and safety of once‐daily, prandial glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist lixisenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90  mL /min), or mild (60‐89  mL /min) or moderate (30‐59  mL /min) renal impairment. ## Methods Patients from 9 lixisenatide trials in the GetGoal clinical trial programme were categorized by baseline creatinine clearance: normal renal function (lixisenatide n = 2094, placebo n = 1150); renal impairment (mild: lixisenatide n = 637, placebo n = 414; moderate: lixisenatide n = 122, placebo n = 68). ## Results HbA1c, 2‐hour postprandial plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose were comparably reduced in lixisenatide‐treated patients with normal renal function, and mild and moderate renal impairment. 1 14% higher incidence of GI AEs and a 10% higher incidence of nausea and vomiting were seen with mild impairment vs normal function ( P= .003 for both), but no significant differences were observed between the mild and moderate impairment categories ( P= .99 and P= .57, respectively), or between the moderate impairment and normal categories ( P= .16 and P= .65, respectively). ## Conclusions This study demonstrates that baseline renal status does not affect efficacy outcomes in lixisenatide‐ vs placebo‐treated patients, and that no lixisenatide dose adjustment is required for patients with T2D with mild or moderate renal impairment. # RESULTS ## Patient demographics and clinical characteristics at baseline The distribution of patients in the combined safety population by renal function category and a summary of patient characteristics at baseline is given in Table [2](#) .table wrap\n",

The combined safety population from the 9 GetGoal trials included in this analysis comprised 2869 patients who received lixisenatide and 1639 patients who received placebo; the mITT population comprised 2720 patients and 1577 patients who received lixisenatide and placebo, respectively. Within the safety population, 3244 patients were classified as having normal renal function, 1051 patients had a mild renal impairment and 190 patients a moderate renal impairment.

Total percentage correct quiz scores were created reflecting participants' ability to select the healthier of 2 foods and estimate amounts of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium in foods. Quiz scores and product perceptions were compared with 1-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey tests. ## Results The MTL+caloric intake group (mean [standard deviation], 73.3% [6.9%]) and Choices group (72.5% [13.2%]) significantly outperformed the no label group (67.8% [10.3%]) and the TL+SNL group (65.8% [7.3%]) in selecting the more healthful product on the healthier product quiz. The MTL and MTL+caloric intake groups achieved average scores of more than 90% on the saturated fat, sugar, and sodium quizzes, which were significantly better than the no label and Choices group average scores, which were between 34% and 47%. # Results ## Study outcomes ### Healthier product quiz Participant scores for the healthier product quiz varied significantly among groups ([Table 2](#)).

      "## Methods 1 quasi experimental study with an intervention group and a control group was conducted between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2010 in 2 intensive care units (ICUs) of a university hospital that participated in a national HAI surveillance network. Surveillance was interrupted during the year 2007 in unit A (intervention group) and was continuous in unit B (control group). Period 1 (pre test period) comprised patients hospitalized during 2004 to 2006, and period 2 (post test period) involved patients hospitalized during 2008 to 2010. Patients hospitalized ≥48 hours and intubated during their stay were included. ## Results A total of 2,771 patients, accounting for 19,848 intubation days at risk, were studied; 307 had VAP. The VAP attack rate increased in unit A from 7.8% during period 1 to 17.1% during period 2 (*P* <0.001); in unit B, it was 7.2% and 11.2% for the 2 periods respectively (*P* = 0.17). Adjusted VAP incidence rose in unit A after surveillance disruption (incidence rate ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.47, *P* = 0.036), independently of VAP trend; no change was observed in unit B. All cause mortality and length of stay increased (*P* = 0.028 and *P* = 0.038, respectively) in unit A between periods 1 and 2. In unit B, no change in mortality was observed (*P* = 0.22), while length of stay decreased between periods 1 and 2 (*P* = 0.002). # Results ## Study participants Of the 4,411 patients included in the surveillance of both units during the study period, 2,915 (61.1%) were exposed to mechanical ventilation during their hospital stay. Data were missing for 4.9% (n = 144) of intubated patients and were, therefore, excluded. Totally, 2,771 patients, accounting for 37,330 hospitalisation days, 26,768 intubation days and 19,848 intubation days at risk, were analysed. Among them, 940 (34%) were hospitalised in unit A, and 1,831 (66%) in unit B. Overall, 62% (n = 1,724) were men, and mean ± SD age was 60 ± 16 years. Totally, 61% (n = 1,694) received antibiotics at admission, 41% (n = 1,142) came from home, and 26% (n = 721) were immunosuppressed. Mean ± SD SAPSII score was 53 ± 20. All cause in hospital mortality was 26% (n = 712). Overall, 307 patients had VAP. The VAP attack rate was 11.1 per 100 intubated patients and the VAP incidence rate was 15.5 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 13.8 to 17.3) per 1,000 intubation days at risk. ## Characteristics by group and period Table [1](#) reports the characteristics of hospitalised patients by group and period. In the intervention group with surveillance interrupted in 2007, patients hospitalised during period 2 compared to period 1 more often came from home (*P* = 0.004), were more immunosuppressed (*P* <0.001), more often had surgery as diagnosis category (*P* <0.001), received antibiotics less frequently at admission (*P* <.001), were older (*P* = 0.022), and presented lower mean SAPSII (*P* <0.001). In the control group with continuous surveillance, patients hospitalised during period 2 compared to period 1 were less likely to come from home (*P* <0.001), were more immunosuppressed (*P* <0.001), and received antibiotics more frequently at admission (*P* <0.001).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background During laparoscopy, insufflation of an inert gas in the peritoneal cavity creates 1 working space to facilitate surgery. The space should be large enough to facilitate surgery without increasing intra abdominal pressure (IAP) over a threshold limit (usually 15 mm Hg). ## Materials and Methods 20 female mixed breed dogs (20 ± 3 kg, 18 ± 1.2 months) were selected. They were randomly divided to 2 groups (n = 10). The intra abdominal pressure was maintained 12 mm Hg and 20 mm Hg during the operation in control group and in test group respectively. ## Conclusions Our findings revealed that organs that their blood supplies are related to 1 single or 2 arteries and their blood drainage are related to 1 or 2 veins are more sensitive to increased intra abdominal pressure. # 4. In heart rate evaluation at equal intervals, no significant differences were observed over time between the 2 groups. Also in respiratory rate, there were no significant differences (P>0.05). Results of end tidal CO ~2~ measurements did not show severe hypoventilation during anesthesia in both groups. Comparison of this data between groups did not show any significant difference (P > 0.05). The mean of hemoglobin saturation measurements in the 2 groups did not show any significant difference (P > 0.05). Histopathologic evaluations revealed pathological changes at the kidney of all the dogs in test group (intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg) ( [Figure 1](#) ) in comparison to control group (intra abdominal pressure: 12 mm Hg) ( [Figure 2](#) ). The differences between 2 groups were not significant. Any pathologic change at the spleen was not detected in 2 groups. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Pancreas Acinar Necrosis<br /> (a) normal acinar histological section of pancreas (control group), (b) acinar necrosis histopathological section of pancreas (test group; intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg).</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Kidney Histopathological Changes<br /> (a) Normal renal cortex histological section (control group), (b) necrosis of renal cortex (test group; intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg), (c) normal medullary tubules (test group; intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg), (d) more sever necrosis of renal cortex (test group; intraabdominal pressure: 20 mm Hg).</figcaption> </figure>\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background To investigate whether cumulus cell removal after 1 3 h co incubation of gametes can affect the outcomes of in vitro fertilization. ## Methods A prospective randomized sibling oocyte study was performed in which sibling oocytes obtained from each patient were randomly assigned to either a 3 h or 20 h group (cumulus cells removed at 3 h or 20 h after insemination, respectively). Same origin embryos (either 3 h or 20 h) were transferred. The study participants were patients < 38 years old and with infertility due to tubal factors. ## Results The study enrolled 172 patients, from whom 2275 oocytes were retrieved (1139 oocytes for the 3 h group and 1136 oocytes for the 20 h group). A total of 134 patients received embryo transfers (74 patients in the 3 h group and 60 patients in the 20 h group), and there were 54 live births (32 in the 3 h group and 22 in the 20 h group). When compared with patients in the 20 h group, patients in the 3 h group produced a larger number of optimal quality embryos, but had higher rates of polyspermy and low birth weight newborns. The 2 groups showed no differences in their rates of normal fertilization, pregnancy, and live birth. ## Trial registration Current controlled trial [ChiCTR OOC-15006878](#) # Results The study recruited 172 patients; among whom, 134 patients were analyzed (Fig. [1](#), 74 patients in the 3 h group and 60 patients in the 20 h group). The mean age of the patients was 29.7 years (30.3 ± 3.7 years in the 3 h group and 29.3 ± 2.7 years in the 20 h group). The numbers of treatment cycles in the 3 h and 20 h groups were 1.0 ± 0.2 and 1.1 ± 0.4, respectively. 30 patients were excluded due to either cancelled cycles (3 patients) or mixed embryo transfers (27 patients). 8 patients were not included in the statistical analysis because they received early rescue ICSI. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>CONSORT flow diagram</figcaption> </figure> The fertilization, embryo, and pregnancy outcomes are shown in Tables [1](#), [2](#), and [3](#). When compared with the 20 h group, the 3 h group had a significantly higher polyspermy rate and percentage of optimal embryos.

      "# Abstract # Results ## Sample demographics Participants (n = 190) were recruited from 40 states and all were licensed or certified to conduct substance abuse treatment. Certified drug and alcohol providers comprised 33% of the sample, 31% were social workers, and were 18% Licensed Professional Counselors, with the remaining 18% in various other disciplines such as psychologists, physicians and nurses. Participants reported that they spent, on average, 25.62 (SD = 11.16) h per week treating clients with substance use disorders. Women comprised 62% of the sample. Participants were 79.7% White, 5.9% Black or African American, 2.6% American Indian/Alaska Native, 0.7% Asian or Asian American, 5.9% Hispanic, 5.2% other backgrounds (See [Table 2](#) ). The 2 groups were examined for differences in relevant baseline measures. At baseline, there were no differences between groups on measures of clinician speech (e.g., MICO, reflection:question ratio, percent complex reflections; all p > 0.38) or client speech (change talk, sustain talk, percent CT; all p > 0.42). ## Participant attrition and follow up 1 total of 776 work samples were collected across all follow up points. To ensure that the data reflected the effects of training enrichments, samples from participants who completed fewer than 3 consult calls were excluded. Samples that did not adhere to study criteria (i.e., role played sessions, non SUD target behaviors, more than 7 sessions with same client) were similarly excluded, as were inaudible sessions. This resulted in a sample of 609 sessions, or 78.5% of all sessions submitted, with 81.7% at 3 months, 73.2% at 6 months and 51% at 12 months. There were no between group differences on the number of work samples submitted at any follow up (all p > 0.25), nor were there any differences between groups in the number of consult calls completed (t(189) = 0.404, p > 0.60, d = 0.0594). ## Interrater reliability estimates for coding of worksamples A subset of 72 randomly selected recordings (11.8%) were coded by the 6 coders completing the majority (84.7%) of all recordings. Intraclass correlations (ICC's) across all 6 coders for behavior counts ranged from 0.59 to 0.99 (Cicchetti, 1994). For this reliability sample, 34.7% of the total tapes were drawn from MIU, 65.3% from LEAF, (t(71) = 2.704, p < 0.01), indicating that despite random selection the LEAF condition was oversampled. (See [Table 3](#) for all reliability estimates. Our analyses examined client language both 1) at the 3 month follow up and 2) in all follow up periods simultaneously. Mediation analyses focused on the 3 month follow up period. We used the PROCESS software (Hayes, 2013) to examine the relationship between group assignment and client language, mediated by the directional reflections of the providers (a strategy emphasized in the MI Leaf condition). It was administered at baseline and post training, and results indicate a significant increase in MI knowledge (b = 0.111, SE = 0.015, t = 7.146, p < 0.001) for all participants with no significant differences between training conditions (b = −0.041, SE = 0.031, t = −1.328, p = 0.186). ### Frequency counts of outcome variables As expected, common MI skills that were common to both treatment conditions, such as providing complex reflections (b = 0.063, SE = 0.080, p = 0.43, CI[0.910--1.247] and asking open questions (b = −0.087, SE = 0.071, p = 0.221, CI[0.797--1.054], showed no significant differences between training conditions. Collapsing across all time points, the frequency of the participants' reflections of client CT did not differ between groups as hypothesized (b = 0.037, SE = 0.097, p = 0.703, 95% CI [−0.155 to 0.230], d = 0.062). However for reflections of ST, there was a significant difference such that participants in the LEAF MI group gave fewer reflections of sustain talk than those in the MI AU training (b = −0.257, SE = 0.114, p = 0.025, CI [−0.032 to 0.481], d = −0.369). For the 3 month follow up, the frequency of client CT did not differ significantly in the treatment sessions as a result of training condition, contradicting our hypothesis (b = −0.0857, SE = 0.0923, 95% CI [0.765, 1.102), T = −0.929, p = 0.355. However, ST was significantly lower for clients of participants trained in the MI LEAF condition (b = −0.1008, SE = 0.0179, 95% CI [0.873, 0.937), T = −5.629, p < 0.001) as hypothesized. Frequency of client CT did not differ significantly between the training groups, (b = −0.018, SE = 0.064, p = 0.781, CI [−0.0145, 0.110], T = −0.279, p = 0.781 However, ST was significantly lower for the clients of participants trained in the LEAF MI condition (b = −0.175, SE = 0.087, p = 0.046, CI [−0.347, 0.003], T = −2.01, p = 0.046). ## Is there evidence for a causal chain implicating specialized training, resulting participant's reflections of client language and the frequencies of client language at the 3 month follow up? A priori mediation analyses focusing on change talk were not significant (K2 = 0.0295, bootstrap SE = 0.0556, 95% CI [0.000, 0.912]). For sustain talk, however, the causal chain for a) training and b) subsequent participant focus on sustain talk in follow up sessions and c) client sustain talk during those same sessions was significant (K2 = 0.0833, bootstrap SE = 0.0394, 95% CI [0.0148, 0.1691]). Specifically, group assignment (C path) predicted client speech in follow up sessions, but this was mediated by the type of reflections used by the provider (B path) such that those who had been trained in the MI Leaf condition offered fewer reflections of sustain talk (A path) (See [Table 4](#) ).

      "We reviewed nonfatal myocardial infarctions (MIs) reported by site investigators in the international Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin (Eptifibatide) Therapy (PURSUIT) trial and those adjudicated by 1 central clinical events committee (CEC) to determine the reasons for differences in event rates. ## Methods The PURSUIT trial randomised 10,948 patients with acute coronary syndromes to receive eptifibatide or placebo. The primary end point was death or post enrolment MI at 30 days as assessed by the CEC; this end point was also constructed using site reported events. ## Results The CEC identified 5005 (46%) suspected events, of which 1415 (28%) were adjudicated as MI. The site investigator and CEC assessments of whether a MI had occurred disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients with suspected MI, mostly reflecting site misclassification of post enrolment MIs (as enrolment MIs) or underreported periprocedural MIs. Patients for whom the CEC and site investigator agreed that no end point MI had occurred had the lowest mortality at 30 days and between 30 days and 6 months, and those with agreement that a MI had occurred had the highest mortality. # Results ## Incidence of disagreement Overall, 5005 (46%) patients with possible or suspected MI were identified and adjudicated by the CEC. The CEC identified more patients with end point events than did the site investigators (13.6% versus 7.7% for placebo, 12.6% versus 6.2% for eptifibatide). The CEC and site investigator assessments of MI disagreed for 9% of all patients enrolled in the PURSUIT trial. The CEC identified MIs in 1415 of the 5005 patients with suspected MI. The site investigator and the CEC assessments disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients. Of these 983 patients with disagreements, 816 patients had a MI identified by the CEC but not the site investigator, and 167 patients had a MI identified by site investigator but not the CEC. ## Reasons for disagreement Most often, when the site investigator had identified a MI and the CEC had not, the investigator had misclassified a MI at enrolment as an end point MI, although by protocol these were not end point events (Table [1](#)). Recurrent ischemic events without elevated cardiac enzymes or ECG evidence of MI were also incorrectly identified by site investigators as MIs (Table [1](#)). In cases where the CEC had identified a MI and the site investigators had not, 1/3 of those identified were MIs defined by enzyme elevations without clinical or ECG evidence of ischemia or infarction (Table [2](#)). Enzyme elevations after bypass surgery accounted for 25% of these cases. Patients with clinically evident ischemia reported by the site investigator and associated with cardiac enzyme elevations were not reported as MIs by investigators in 27% of the cases of disagreement (Table [2](#)).table wrap\n",

HBV markers and HBV DNA were monitored during immunization and 24 weeks after the completion of immunization. Statistical significance was not reached in primary endpoints 4 weeks after the end of treatment among 3 groups, however, at the end of follow up, HBeAg sero conversion rate was 21.8%(17/78) and 9% (7/78) in the 60 µg YIC and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.03), with 95% confidence intervals at 1.5% to 24.1%. Using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) model, a significant difference of group effects was found between 60 µg YIC and the placebo groups in terms of the primary endpoint. 11 serious adverse events occurred, which were 5.1%, 3.6%, and 5.0% in the placebo, 30 µg YIC and 60 µg YIC groups respectively (p>0.05). ## Conclusions Though statistical differences in the preset primary and secondary endpoints among the 3 groups were not reached, a late and promising HBeAg seroconversion effect was shown in the 60 µg YIC immunized regimen. ## Trial Registration ChiCTR.org [ChiCTR TRC-00000022](#) # Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients 354 hepatitis B patients were evaluated for the inclusion criteria. Of these, 242 patients were eligible and assigned randomly to placebo, 30 µg YIC and 60 µg YIC groups in a 3 month period. 5 patients were found ineligible during the batch assay at the end of treatment (week 24) at the central laboratory, and therefore were excluded from the intent to treat analysis. Of 237 patients included in the analysis , 8 receiving placebo, 5 receiving 30ug YIC, and 10 receiving 60ug YIC either did not complete the treatment, did not complete the follow up or violated the protocol ( [Figure 1](#) ). No significant difference was found in baseline characteristics among 3 groups ( [Table 1](#) ). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pone.0002565.g001 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Summary of participants.<br /> Footnote: The numbers of SAE patients are those who discontinued treatment, while other SAE patients are not included in this figure.</figcaption> </figure>table wrap\n",

After the participants completed the cognitive tasks at rest, they cycled the ergometer until their heart rate (HR) reached 160 beats/min. Then, they cycled for 10 min while keeping their HR at 160 beats/min. The cognitive tasks were performed 3 min after their HR reached 160 beats/min. The air temperature was maintained at 35°C and the relative humidity was controlled at 70%. The accuracy of the cognitive tasks was lower during exercise than that at rest in the Hot and Hot + Cooling condition (p < 0.05). There were no differences in the accuracy between the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions (p = 0.98). Neither exercise (p = 0.40) nor cooling (p = 0.86) affected reaction time. # Results and discussion ## Exercise intensity and HR Table [1](#) shows exercise intensity and HR after the participants reached a HR of 160 beats/min. We observed a significant main effect of Time Course (F [9,63] = 45.02, p < 0.001, η^2^ = 0.87) on exercise intensity. There were no significant main effect of Condition (F [1,7] = 1.62, p = 0.24, η^2^ = 0.19) and interaction (F [9,63] = 1.01, p = 0.44, η^2^ = 0.13). Similarly, we found a significant main effect of Time Course (F [9,63] = 6.39, p < 0.001, η^2^ = 0.48) on HR. There were no significant main effect of Condition (F [1,7] = 2.91, p = 0.13, η^2^ = 0.29) and interaction (F [9,63] = 0.81, p = 0.61, η^2^ = 0.10).

The Spatial DR task requires working memory [[25](#), [29](#)]. The Go/No Go task requires executive function, including selective attention, response inhibition and interference control [[30](#), [31](#)]. The prefrontal and parietal cortices play a key role in spatial working memory [[32](#) -[35](#)]. Activation in the prefrontal cortex is crucial for executive function [[36](#), [37](#)]. Furthermore, the frontopolar cortex, which is located at the most anterior part of the frontal cortex, is selectively activated in multi tasking where execution of the primary task was maintained in a pending state while performing a secondary task [[38](#)]. In the present study, HR was maintained at 160 beats/min during exercise. Indeed, RPE was approximately 16 immediately after the cognitive tasks during exercise. Furthermore, blood lactate concentration increased above 5 mmol/l after exercise in both conditions. Skin cooling may reduce thermal strain and/or discomfort at rest and during exercise [[5](#), [9](#) -[13](#)]. Previous studies indicated that head and neck cooling with frozen packs prevented the impairment of short term memory [[14](#), [39](#)]. The present results are in line with the findings showing that skin cooling did not reduce body temperature [[9](#) -[11](#), [40](#)]. Dehydration is 1 of the potential factors that may impair cognitive function in a hot environment. Indeed, weight reduction was less than 0.5% in the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions. Previous studies suggested that dehydration may impair complex cognitive tasks when weight reduction was greater than 2% [[21](#), [22](#), [39](#)]. [[39](#)] suggested that, when weight reduction did not exceed 0.5%, fluid replacement is adequate and dehydration does not alter cognitive function. Previous studies indicated that nerve conduction velocity increases in the hot environment [[14](#), [39](#)]. It has been suggested that increase in arousal level induced by exercise affect cognitive function [[41](#), [42](#)].\n",
      "# Abstract ## BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity prevention during adolescence is 1 health priority. The 'Physical Activity 4 Everyone' (PA4E1) study tested a multi component physical activity intervention in 10 secondary schools from socio economically disadvantaged communities. This paper aimed to report the secondary outcomes of the study; to determine whether the intervention impacted on adiposity outcomes (weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI *z* score), and whether any effect was moderated by sex, baseline BMI and baseline physical activity level, at 12 and 24 months. The school based intervention included 7 physical activity strategies targeting the following: curriculum (strategies to maximise physical activity in physical education, student physical activity plans, an enhanced school sport programme); school environment (physical activity during school breaks, modification of school policy); and parents and the community (parent engagement, links with community physical activity providers). Students' weight (kg), BMI and BMI *z* score, were collected at baseline (Grade 7), 12 and 24 months. Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between group mean difference from baseline to 12 and 24 months. Exploratory sub analyses were undertaken according to 3 moderators of energy balance. ## RESULTS: A total of 1150 students (mean age=12 years) provided outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91%) at 12 months and 985 (86%) at 24 months. At 12 months, there were group by time effects for weight (mean difference= -0.90 kg (95% confidence interval (CI)= -1.50, −0.30), *P*<0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.50, −0.06), *P*=0.01) in favour of the intervention group, but not for BMI *z* score (−0.05 (−0.11; 0.01), *P*=0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (−0.62 kg (−1.21, 0.03), *P*=0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.49, −0.06), *P*=0.01) at 24 months, with group by time effects also found for BMI *z* score (−0.08 (−0.14; −0.02), *P*=0.02) favouring the intervention group. ## CONCLUSION: The PA4E1 school based intervention achieved moderate reductions in adiposity among adolescents from socio economically disadvantaged communities. # Results ## Sample Of the 22 eligible schools, 13 were approached to participate in the study. 10 schools consented to participate (77%) and parental consent was obtained for 1233 of the 1468 Grade-7 students in the 10 schools (84%). A total of 1150 students provided adiposity outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91%) at mid point (12 months) and 985 (86%) at 24 months. Demographic characteristics of the sample at baseline, 12 and 24 months are outlined in [Table 1](#). At baseline, the mean age of participants was 12 years, 51% were female, 17% were overweight and 5% were obese, and 64% did not meet the physical activity recommendation of ⩾60 min of MVPA per day. Participants who were lost to follow up were more likely to be older in age (*P*=0.03) and did not speak English as a primary language (*P*=0.02) compared with those who provided outcome data at all time points. At 24 months, all 5 intervention schools had implemented 6 of the 7 physical activity strategies. The exception was strategy 5 (school policy); 4 of the 5 schools had developed a school policy. The majority of intervention group PE teachers (*n*=35) reported using pedometers to increase activity levels in PE (88.9%), and 58.8% reported including student physical activity plans each term. All schools were represented by at least 1 PE teacher (range 1--5) at each professional learning workshop. More information on intervention delivery can be found in the 24-month physical activity outcome paper.^[16](#)^ ## Indicators of adiposity The results for the 12- and 24-month adiposity outcomes are presented in [Table 2](#). At 12 months, there were group by time effects for weight (mean difference (95% CI) =−0.90 kg (−1.50; −0.30), *P*<0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.50; −0.06), *P*=0.01) in favour of the intervention group, but not for BMI *z* score (−0.05 (−0.11; 0.01), *P*=0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (−0.62 kg (−1.21; −0.03), *P*=0.01) and BMI (−0.28 kg m^−2^ (−0.49; −0.06), *P*=0.01) at 24 months, with group by time effects also found for BMI *z* score (−0.08 (−0.14; −0.02), *P*=0.02) favouring the intervention group. Intervention effects were significant for all adiposity outcomes at 12 and 24 months in both the complete cases and multiple imputation analyses ([Supplementary Appendix 1 and 2](#)). ## Subgroup analyses The results of the subgroup analyses are presented in [Supplementary Appendix 3](#). ### Sex There was weak evidence of a differential treatment on effect on weight in males compared with females (3 way interaction *P*=0.22). Among males there was a statistically significant treatment effect at 24 months in favour of the intervention group (−1.26 kg (−2.11; −0.41), *P*=0.01). There were no significant effects on weight, BMI and BMI *z* score at either 12 or 24 months for females. ### Weight status at baseline We found very little evidence of differential treatment effects depending on baseline weight for weight (*P*=0.50), BMI (*P*=0.57) or BMI *z* score (*P*=0.64). Among underweight and normal weight participants combined, there were significant effects for weight (−0.71 kg (−1.28; −0.14), *P*=0.04), BMI (−0.33 kg m^−2^ (−0.55; −0.10), *P*=0.01) and BMI *z* score (−0.08 (−0.15; −0.01), *P*=0.01) in favour of the intervention group at 12-month follow up. Similar findings for weight (−0.71 kg (−1.28; −0.14), *P*=0.04), BMI (−0.33 kg m^−2^ (−0.55; −0.10), *P*=0.01) and BMI *z* score (−0.08 (−0.15; −0.01), *P*=0.01) in underweight/normal weight participants were found at 24 months in favour of the intervention group. Among overweight and obese students, no significant effects were found at 12 or 24 months for weight (12 months=−1.29 kg (−3.12; 0.53), *P*=0.16; 24 months=−1.16 kg (−2.98; 0.67), *P*=0.30), BMI (12 months=−0.39 kg m^−2^ (−1.01; 0.22), *P*=0.21; 24 months=−0.18 kg m^−2^ (−0.80; 0.44), *P*=0.45) and BMI *z* score (12 months=−0.07 (−0.21; 0.07), *P*=0.31; 24 months=−0.00 (−0.14; 0.14), *P*=0.54). ### Physical activity level at baseline We found no evidence of differential treatment effects depending on activity status at baseline for weight (*P*=0.94), BMI (*P*=0.95) or BMI *z* score (*P*=0.31).There was no significant effect on weight, BMI or BMI *z* score for either active or inactive students at 12 or 24 months.table wrap\n",

      "We compared the efficacy of 1 heart failure self management program designed for patients with low literacy versus usual care. ## Methods We performed a 12-month randomized controlled trial. From November 2001 to April 2003, we enrolled participants aged 30--80, who had heart failure and took furosemide. ## Results 123 patients (64 control, 59 intervention) participated; 41% had inadequate literacy. Patients in the intervention group had a lower rate of hospitalization or death (crude incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.69; CI 0.4, 1.2; adjusted IRR = 0.53; CI 0.32, 0.89). This difference was larger for patients with low literacy (IRR = 0.39; CI 0.16, 0.91) than for higher literacy (IRR = 0.56; CI 0.3, 1.04), but the interaction was not statistically significant. At 12 months, more patients in the intervention group reported monitoring weights daily (79% vs. 29%, p < 0.0001). After adjusting for baseline demographic and treatment differences, we found no difference in heart failure related quality of life at 12 months (difference = -2; CI -5, +9). # Results ## Patients We screened 919 patients on furosemide between November 2001 and April 2003. 127 met eligibility criteria and agreed to participate (Figure [2](#)). Of those not enrolled, 407 did not have heart failure according to their physician, 367 did not meet eligibility criteria and 27 declined to participate. Of those randomized to the control group, 1 never returned after the 1st visit, 1 withdrew during the study and 4 died during the study. Follow up was completed for all of the remaining participants (98%) (Figure [3](#)). Of those randomized to the intervention group, 3 never returned after the first visit, 4 withdrew during the study and 3 died during the study. Follow up was completed for all of the remaining participants (93%). At baseline, most characteristics were similar between the 2 groups (Table [1](#)). ## Hospitalization or death There were 68 hospitalizations (65) or deaths (3) in the intervention group and 111 (107 hospitalizations, 4 deaths) in the control group. The crude all cause hospital admission or death incidence rate ratio (IRR) was 0.69 (95% CI 0.40, 1.19). After adjusting for age, gender, use of ACE inhibitor or ARB, use of a β blocker, presence of hypertension, and baseline MLHF, intervention patients were less likely to have the outcome (IRR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32, 0.89). 61% of patients in the control group had at least 1 hospitalization or died, and 42% of patients in the intervention group had at least 1 hospitalization or died (p = 0.13). ## Cardiac hospitalization 39% of patients in the control group and 34% of patients in the intervention group had at least 1 hospitalization for cardiac causes (p = 0.55). The unadjusted IRR was 0.79 (95% CI 0.42, 1.5). After adjusting for baseline differences, the IRR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.44, 1.7). ## Heart failure related quality of life In unadjusted analysis, the control group, on average, improved 5 points on the MLHF and the intervention group improved by 1 point. The difference was not statistically significant (3.5 points, 95% CI 11, -4, p = 0.36). After adjusting for baseline differences between the groups, the difference was 2 points (95% CI 9, -5, p = 0.59) suggesting no effect on heart failure related quality of life. Mean difference in score improvement was 12 percentage points (95% CI 6, 18; p < 0.001). Mean difference in score improvement was 2 points (95% CI 0.7, 3.1; p = 0.0026). ### Self care behavior Significantly more patients in the intervention group than in the control group reported daily weight measurement at 12 months (79% vs. 29%, p < 0.001). ## Subgroup analyses according to literacy 24 patients in each group had inadequate literacy based on the S TOFHLA (Table [2](#)). Among these patients, there was no difference in quality of life score in unadjusted and adjusted analyses (difference = -1.6; 95% CI -15, 12); p = 0.81). For the combined outcome of hospitalization or death, the unadjusted IRR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.30, 1.94). After adjusting for baseline differences, the IRR was 0.39 (95% CI 0.16, 0.91). 75 patients had marginal or adequate literacy based on the S TOFHLA. We found no difference in quality of life score in unadjusted and adjusted analyses (difference = -4.2; 95% CI -14, 6; p = 0.40). Among patients in the higher literacy group, the unadjusted IRR for hospitalization or death was 0.65 (95% CI 0.33, 1.3). After adjusting for baseline differences, the IRR was 0.56 (95% CI 0.30, 1.04).:::\n",

      "In this cluster randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether lumefantrine (AL). We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, *p* [adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, *p* [adjusted] = 0.9). # Results [Figure 1](#) shows the trial profile. Of the 82 randomized ADDOs, 37 from the control arm and 40 from the intervention arm participated in the study. The number of registered patients eligible for follow up was 537 in the control arm and 518 in the intervention arm, with ∼15% of patients in each arm lost to follow up. Most outlets were in urban wards (70% in both arms), had 1 single dispenser, and had at least some ACTs in stock on the day of interview ([Table 1](#)). Of 51 dispensers in the control arm and 59 in the intervention arm, ∼80% in both arms were female and had a low level medical qualification, mostly nurse assistants ([Table 2](#)). Though low in both arms, more ADDOs in the control arm compared with the intervention arm were able to show an accreditation certificate (43% versus 20%, respectively). However, the difference in the percentages of dispensers that had received training on ACTs was not as pronounced (69% in the control arm versus 60% in the intervention arm), though the median year of training was more recent in the control arm (2011 versus 2009). Characteristics of patients were well balanced between arms ([Table 3](#)). A high percentage of patients (36% in the control arm and 38% in the intervention arm) had sought care before attending the study ADDO, with most patients going to a kiosk or general shop and only 7% of patients in the control arm and 4% in the intervention arm going to a public health facility. Approximately 90% reported symptoms of fever or headache, and approximately1/2 had upset stomachs or nausea. Based on an mRDT taken at the time of follow up, 28% in the control arm and 25% in the intervention arm tested positive, with only 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively, testing positive by study blood smear. (Some degree of discrepancy is expected because of the persistence of HRP2 detected by the mRDT.) 70 percent of dispensers received at least 75% of the text messages. The median percentage of messages received was 86%, with 20% of dispensers receiving no messages ([Figure 3](#)). [Table 4](#) presents results of the dispenser interviews on knowledge of advice to provide patients when dispensing AL. Dispensers in the intervention arm reported slightly better knowledge of the correct AL regimen for adults in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (90% versus 78%; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95, 1.5); *p* [adjusted] = 0.0748), though knowledge of the correct regimen for a child aged 4 weighing 20 kg was lower than for adults in both arms (75% versus 64%; aPR = 1.2 [0.85, 1.7]; *p* [adjusted] = 0.2). Dispenser knowledge was considerably higher in the intervention arm than the control arm on advice to take AL with fatty food (60% versus 20%; aPR = 3.4 [95% CI: 1.6, 7.1]; *p* [adjusted] < 0.0001) and to continue to take AL if minor side effects occur (68% versus 43%; aPR = 1.6 [95% CI: 1.0, 2.4]; *p* [adjusted] = 0.0188). However, surprisingly high dispenser knowledge (87--99%) was recorded in both arms on advice to complete treatment even if feeling better, advice to return to the ADDO or go to a health facility if the condition worsens, and advice to take the 2nd dose after 8 hours ([Table 4](#)). Knowledge on advising patients to take a replacement dose in case of vomiting within 1/2 an hour of taking a dose was lower (55% versus 50%), with no difference observed between arms. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Percentage of text messages received by dispensers in the intervention arm.</figcaption> </figure> [Table 5](#) shows that ∼60% of patients in both arms reported being told how to take AL correctly, with similar percentages reporting being told to take the 2nd dose after 8 hours and to complete treatment even if feeling better, indicating that dispensers were providing some advice even in the absence of the intervention. Less than 5% of patients in both arms reported being told about vomiting, side effects, or taking AL with fatty food, and < 10% in both arms took the first dose of AL at the ADDO. There was no difference in patient adherence between arms ([Table 6](#)). Completed treatment was 70% in the control arm and 68% in the intervention arm (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 0.96 [95% CI: 0.82, 1.1]; *p* [adjusted] = 0.6), with a similar percentage of patients adherent to each of the 4 age appropriate blister packs and no important differences between arms. The mean number of doses taken by non adherent patients was 4 in both arms, and the most common reported reasons for non adherence included planning to take the medication later, forgetting to take the tablets, feeling better, and other reasons ([Figure 4](#)). Timely completion was much lower, with 33% of patients in both arms taking all doses at appropriate times. A per protocol analysis, excluding patients attending ADDOs where at least 1 dispenser did not receive any messages, had no impact on results.table wrap\n",

      "## Methods 66 healthy adult volunteers (32 men) who did not have 1 daily defecation habit had a 7-day run in period before the 21-day intervention period with RMD or placebo. ## Results 57 subjects were assessed for CTT (placebo, *n* = 28; RMD, *n* = 29). In the RMD group, the total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT decreased significantly compared to baseline (*p* < 0.01 each; −13.3, −4.7, −8.7 h, respectively). Significant time by treatment interaction was observed in the RMD group for stool volume (*p* = 0.014), increasing 56 % compared to baseline (*p* < 0.01), while remained unchanged in the placebo group. Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (*p* < 0.01). # Results ## Baseline data A total of 73 candidates were assessed for eligibility, and 67 subjects met the criteria and were randomly allocated into 2 groups. 1 subject was withdrawn during the run in period before receiving intervention (Fig. [1](#)). Thus, a total of 66 subjects were analysed, 33 in each study group. The demographic and other baseline characteristics of subjects in each group are outlined in Table [1](#). Briefly, the population was 51.5 % female with the mean age of 21.3 years and the mean BMI 23.0 kg/m^2^. The 2 study groups were well balanced with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics, and no significant difference was found in any of the variables between groups. The mean daily fibre intake was 10.0 ± 4.6 g in the RMD group and 11.5 ± 4.6 g in the placebo group.table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## OBJECTIVE Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes but less so in children. We designed 1 study to assess CGM benefit in young children aged 4 to 9 years with type 1 diabetes. ## RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS After a run in phase, 146 children with type 1 diabetes (mean age 7.5 ± 1.7 years, 64% on pumps, median diabetes duration 3.5 years) were randomly assigned to CGM or to usual care. The primary outcome was reduction in HbA~1c~ at 26 weeks by ≥0.5% without the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia. ## RESULTS The primary outcome was achieved by 19% in the CGM group and 28% in the control group (*P* = 0.17). Mean change in HbA~1c~ was −0.1% in each group (*P* = 0.79). CGM wear decreased over time, with only 41% averaging at least 6 days/week at 26 weeks. There was no correlation between CGM use and change in HbA~1c~ (*r~s~* = −0.09, *P* = 0.44). ## CONCLUSIONS CGM in 4- to 9-year olds did not improve glycemic control despite a high degree of parental satisfaction with CGM. # RESULTS Between January 2009 and December 2010, the trial randomized 146 children aged 4.0--9.9 years (7.5 ± 1.7 years [mean ± SD]) who had a median duration of type 1 diabetes of 3.5 years (interquartile range 2.2--5.2). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups ([Table 1](#)). HbA~1c~ decreased by a mean of 0.2 ± 0.7% (measured with a DCA instrument) during the run in phase. Mean HbA~1c~ at the time of randomization (measured by central laboratory) was 7.9 ± 0.8% in each treatment group. Total daily insulin dose averaged 0.8 ± 0.2 units/kg/day in both treatment groups at baseline and at 26 weeks. The 26-week primary outcome visit was completed by 69 of 74 participants (93%) in the CGM group and 68 of 72 (94%) in the control group, with 5 and 4 participants in the 2 treatment groups, respectively, discontinuing study participation prior to completion of the 26-week visit ([Supplementary Fig. A1](#)). The overall completion rates for the 6 follow up visits and the 6 protocol specified phone calls were 93% and 94% in the CGM and control groups, respectively. Among the 74 participants in the CGM group, 10 (14%) were provided with a Paradigm CGM device and 64 (86%) with a Navigator CGM device. No participants in the control group self initiated CGM prior to completing the 26-week visit. ## Glycemic control The primary outcome of a decrease from randomization to 26 weeks in HbA~1c~ ≥0.5% with no severe hypoglycemic events occurred in 13 of 69 (19%) participants in the CGM group and 19 of 68 (28%) in the control group (*P* = 0.17). Mean change in HbA~1c~ was similar between groups (−0.1 ± 0.6 in each group, *P* = 0.79) ([Supplementary Fig. A2](#)). Other HbA~1c~ outcomes at 26 weeks showed similar comparability between treatment groups ([Table 2](#)). Outcomes in subgroups based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, parent education level, insulin modality (pump vs. MDIs), baseline HbA~1c~, or BMI also did not differ between groups and are shown in [Supplementary Table A1](#).table wrap\n",

      "! Glycemic outcomes measured with CGM showed no significant differences between treatment groups (considering the multiple outcomes assessed) with respect to percent of values within, above, and below the target range ([Table 2](#) and [Supplementary Table A2](#)). Participants in both groups had glucose values >250 mg/dL for >20% of the day. ## Hypoglycemia and other adverse events 3 participants (4%, 3 total events) in the CGM group and 5 participants (7%, 6 total events) in the control group experienced at least 1 severe hypoglycemic event, with no significant differences comparing treatment groups (incidence rate = 8.6 and 17.6 per 100 person years, respectively; *P* = 0.80) ([Table 2](#)). At 26 weeks, both groups had CGM glucose values ≤60 mg/dL for <1% of the day. ## Frequency of sensor use in the CGM group A total of 63 (91%) of 69 participants who completed the 26-week visit were wearing a sensor on at least 1 day a week at the end of 26 weeks. The amount of CGM sensor wear decreased during the 26 weeks of the study (*P* < 0.001) ([Fig. 1](#)), with only 41% averaging at least 6 days/week of wear in month 6. The amount of sensor wear in month 6 did not vary with age overall (*r* = −0.07) and was not associated with baseline HbA~1c~ (*r* = −0.02). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Sensor use during the 26 weeks of the trial. Each box represents the number of hours per week of CGM sensor glucose data averaged over 4 weeks. The top and bottom of the boxes represent the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively; the horizontal line within each box represents the median; and the black dot represents the mean. For participants who dropped from the trial, sensor use was considered to be 0 after the day of dropout. Data were considered missing when downloaded glucose data were not available for a 4-week period. *Sensor download was unavailable due to device issue for 1 subject in 22–26 weeks.</figcaption> </figure> There was no association between change in HbA~1c~ from baseline to 26 weeks and the overall amount of CGM sensor wear during the entire 26 weeks (Spearman *r~s~* = −0.09, *P* = 0.44) or during month 6 (Spearman *r~s~* = −0.11, *P* = 0.37). However, the 28 participants who wore a sensor ≥6 days/week during month 6 tended to have a slightly greater reduction in HbA~1c~ compared with the 41 participants who wore a sensor less frequently (mean change from baseline to 26 weeks −0.3 ± 0.7% vs. 0.0 ± 0.5%, *P* = 0.01; 25 vs. 15% with a reduction in HbA~1c~ ≥0.5% without a severe hypoglycemia event, *P* = 0.33). Among those wearing a sensor ≥6 days/week in month 6, the median percentage of glucose values in the target range of 71--180 mg/dL was 51%, with 38% >200 mg/dL, 16% >250 mg/dL, and 0.3% ≤60 mg/dL compared with 43, 44, 23, and 0.4%, respectively, in those wearing a sensor less frequently. ## Quality of life assessments At 26 weeks, there were no significant differences between treatment groups on the Hypoglycemia Fear or the PAID questionnaire survey scores ([Table 2](#) and [Supplementary Tables A3 and A6](#)). However, scores on the Blood Glucose Monitoring System Rating Scale were indicative of fewer problems/concerns perceived by the CGM group compared with the control group ([Table 2](#) and [Supplementary Table A5](#)). On the CGM Satisfaction Scale at 26 weeks ([Table 3](#) and [Supplementary Table A4](#)), parents generally reported a high degree of satisfaction with CGM, with an average item score of 3.9 and 86% of scores ≥3.5 (on a 5-point Likert type scale, with 3 being neutral). Mean item scores were more favorable than neutral (>3.0) on all 43 items. Scores on the Benefits of CGM subscale tended to be slightly higher than scores on the Lack of Hassles of CGM subscale (mean 4.1 ± 0.4 vs. 3.9 ± 0.6, respectively). It is particularly noteworthy that >90% of parents responded that use of CGM makes adjusting insulin easier, shows patterns in blood glucose not seen before, and makes them feel safer knowing that they will be warned about low blood glucose before it happens. No 1 responded that he or she would not recommend CGM for other children with type 1 diabetes.table wrap\n",

      "Self determination theory (SDT) provides 1 useful framework to understand the nature of motivational interviewing (MI). ## Methods 70 women in reproductive age were selected by clustering sampling method for this randomized controlled trial. The intervention group (n=35) received 4 MI sessions through theory and 1 standard education session about PA. The control group (n=35) received a standard education session about PA. ## Results 4 months after the intervention, an increase in the mean scores of total PA (p<0.001, ES=4.77), physical fitness tests including flexibility (p<0.001, ES=1.59), muscular endurance (p<0.001, ES=2.0), cardiorespiratory endurance (p<0.001, ES=0.51), and a decrease in mean scores of agility test (p<0.001, ES= − 0.51) and sedentary behavior (p<0.01, ES=− 0.74) was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of intrinsic motivation (p<0.001, ES=3.34), identified regulation (p<0.001, ES= 1.28), perceptions of competence (p<0.001, ES=0.81) and autonomy (p<0.001, ES=2.01), enjoyment (p<0.001, ES=0.98) and health motives (p<0.01, ES=0.19), health care climate (p<0.001, ES=4.6), and a decreased score of external regulation (p<0.01, ES=−0.55) and amotivation (p<0.01, ES= −0.56) over time, compared to the control group. ## Conclusion MI based intervention using SDT was effective on the promotion of PA. ## Trial registration The Trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial ([http://www.irct.ir](#)) with the Irct ID: IRCT2015101924592N1. # 3. Results 70 women in reproductive age were randomly assigned to the randomized controlled trial. With Chi squared test, no significant difference was observed between intervention and control groups regarding the demographic characteristics (age, educational level, job, spouse's job) and body composition (p>0.05). ## 3.1. SDT components The results of the psychological variables of SDT are shown in [Table 2](#). Friedman's non parametric test also showed an increased intrinsic motivation, introjected regulation, perception of self determination and fitness/health motive and a reduction in amotivation in the intervention group compared to before intervention over time ([Table 2](#)). Comparing the intervention and control groups within 4 months, variables such as intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, perception of autonomy, perception of competence and perception of relatedness, enjoyment motive, and health care climate, indicated moderate to high effect sizes. Conversely, introjected regulation, external regulation, amotivation and fitness/health, challenge, social and appearance motives, showed low or negative effect sizes ([Table 3](#)). ## 3.2. Physical activity and sedentary behavior With repeated measures tests, the participants in the intervention group showed a higher level of PA over time and a lower level of sedentary behavior in the non parametric Friedman test compared to pre intervention time ([Table 2](#)). Within 4 months after intervention, the subjects in the intervention group showed higher level of PA with high effect size and lower level of sedentary behavior with negative effect size compared with the control group. ## 3.3. Body composition and physical fitness tests In the intervention group, the repeated measures tests showed a significant reduction in body mass index, and paired t test showed a significant increase in body flexibility, muscle endurance, and cardiorespiratory endurance and a significant reduction in agility score over time ([Table 2](#)). The subjects in the intervention group indicated lower scores of body mass index and agility, with a negative effect size and higher levels of cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular endurance and flexibility of the body with medium to high effect sizes, in 4 months after intervention compared with the control group ([Table 4](#)).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, as 1 consequence of preterm birth, is a major cause of early mortality and morbidity. ## Methods Women with a live singleton or twin pregnancy between 18 to <24 weeks' gestation and a history of prior preterm birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation in the preceding pregnancy, where labour occurred spontaneously or in association with cervical incompetence or following preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, were eligible. Women were recruited from 39 Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian maternity hospitals and assigned by randomisation to vaginal progesterone pessaries (equivalent to 100 mg vaginal progesterone) (*n* = 398) or placebo (*n* = 389). Data were analysed for all the 787 women (100%) randomised and their 799 infants. ## Findings Most women used their allocated study treatment (740 women, 94.0%), with median use similar for both study groups (51.0 days, interquartile range [IQR] 28.0--69.0, in the progesterone group versus 52.0 days, IQR 27.0--76.0, in the placebo group). The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was similar in both study groups --10.5% (42/402) in the progesterone group and 10.6% (41/388) in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64--1.49, *p* = 0.912) --as was the severity of any neonatal respiratory disease (adjusted treatment effect 1.02, 95% CI 0.69--1.53, *p* = 0.905). No differences were seen between study groups for other respiratory morbidities and adverse infant outcomes, including serious infant composite outcome (155/406 [38.2%] in the progesterone group and 152/393 [38.7%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82--1.17, *p* = 0.798). The proportion of infants born before 37 weeks' gestation was similar in both study groups (148/406 [36.5%] in the progesterone group and 146/393 [37.2%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81--1.17, *p* = 0.765). In 9.9% (39/394) of the women in the progesterone group and 7.3% (28/382) of the women in the placebo group, treatment was stopped because of side effects (adjusted RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.85--2.15, *p* = 0.204). The main limitation of the study was that almost 9% of the women did not start the medication or forgot to use it 3 or more times a week. ## Trial registration Current Clinical Trials [ISRCTN20269066](#). # Results ## Baseline information Of an estimated 1,919 eligible women able to be approached by the research team between February 2006 and September 2012, a total of 787 (41%) women consented to be enrolled in the study. Reasons for eligible women declining to participate included 'not interested in research' (25%), 'concerned about side effects and risks of use of drugs in pregnancy' (15%), 'no reason given' (13%), 'did not like the need to use vaginal pessaries' (9%), 'too busy' (8%), 'did not consider themselves to be at risk of preterm birth' (6%), 'partner declined to let them participate' (5), and 'other' (19%). Of the 787 women recruited, 398 (50.6%) were randomised to the progesterone group, and 389 (49.4%) to the placebo group. There were no losses to follow up, with clinical outcomes to primary hospital discharge after birth available for all 787 (100%) women and their 799 infants ([Fig 1](#)). <figure> 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002390.g001 <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram of participants in the study.</figcaption> </figure> The 2 study groups were similar at the time of study entry for maternal demographics and key variables including gestational age, the reason for the preterm birth in the preceding pregnancy, and the gestational age at which that birth occurred ([Table 1](#)). The majority of participants had a singleton pregnancy, with less than 2% having a twin pregnancy ([Table 1](#)). Almost all women recruited in both study groups used their allocated study treatment (381 [95.7%] in the progesterone group and 359 [92.3%] in the placebo group), with similar median days of use in both study groups (51.0 days [interquartile range (IQR) 28.0--69.0] in the progesterone group versus 52.0 days [IQR 27.0--76.0] in the placebo group) ([Table 1](#)).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background: Hernia is an abnormal protrusion of an organ or tissue through 1 defect in its surrounding walls which most commonly involves the abdominal wall, particularly the inguinal region. ## Materials and Methods: A quasi experimental trail of 19 males through consecutive sampling was done with selected asanas for 3 months and the outcome was measured by a questionnaire focusing on pain, aggravating factors, relieving factors and frequency of occurrence of symptoms of hernia. ## Results: The pre and post interventional data were compared statistically and found significant reduction of symptoms with *P*≤0.001 in pain, frequency of occurrence and aggravating factors. The relieving factors showed significant increase with *P*≤0.001. This includes the details about intensity of pain, relieving factors, aggravating factors and frequency of occurrence in last 2 weeks which were used for analysis along with the general information. Data analysis including descriptive analysis and inferential analysis were done by using computerized software (SPSS-11.5) Statistical package for social sciences, Version 11.5 for windows. # Descriptive statistics Descriptive statistics includes measures of central tendency specifically the median and measures of dispersion namely minimum, maximum, 1st quartile,1/3 quartile and quartile deviation for all the studied dependent variables before and after intervention. # Inferential statistics Inferential statistics of significance testing was done by using Wilcoxon signed rank test with asymptomatic 2 tailed z test for paired observations i.e. # General information 19 subjects participated in the study. # Age group Age of the subjects ranged from 24 to 46 years, with the mean of 36.26 years and standard deviation of 7.43 years. # Side involved Out of 19 subjects studied, 10 presented with left side hernia, 8 with right side hernia and remaining 1 presented with hernia on both sides. # First occurrence of the problem Out of 19 studied, 11 subjects were not able to retrieve any detail about first occurrence of the problem. For 6 subjects, the problem occurred during activity and taking rest relieved it. Remaining 2 was not clear about the exact activity during occurrence, but they gave the approximate duration of their problem. # Pain Intensity of pain was measured with numeric pain rating scale starting from 0 to 10 where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates maximum tolerable pain, which was a part of the hernia questionnaire. Pain intensity before intervention ranged from 3 to 8 with median of 6 and quartile deviation of 1. Pain intensity after intervention was from 0 to 3 with median of 1 and quartile deviation of 1 [[Table 1](#), [Figure 1](#)]. The z value of Wilcoxon signed rank test which is equal to --3.864 with *P* value<0.001 denotes that there is statistically significant reduction in pain after intervention.Pain - Maximum score 10; Agg. (aggravating factors) aximum score 5; Rel. (relieving factors) aximum score 3; Freq.

Out of 19 participated, 9 showed the presence of 3 activities, 6 showed the presence of 4 activities and remaining 4 showed the presence of all 5 activities before intervention. After 3 months of intervention with selected yogasanas, 14 subjects presented with the presence of 2 activities to increase the problem, 1 presented with 1 activity and the remaining 4 subjects presented with no activity to increase the problem out of the 5 commonly found activities. Wilcoxon signed rank test z value of --3.875 with *P*<0.001 denotes that there is statistically significant reduction in aggravating factors after yogic practice [[Table 2](#), [Figure 1](#)]. # Reliving factors The symptoms of inguinal hernia may be relieved by 3 activities which reduce the intra abdominal pressure viz. Out of 19 subjects participated, 7 showed the presence of 1 relieving factor, another 7 showed the presence of 2 relieving factors and the remaining 5 showed the presence of al 3 relieving factors before intervention. All 19 subjects showed the presence of all 3 relieving factors after intervention [Table [Table 3](#), [Figure 1](#)]. The z value of Wilcoxon signed rank test which is equal to 3.391 with *P*<0.001 denotes that there is statistically significant increase in relieving factors of inguinal hernia after intervention. number of times in last 2 weeks were also analyzed before and after intervention. The median for frequency of occurrence before intervention is 12 times with range from 9 to 14 times per 2 weeks. Frequency of occurrence reduced from 0 to 6 times with median of 2 times after practise of yoga. The z value of Wilcoxon signed rank test which is equal to --3.835 with *P* value<0.001 denotes that there is statistically significant reduction in frequency of occurrence of symptoms of hernia after intervention [[Table 4](#), [Figure 1](#)].\n",
      "# Abstract ## Background/Aims 1st line therapies against *Helicobacter pylori*, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) plus 2 antibiotics, may fail in up to 20% of patients. This study evaluated the eradication rate of bismuth containing quadruple rescue therapy over 1 1- or 2-week period. ## Methods We prospectively investigated 169 patients with a persistent *H. pylori* infection after the first line triple therapy, which was administered from October 2008 to March 2010. The patients were randomized to receive a 1- or 2-week quadruple rescue therapy (pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d., tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg q.i.d., metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d.). ## Results The 1-week group achieved 83.5% (71/85) and 87.7% (71/81) eradication rates in the intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses, respectively. The 2-week group obtained 87.7% (72/84) and 88.9% (72/81) eradication rate in the ITT and PP analyses, respectively. There was no significant difference in the eradication rate, patient compliance or rate of adverse events between the 2 groups. ## Conclusions 1 week bismuth containing quadruple therapy can be as effective as a 2-week therapy after the failure of the first line eradication therapy. # RESULTS All randomized 169 patients were eligible for ITT analysis. Among these patients, 85 patients received 1-week PPI+BMT and 84 patients received 2-week PPI+BMT. The main demographic and clinical features of 169 patients according to the 2 treatment arms are shown in [Table 1](#). Demographic characteristics were similar, except for higher proportion of patients with duodenal ulcers in the 2-week PPI+BMT group, as were symptoms at the initial assessment. Overall, 7 patients had protocol violations that excluded them from PP analysis. Among these patients, 4 patients were in the 1-week PPI+BMT treatment group. Thus, 7 patients were dropped out from PP analysis. 1](#) shows the flow diagram of patients progress through the phases of the study. The 1-week PPI+BMT regimen achieved 83.5% (95% CI, 76% to 91%) eradication rate in ITT analysis and 87.7% (95% CI, 80% to 95%) in PP analysis, while the 2-week PPI+BMT regiment obtained 87.7% (95% CI, 78% to 93%) eradication rate in ITT and 88.9% (95% CI, 82% to 96%) in PP analysis. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment modalities ([Table 2](#)). The compliance rates of the 1-week PPI+MBT group were 91.4% 'good' compliance, 9.9% 'well' compliance and 2.5% 'poor' compliance. In the 2-week PPI+MBT treatment group, the compliance rates were 91.4%, 4.6%, and 3.7%, respectively ([Table 2](#)). Overall, 52 patients reported side effects, i.e., 19 patients (22.4%) in the 1-week PPI+BMT group and 32 patients (38.1%) in the 2-week PPI+BMT group. There was no statistically significant difference in side effects between the 2 groups ([Table 3](#)). Only 1 patient from each group withdrew from the study due to significant side effects.

The 2 studied groups were similar regarding the baseline characteristics. 25 (83.4%) residents performed chest ultrasonography more than 5 times (56.7% more than 10 times) and 25 (83.3%) residents believed that chest ultrasonography for trauma patients had medium to high difficulty level. ***Outcomes*** Mean scores of the residents in the first, second, and third evaluations were 10.00 ± 0.54, 14.93 ± 0.32, and 18.72 ± 0.15, respectively. [Figure 1](#) shows the scores obtained by the residents for the 3 evaluations done based on the hospital. In both groups, obtained scores showed a significant increase from the first to the third evaluation (p < 0.001) according to Greenhouse Geisser Correction test. Mean score obtained for preparation, scan and post scan items among all residents were 3.34 ± 0.91, 9.48 ± 3.16, and 1.72 ± 0.97, respectively. [Tables 2](#) and [3](#) compare the scores obtained by each group in the 3 tests qualitatively and quantitatively. Mean scores of first and second evaluations were 10.24 ± 0.77, 17.73 ± 0.46 in feedback receivers and 9.73 ± 0.77 and 12.13 ± 0.47 in others (p < 0.001).

      "## Design 1 randomized cross over trial comparing the effect of 500 mg vs. 1500 mg dairy and nondairy calcium on fecal fat excretion in 34 healthy adults during moderate (− 30%) energy restriction diet induced weight loss for 12 weeks. ## Results Fecal fat loss expressed as percent of fat intake was significantly higher with 1500 mg (high Ca) compared to 500 mg (low Ca) calcium intake per day (mean: 3.0%; the 95% CI: 2.3 to 3.7%; *P* <0.001) independent of calcium source and lactose digestion status. # RESULTS A total of 51 volunteers were recruited for the study, 40 were randomized, and 34 completed the study (19 Caucasians, 11 African Americans, and 4 declaring other ethnicities). 1 participant was dropped due to noncompliance, and 5 withdrew between week 1 and week 8. Baseline and end of the study characteristics of participants who completed the study are shown in [Table 1](#). There was no difference in initial weight and body composition between lactose maldigesters and digesters and between dairy and nondairy diets (all *P* >0.05). ## Dietary intake and compliance with the study diets The participants had an average energy intake of 7.5 ± 1.5 MJ ([Table 2](#)). The average intake of energy from carbohydrates, fat, and protein was 54.5 ± 3.0%, 28.9 ± 2.6%, and 18.4 ± 1.85%, respectively. Average amount of calcium in low Ca and high Ca diets was 503 ± 73 and 1491 ± 131 mg/day, respectively and the level was not different between dairy and nondairy diets. Ratio of nitrogen in urine and corresponding protein intake were not significantly different between the dairy and nondairy diets (1.13 ± 0.41 and 1.01 ± 0.14, *P* = 0.105). There were also no differences between the ratios of reported intake and excretion between dairy and nondairy diets for sodium (0.96 ± 0.20 and 0.95 ± 0.19, *P* = 0.917) and potassium (1.15 ± 0.23 and 1.12 ± 0.16, *P* = 0.684). ## Fecal fat excretion The average fecal fat loss ([Table 3](#)) over 6 weeks was significantly higher with high Ca diet than that with low Ca diet after adjusting for gender, lactose digestion status, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 3.0%; the 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3 to 3.7%; *P* < 0.001). The fecal fat loss increased correspondingly with cross over to high Ca diet and vice versa ([Figure 1](#)). It was also significantly higher in females than that in males after adjusting for calcium intake level, lactose digestion status, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 2.0%; the 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.9%; *P* < 0.001). There was no significant difference in fecal fat loss between lactose digesters and maldigesters ([Figure 2](#)) after adjusting for gender, calcium intake level, and dairy or nondairy diet source (mean: 0.2%; the 95% CI: −0.5 to 1.0%; *P* = 0.544). There was a significant positive correlation between calcium intake and fecal fat excretion in dairy (r = 0.460) and nondairy (r = 0.555) diets and in lactose digesters (r = 0.562) and maldigesters (r = 0.463, all *P* >0.05). Although not statistically significant, the average fecal fat loss over 12 weeks was higher in nondairy than that in dairy diet group ([Figure 1](#)) after adjusting for calcium intake level, lactose digestion status and gender (mean: 0.5%; the 95% CI: −0.2 to 1.2%; *P* = 0.150). In females, the average fecal fat loss over 6 weeks tended to be higher with the non dairy than that with the dairy diet after adjusting for calcium intake level and lactose digestion status (mean: 0.8%; the 95% CI: −0.1 to 1.6%; *P* = 0.067). ## Urinary calcium excretion Urinary calcium excretion ([Table 4](#)) was significantly higher in high Ca than low Ca (128.3± 57.9 and 146.4 ± 77.9 mg/day^−1^; the 95% CI for difference: 3.8 to 31.1 mg/day; *P* = 0.014). The differences in calcium excretion were not different between dairy vs. nondairy diets and in digesters vs. maldigesters (all *P* > 0.05). ## Body weight and body composition After following an energy restricted diet for 12 weeks ([Table 1](#)), there were no significant differences in weight loss between dairy and nondairy diets (8.5 ± 2.7 and 7.2 ± 2.8 kg, *P* = 0.116). However, there were significant differences in weight changes in lactose digesters vs. maldigesters (9.2 ± 2.2 and 6.6 ± 2.4, *P* = 0.003). There was also significant differences between 1st and 2nd 6-week study periods (5.6± 1.8 and 2.8 ± 1.7 kg, *P*= 0.001). The differences between dairy and nondairy diets were not significant during the first 6-week (5.7 ± 1.9 and 5.5 ± 1.7 kg) or second 6-week (2.9 ± 1.9 and 2.9 ± 1.8 kg) periods. There were also no significant differences in body fat changes across groups, dairy vs. nondairy (5.4 ± 1.5 and 4.1 ± 1.5; *P* = 0.393) or lactose digesters vs. maldigesters (5.5 ± 1.3 vs. 4.8 ± 1.7; *P* = 0.206). ## Resting energy expenditure (REE) and physical activity There was a difference in REE between the baseline and the end of the study (7.31±1.31 vs. 6.74 ± 1.32 MJ) which became insignificant when REE was adjusted for fat free mass and fat mass (data not shown). There were not REE differences between digesters and maldigesters ([Table 6](#)). The differences in the amount of physical activity measured using RT3 accelerometers during the entire study were also not significant. Participants did not change physical activity level (PAL) during the study ([Table 6](#)). ## Blood pressure and blood parameters Diet had no significant effect on either systolic or diastolic blood pressure ([Table 7](#)). Diet did not have an effect on serum concentrations of insulin and vitamin D. Leptin levels decreased significantly after 12-week on the study diet independent of diet and lactose digestion status (40.6 ± 20.3 vs. 27.3 ± 16.7 ng/ml, *P* = 0.001, paired t test).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background BTH1677, 1 beta glucan pathogen associated molecular pattern molecule, drives an anti cancer immune response in combination with oncology antibody therapies. This phase II study explored the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of BTH1677 combined with bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with untreated advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ## Methods Patients were randomized to the BTH1677 arm (*N* = 61; intravenous [IV] BTH1677, 4 mg/kg, weekly; IV bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg, once each 3-week cycle [Q3W]; IV carboplatin, 6 mg/mL/min Calvert formula area under the curve, Q3W; and IV paclitaxel, 200 mg/m^2^, Q3W) or Control arm (*N* = 31; bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel as above). Carboplatin/paclitaxel was discontinued after 4-6 cycles and patients who responded or remained stable received maintenance therapy with BTH1677/bevacizumab (BTH1677 arm) or bevacizumab (Control arm). ## Results ORR was higher in the BTH1677 vs Control arm but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (60.4% vs 43.5%; *P* = .2096). All other clinical endpoints also favored the BTH1677 arm but none statistically differed between arms. Although a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in the BTH1677 vs Control arm (93.2% vs 66.7%), no unexpected AEs were observed. Serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were lower in the BTH1677 vs Control arm. ## Conclusions Improvements in tumor assessments and survival were observed with BTH1677/bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel compared with control treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC. ## Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov registration ID: [ NCT00874107](#). Registered 2 April 2009. 1st participant was enrolled on 29 September 2009. # Results ## Patient disposition Between 29 September 2009 and 08 March 2013, a total of 92 patients with NSCLC were randomly assigned 2:1 to the BTH1677 or the Control arm. [1](#), 59 patients in the BTH1677 arm and 30 patients in the Control arm were treated and included in the safety and survival analyses. The blinded central radiology review primary efficacy population included 50 patients (48 patients response evaluable) in the BTH1677 arm and 23 patients in the Control arm. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation in each arm was disease progression (BTH1677, 45.9%; Control, 41.9%). Patient demographics and disease characteristics at baseline are shown in Table [1](#). The BTH1677 and Control arms were similar with respect to age, sex, race, as well as time from initial tumor diagnosis to diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to randomization. The percentage of patients with ECOG PS status of 1 vs 0 was higher in the BTH1677 arm (47.5%) than in the Control arm (33.3%). The percentage of patients who received prior cancer treatments (radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal, or other) was also higher in the BTH1677 arm compared with the Control arm.table wrap\n",

      "of patients For AEs of any grade that occurred in ≥10% of patients, those that were Grade 3 or Grade 4 are also presented in Table [5](#). For purposes of comparison here, Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs that occurred in ≥5% of patients in either treatment arm included neutropenia (39.0% BTH1677 vs 26.7% Control), thrombocytopenia (18.6% BTH1677 vs 16.7% Control), leukopenia (5.1% BTH1677 vs 3.3% Control), nausea (8.5% BTH1677 vs 0% Control), hemoglobin decreased (1.7% BTH1677 vs 6.7% Control), polyneuropathy (5.1% BTH1677 vs 0% Control), dyspnea (5.1% BTH1677 vs 0% Control), and hypertension (5.1% BTH1677 vs 3.3% Control). 8 deaths (7 in the BTH1677 arm; 1 in the Control arm) were reported in the treatment phase of within 30 days of the last dose of study medication. 6 of the 7 deaths in the BTH1677 arm were due to disease progression or complications of disease progression (e.g., pneumonia due to lung cancer, pneumothorax); the other death was due to intracranial hemorrhage that occurred subsequent to administration of anticoagulant for a blood clot in the lung. The 1 death in the Control arm was due to complications of disease progression (pneumonia due to lung cancer). ## BTH1677 pharmacokinetics BTH1677 serum concentrations in both cycles were above the limit of quantitation (4.7 ng/mL) for all but 1 patient. Mean serum trough levels of BTH1677 appeared to plateau as of Day 15 of Cycle 1, suggesting that steady state was achieved as of Day 15. Table [6](#) summarizes the PK parameters of BTH1677 from Cycle 1/Day 1 (*n* = 53) and Cycle 3/Day 1 ( *n* = 42). Geometric mean C~max~ of serum BTH1677 was similar in Cycle 1 (49.77 μg/mL) and Cycle 3 (60.50 μg/mL). AUC~0-24~ of BTH1677 was also similar in Cycle 1 (399.8 μg•hr./mL) and Cycle 3 (464.4 μg•hr./mL), with little to no accumulation of BTH1677 being observed. No notable difference in other PK parameters (CL, t ~max~, and V~ss~) between Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 were observed. A longer elimination1/2 life (t~1/2~) was observed in Cycle 1 (17.56 h) than Cycle 3 (7.17 h); however, these results should be interpreted with caution given the difference in sampling periods between Cycle 1 (up to 168 h post dosing) and Cycle 3 (only up to 24 h post dosing).table wrap\n",

      "# Abstract ## Background The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing doxycycline to suppress matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). ## Methods **Ex vivo treatment of AVM tissues:** Intact AVM tissues were treated with doxycycline for 48 hours. Active and total MMP-9 in the medium were measured. **Pilot trial:** AVM patients received either doxycycline (100 mg) or placebo twice 1 day for 1 week prior to AVM resection. Active and total MMP-9 in BVM tissues were measured. ## Results **Ex vivo treatment of AVM tissues:** Doxycycline at 10 and 100 μg/ml significantly decreased MMP-9 levels in AVM tissues ex vivo (total: control vs 10 vs 100 μg/ml = 100 ± 6 vs 60 ± 16 vs 61 ± 9%; active: 100 ± 8 vs 48 ± 16 vs 59 ± 10%). **Pilot trial:** 10 patients received doxycycline, and 4 patients received placebo. There was a trend for both MMP-9 levels to be lower in the doxycycline group than in the placebo group (total: 2.18 ± 1.94 vs 3.26 ± 3.58, P = .50; active: 0.48 ± 0.48 vs 0.95 ± 1.01 ng1/100 μg protein, P = .25). ## Conclusions A clinically relevant concentration of doxycycline decreased MMP-9 in ex vivo AVM tissues. Furthermore, there was a trend that oral doxycycline for as short as 1 week resulted in a decrease in MMP-9 in AVM tissues. Further studies are warranted to justify a clinical trial to test effects of doxycycline on MMP-9 expression in AVM tissues. # Ex vivo treatment of cultured AVM tissues We collected 2 AVM tissues for ex vivo treatment with doxycycline. # AVM I AVM tissue I was collected from a 28 y.o. patient with a 29 mm AVM (Spetzler Martin score 3). The patient had an AVM hemorrhage 236 days prior to the AVM resection. AVM tissue I was divided into 9 wells and treated with 0, 10, and 100 ng/ml of doxycycline (3 wells for each). 2 doxycycline doses were selected to test (1) whether an average doxycycline concentration (10 ng/ml) achieved by standard clinical treatment has any effects on MMP-9 in AVM tissue, and (2) whether a high concentration of doxycycline (100 ng/ml) has any effects of viability of AVM tissues in vitro. There was a gradual increase in LDH release over the course of 8 days, indicating continuous cellular death and a gradual decrease in tissue viability (Figure [1](#)). To avoid effects from ongoing cellular death and to ensure tissue viability during the treatment, we chose the 1st 48 hours to assess the effects of doxycycline on MMP-9 levels in AVM tissues. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Tissue viability assessed by LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) release.</strong> There was a gradual increase in LDH release (mean ± SD) over the course of 8 days, indicating continuous cellular death and a gradual decrease in tissue viability. However, there was no difference among different treatment groups.</figcaption> </figure> Tissue integrity was further assessed by examining H&E staining of ex vivo cultured tissues (Figure [2](#)). On day 0 (before the treatment), although cutting and mincing of the AVM tissues had caused minor tissue injury and distortion, a majority of blood vessels were intact and viable. On day 2 (after 48 hours of treatment), blood vessels were still intact and viable, and there was no apparent necrosis or hyalinization of the tissues. However, on day 7, a major part of the tissues, especially tissues surrounding blood vessels were anuclear and hyalinized, indicating that tissues were not intact or viable anymore. <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>H&amp;E staining of ex vivo cultured AVM tissues.</strong> On day 0 (before the treatment), although cutting and mincing of the AVM tissues appeared to cause minor tissue injury and distortion, a majority of blood vessels was intact and viable.

In addition, there was a significant reduction of total MMP-9 by doxycycline at 10 and 100 μg/ml (control vs doxycycline 10 μg/ml: 100 ± 6 vs 60 ± 16% control, P < .05; control vs doxycycline 100 μg/ml: 100 ± 6 vs 61 ± 9% control, P < .05). (Figure [4B](#)) There was no difference in active MMP-9 and total MMP-9 between doxycycline at 10 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml. A representative zymogram is shown in Figure [3](#). <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Representative zymogram showing MMP-9 and MMP-2 standard, control AVM tissues, AVM tissues treated with 10 μg/ml doxycycline, and AVM tissues treated with 100 μg/ml doxycycline.</strong> In AVM tissues, there were proteolytic bands corresponding to pro MMP-9 (≈97 kDa) and active MMP-9 (≈88 kDa).</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <p><img src=\"\" /></p> <figcaption><strong>Active and total MMP-9 levels after 48 hours of ex vivo doxycycline treatment.</strong> <strong>AVM I:</strong> Doxycycline 10 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml significantly decreased active MMP-9 There was a significant reduction of total MMP-9 by doxycycline at 10 and 100 μg/ml There was no difference in active MMP-9 and total MMP-9 between doxycycline at 10 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml. <strong>AVM II:</strong> Doxycycline 10 μg/ml significantly decreased active and total MMP-9. There was a trend for doxycycline 1 and 5 μg/ml to decrease active and total MMP-9. (mean ± SD)</figcaption> </figure> # AVM II AVM tissue II was collected from a 63 y.o. patient with a 22 mm AVM (Spetzler Martin score 2). The patients had a history of AVM hemorrhage 167 days prior to the AVM resection. The patient received an embolization treatment 1 day before the AVM resection. Using this tissue, we aimed to study effects of doxycycline at more clinically relevant concentrations of doxycycline (1--10 μg/ml). Therefore, AVM tissue II was treated with 0, 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml of doxycycline for 48 hours. Since the results from AVM tissue I showed a relatively wide variation in MMP-9 levels in each well among the same treatment group, we increased wells per treatment group from 3 to 4. There was no difference in tissue viability indicated by LDH release among different treatment groups at 48 hours (data not shown). Similar to the AVM I, doxycycline 10 μg/ml significantly decreased active and total MMP-9 (active MMP-9: control vs doxycycline 10 μg/ml: 100 ± 54 vs 43 ± 15% control, P < .05; total MMP-9: control vs doxycycline 10 μg/ml: 100 ± 41 vs 59 ± 21% control, P < .05) (Figure [ 4C](#) &[4D](#)). In addition, there was a trend for doxycycline 1 and 5 μg/ml to decrease active and total MMP-9. # Pilot clinical trial 14 AVM patients were enrolled. The trial was originally started as a double blinded randomized trial, and 9 patients were randomized. 10 patients received doxycycline, and 4 patients received placebo. Clinical data are shown in Table [1](#). To monitor compliance and possible side effects, study subjects were interviewed by phone 3 times during 1 week treatment period. 1 patient had nausea that was relieved by taking food with the drug.table wrap\n",

      "Bispectral index is 1 measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. ## METHODS: In a clinical trial, 90 patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into 3 groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O ~2~ ) and N ~2~ O and continued until target BIS (60 ± 2, 50 ± 2 and 40 ± 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among 3 groups. ## CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required. # Results 90 patients including 25 females and 65 males were enrolled into the study. Mean and standard deviation of age and weight were 2.82±1.25 years and 12.13±2.86 kg, respectively (P>0.05). The mean and SD of age in groups 1 to 3 were 2.77±1.4, 2.53±1.4 and 3.18±0.8, respectively with the p value of 0.122; and these measures for weight were 12.33±2.6, 11.87±3.4 and 12.18±2.6, respectively and the p value for this variable was 0.823. The relative distribution of male/female ration in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 21/9, 22/10.75, respectively (P = 0.946). There were no significant differences in laryngoscopy duration, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement, awakening time among 3 groups.
