A ""statistically significant"" P-value is considered typically less than 0.05 for studies that used a P-value to assess the hypothesis (such as the independent t-test). This cutoff of 0.05 is commonly accepted in scientific studies and is a frequent criterion for conducting a research test and judging

To the best of my understanding, the objective is to create a yaml file containing the design, type and direction of the intervention, and the results of the corresponding statistical tests. The yaml file should be created by drawing information from both the abstract and the manuscript body of the article. For example, the study type is a pilot RCT.

Given that the data was collected in a different format in the article, we first need to reconstruct the data into the requested table format. We found that there are indeed two groups with 9 participants each, and the intervention is compared with the non-intervention group. We can therefore follow the format of the first two tables provided in the article
