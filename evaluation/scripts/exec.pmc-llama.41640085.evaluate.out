### Input:
### Article: <abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>New graduates report intense stress during the transition from school to their first work settings. Managing this transition is important to reduce turnover rates. This study compared the effects of an externship program and a corporate-academic cooperation program on enhancing junior college students’ nursing competence and retention rates in the first 3 months and 1 year of initial employment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This two-phase study adopted a pretest and posttest quasi-experimental design. All participants were graduating students drawn from a 5-year junior nursing college in Taiwan. There were 19 and 24 students who participated in the phase I externship program and phase II corporate-academic cooperation program, respectively. The nursing competence of the students had to be evaluated by mentors within 48 hours of practicum training and after practicum training. The retention rate was also surveyed at 3 months and 1 year after beginning employment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Students who participated in the corporate-academic cooperation program achieved a statistically significant improvement in nursing competence and retention rates relative to those who participated in the externship program (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The corporate-academic cooperation program facilitates the transition of junior college nursing students into independent staff nurses, enhances their nursing competence, and boosts retention rates.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Baseline characteristics of hospitals and mentors</title><p>In the EP and CACP groups, 19 and 24 students were enrolled and 19 and 23 students completed the programs, respectively. At baseline, the hospital characteristics and demographics of the mentors in the 2 groups were examined by chi-squared analysis and independent t-tests to ensure homogeneity. Table 1 shows that there were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the 2 groups. However, 39.5% and 60.5% of the graduating students were placed at the medical center and regional teaching hospitals for the practicum, respectively. Most students were trained in medical wards (51.2%). Forty-three RNs participated in this program as mentors and were characterized as follows: mean age of 28.86 years (SD= 2.51), most were college-educated (33, 76.8%) and single (29, 67.5%), and the average number of working years as a nurse and average tenure in the present ward were 6.28 and 5.47 years, respectively.</p>

### Input:
### Article: <sec><title>Group comparison in nursing competence following practicum training</title><p>At T1, all students in both groups showed improvement in their total nursing competence scores, with mean scores of 117.63 (SD=19.01) and 158.52 (SD=23.19), respectively. Most mentors agreed that students had achieved the "can do much" level for the nursing competence questionnaire. Table 2 shows that the CACP group achieved higher scores than the EP group following practicum training (T1) across all 6 subscales. For further comparisons, we used the baseline levels of the 6 nursing competence subscales as covariates for control the baseline variation of 2 groups. The MANCOVA test revealed a significant difference in the mean scores of the EP and CACP groups across the 6 subscales at T1 (Wilks' lambda: F = 4.000, d.f. = 6, p = 0.005), and a comparison of the mean scores for every subscale at T1 revealed significant differences between the 2 groups: CC (p = 0.005), T/C (p = 0.000), P/E (p = 0.000), IPR/C (p = 0.000), PD (p = 0.002) and leadership (p = 0.000). Furthermore, based on pairwise MANCOVA comparisons with the baseline levels of the 6 nursing competence subscales applied as covariates, the mean difference of CACP and EP groups at T1 (e.g., differences in total nursing competence scores, including all 6 subscale scores in these 2 groups at T1) also showed significant differences (Table 2, the last column), and the power of the study to detect the multivariate effect of 2 trial groups was 0.933. Besides, we also noted that group discrepancy was apparent in the “top 3” ranking in terms of percentage of change (i.e., the mean difference of T1-T0 divided by the total subscale score) across the 6 subscales. In the EP group, the T/C, P/E and CC subscales showed the highest improvement; however, the “top 3” rankings in the CACP group were the P/E, IPR/C and CC subscales.</p></sec><sec><title>Group comparison of retention rate</title><p>The retention rate declined over time in both groups. After practicum training, 19 students (100%) remained in the EP group and 23 (95.8%) remained in the CACP group, and most of the students were engaged in a clinical job.

The reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaires and measures was approved using test-retest method and Cronbach’s alpha test, respectively.

Comparing the intervention and control groups within 4 months, variables such as intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, perception of autonomy, perception of competence and perception of relatedness, enjoyment motive, and health care climate, indicated moderate to high effect sizes.

### Article: <abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Physical activity (PA) prevents chronic diseases. Self-determination theory (SDT) provides a useful framework to understand the nature of motivational interviewing (MI).</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>This study aimed to determine the effect of MI-based intervention using SDT on the promotion of PA among women in reproductive age.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Seventy women in reproductive age were selected by clustering sampling method for this randomized controlled trial. The questionnaire included the variables of physical fitness test, SDT, and global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ). The validity of the questionnaires was approved using content validity ratio (CVR) and index (CVI). The reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaires and measures was approved using test-retest method and Cronbach’s alpha test, respectively. The intervention group (n=35) received four MI sessions through theory and one standard education session about PA. The control group (n=35) received a standard education session about PA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four months after the intervention, an increase in the mean scores of total PA (p&lt;0.001, ES=4.77), physical fitness tests including flexibility (p&lt;0.001, ES=1.59), muscular endurance (p&lt;0.001, ES=2.0), cardiorespiratory endurance (p&lt;0.001, ES=0.51), and a decrease in mean scores of agility test (p&lt;0.001, ES= − 0.51) and sedentary behavior (p&lt;0.01, ES=− 0.74) was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of intrinsic motivation (p&lt;0.001, ES=3.34), identified regulation (p&lt;0.001, ES= 1.28), perceptions of competence (p&lt;0.001, ES=0.81) and autonomy (p&lt;0.001, ES=2.01), enjoyment (p&lt;0.001, ES=0.98) and health motives (p&lt;0.01, ES=0.19), health care climate (p&lt;0.001, ES=4.6), and a decreased score of external regulation (p&lt;0.01, ES=−0.55) and amotivation (p&lt;0.01, ES= −0.56) over time, compared to the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MI-based intervention using SDT was effective on the promotion of PA.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The Trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial (<ext-link>http://www.irct.ir</ext-link>) with the Irct ID: IRCT2015101924592N1.</p></sec></abstract><sec><title>3.

SDT components</title><p>The results of the psychological variables of SDT are shown in Table 2. With repeated measures test, the intervention group showed a higher level of autonomy, identified regulation, perception of competence, challenge and enjoyment motives through time than before the intervention. Friedman’s non-parametric test also showed an increased intrinsic motivation, introjected regulation, perception of self-determination and fitness/health motive and a reduction in amotivation in the intervention group compared to before intervention over time (Table 2). Comparing the intervention and control groups within 4 months, variables such as intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, perception of autonomy, perception of competence and perception of relatedness, enjoyment motive, and health care climate, indicated moderate to high effect sizes. Conversely, introjected regulation, external regulation, amotivation and fitness/health, challenge, social and appearance motives, showed low or negative effect sizes (Table 3).</p></sec><sec><title>3.2. Physical activity and sedentary behavior</title><p>With repeated measures tests, the participants in the intervention group showed a higher level of PA over time and a lower level of sedentary behavior in the non-parametric Friedman test compared to pre-intervention time (Table 2). Within 4 months after intervention, the subjects in the intervention group showed higher level of PA with high effect size and lower level of sedentary behavior with negative effect size compared with the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>3.3. Body composition and physical fitness tests</title><p>In the intervention group, the repeated measures tests showed a significant reduction in body mass index, and paired t-test showed a significant increase in body flexibility, muscle endurance, and cardiorespiratory endurance and a significant reduction in agility score over time (Table 2). The subjects in the intervention group indicated lower scores of body mass index and agility, with a negative effect size and higher levels of cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular endurance and flexibility of the body with medium to high effect sizes, in 4 months after intervention compared with the control group (Table 4).</p></sec></sec>

### Input:
### Article: <abstract><p>In order to assess the effects of juice feedings during acute diarrhea a double-blind, randomized study was performed in 90 children, mean age of 10 ± 4.28 months. Thirty patients with acute diarrhea were fed twice-daily 15 ml/kg of Apple Juice (AJ), 30 received White Grape Juice (WGJ), and 30 were given colored and flavored water (WA) as part of their age appropriate dietary intake. The duration and severity of diarrhea were the main endpoint variables of the study performed in a metabolic unit. The patients were similar among the 3 groups, had diarrhea for 50–64 hours prior to admission, and were dehydrated when admitted to the unit for study. Half of the patients in each group were well nourished and the others had mild to moderate degrees of malnutrition. Rotavirus infection was the agent causing the illness in 63% of the patients. The infants fed juice ingested 14–17% more calories than those given WA, (those receiving AJ and WGJ ingested 95 and 98 Calories/Kg/d respectively) whereas those receiving WA consumed 81 cal/kg/d). The increased energy intake was not at the expense of other foods or milk formula. The mean body weight gain was greater among patients receiving WGJ (+ 50.7 gm) as compared with the patients in the AJ group (+ 18.3 gm) or the patients fed WA (- 0.7 gm) (p = 0.08). The duration of the illness was longer in the infants fed juice as compared with those given WA (p = 0.006), the mean +/- SD duration in hours was 49.4 ± 32.6, 47.5 ± 38.9 and 26.5 ± 27.4 in patients fed AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. All patients improved while ingesting juice and none of them developed persistent diarrhea; most recovered within 50 hours of the beginning of treatment and less than one fourth had diarrhea longer than 96 hours in the unit. The fecal losses were also increased among the juice fed patients (p = 0.001); the mean ± SD fecal excretion in g/kg/h was 3.94 ± 2.35, 3.59 ± 2.35, and 2.19 ± 1.63 in AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. The stool output was highest during the first day of treatment among all the patients, though those fed AJ had the highest volume of fecal losses and those who received WA had the lowest stool excretion. After the first day of treatment the differences in fecal excretion were not significant. The ability to tolerate carbohydrates during the illness and immediately after recovery was similar among the 3 groups of patients. Intake of juices with different fructose/glucose ratios and osmolarities resulted in more fecal losses and more prolonged diarrhea as compared with water feedings, but the patients given juice ingested more calories and gained more weight, particularly among those being fed the juice with equimolar concentrations of fructose and glucose.</p></abstract><title>Results</title><p>The clinical characteristics and the laboratory data of the patients on admission are shown in tables 2 and 3. The patients in each of the 3 groups were similar in age, duration and severity of diarrhea, presence of fever and vomiting. Also there were no differences in the proportion of patients who received breast feedings or in their nutritional status. Over 46% of patients studied in each group, were well nourished, more than 33% showed mild body weight deficits (&lt;1 SD) and the others had mild to moderate malnutrition (&gt;2 SD). All patients presented some dehydration (mild to moderate), and required no intravenous hydration therapy. Differences in clinical characteristics were not significant among groups.</p>

### Input:
### Article: <abstract><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The preventive impact of hospital-acquired infection (HAI) surveillance is difficult to assess. Our objective was to investigate the effect of HAI surveillance disruption on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A quasi-experimental study with an intervention group and a control group was conducted between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2010 in two intensive care units (ICUs) of a university hospital that participated in a national HAI surveillance network. Surveillance was interrupted during the year 2007 in unit A (intervention group) and was continuous in unit B (control group). Period 1 (pre-test period) comprised patients hospitalized during 2004 to 2006, and period 2 (post-test period) involved patients hospitalized during 2008 to 2010. Patients hospitalized ≥48 hours and intubated during their stay were included. Multivariate Poisson regression was fitted to ascertain the influence of surveillance disruption.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2,771 patients, accounting for 19,848 intubation-days at risk, were studied; 307 had VAP. The VAP attack rate increased in unit A from 7.8% during period 1 to 17.1% during period 2 (P &lt;0.001); in unit B, it was 7.2% and 11.2% for the two periods respectively (P = 0.17). Adjusted VAP incidence rose in unit A after surveillance disruption (incidence rate ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.47, P = 0.036), independently of VAP trend; no change was observed in unit B. All-cause mortality and length of stay increased (P = 0.028 and P = 0.038, respectively) in unit A between periods 1 and 2. In unit B, no change in mortality was observed (P = 0.22), while length of stay decreased between periods 1 and 2 (P = 0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>VAP incidence, length of stay and all-cause mortality rose after HAI surveillance disruption in ICU, which suggests a specific effect of HAI surveillance on VAP prevention and reinforces the role of data feedback and counselling as a mechanism to facilitate performance improvement.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Of the 4,411 patients included in the surveillance of both units during the study period, 2,915 (61.1%) were exposed to mechanical ventilation during their hospital stay. Data were missing for 4.9% (n = 144) of intubated patients and were, therefore, excluded.</p><p>Totally, 2,771 patients, accounting for 37,330 hospitalisation days, 26,768 intubation-days and 19,848 intubation-days at risk, were analysed. Among them, 940 (34%) were hospitalised in unit A, and 1,831 (66%) in unit B. Overall, 62% (n = 1,724) were men, and mean ± SD age was 60 ± 16 years. Totally, 61% (n = 1,694) received antibiotics at admission, 41% (n = 1,142) came from home, and 26% (n = 721) were immunosuppressed. Mean ± SD SAPSII score was 53 ± 20. All-cause in-hospital mortality was 26% (n = 712).</p><p>Overall, 307 patients had VAP. The VAP attack rate was 11.1 per 100 intubated patients and the VAP incidence rate was 15.5 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 13.8 to 17.3) per 1,000 intubation-days at risk.</p></sec><title>Characteristics by group and period</title><p>Table 1 reports the characteristics of hospitalised patients by group and period. In the intervention group with surveillance interrupted in 2007, patients hospitalised during period 2 compared to period 1 more often came from home (P = 0.004), were more immunosuppressed (P &lt;0.001), more often had surgery as diagnosis category (P &lt;0.001), received antibiotics less frequently at admission (P &lt;.001), were older (P = 0.022), and presented lower mean SAPSII (P &lt;0.001). In the control group with continuous surveillance, patients hospitalised during period 2 compared to period 1 were less likely to come from home (P &lt;0.001), were more immunosuppressed (P &lt;0.001), and received antibiotics more frequently at admission (P &lt;0.001).</p>

### Question: Based on the given trial article, what is the table of mean outcome and standard deviation in YAML format for the following Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome?
Intervention: Interrupted surveillance unit A
Comparator: Continuous surveillance, unit B
Outcome: mean ± SD length of hospital stay between periods 1 and 2 in patients who did not suffer from VAP

Include the total size of each group for Intervention and Comparator. 
The YAML format should include the fields "mean", "standard_deviation", and "group_size" for only "intervention" and "comparator" but not "outcome". Example:
intervention:
    mean: NUMBER
    standard_deviation: NUMBER
    group_size: NUMBER
comparator:
    mean: NUMBER
    standard_deviation: NUMBER
    group_size: NUMBER

Only produce YAML response. Do NOT provide an explanation. If any of the numerical information is unavailable or not extractable or not easy to calculate, please say "x".
If there are numerical data for pre and post-intervention, choose the post-intervention data. If there are multiple timeframes for the outcome, choose the one closest to the outcome timepoint of interest or the very last one.
### Response:
[ERROR] The size of tensor a (2048) must match the size of tensor b (2049) at non-singleton dimension 3
None
