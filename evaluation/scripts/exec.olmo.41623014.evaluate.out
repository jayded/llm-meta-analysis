input chunk token size: Article: <abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Little information is available about whether the use of self-assessment instruments in primary care affects depression course and outcome. The purpose was to evaluate whether using a depression self-rating scale in recurrent person-centred GP consultations affected depression severity, quality of life, medication use, and sick leave frequency.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients in the intervention group met their GP regularly at least 4 times during the 3 months intervention. In addition to treatment as usual (TAU), patients completed a self-assessment instrument (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) on each occasion, and then GPs used the completed instrument as the basis for a person-centred discussion of changes in depression symptoms. The control group received TAU. Frequency of visits in the TAU arm was the result of the GPs’ and patients’ joint assessments of care need in each case.</p><p>Depression severity was measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), quality of life with EQ-5D, and psychological well-being with the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Data on sick leave, antidepressant and sedatives use, and care contacts were collected from electronic patient records. All variables were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Mean intra-individual changes were compared between the intervention and TAU group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences between the intervention and control group in depression severity reduction or remission rate, change in quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative prescriptions, or sick leave during the whole 12-month follow-up. However, significantly more patients in the intervention group continued antidepressants until the 6 month follow-up (86/125 vs 78/133, p &lt; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When GPs used a depression self-rating scale in recurrent consultations, patients more often continued antidepressant medication according to guidelines, compared to TAU patients. However, reduction of depressive symptoms, remission rate, quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative use, sick leave, and health care use 4-12 months was not significantly different from the TAU group. These findings suggest that frequent use of depression rating scales in person-centred primary care consultations has no further additional effect on patients’ depression or well-being, sick leave, or health care use.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link>NCT01402206</ext-link>.

All patients who participated in the study, both those in the intervention and those in the TAU group, improved in all three variables between baseline and 3 months but there were no significant differences in mean changes (mean of intra-individual ∆) between the groups. Improvements were substantial in both groups; at the 3-month follow-up, nearly half the patients no longer had depression (BDI &lt;13) (49% in the intervention and 47.3% in the TAU group, p = 0.89). We also performed logistic regression analyses. The models showed that at the 12-month follow-up, older age was associated with improved BDI-II score (OR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.99), and a higher level of education was associated with improved EQ-5D score (OR 3.9, CI 1.77-8.73). The factors added to the model (sex, age, education, antidepressant medication, and participation in the intervention or TAU group) explained the same amount of variation in both the intervention and TAU groups. Thus, the difference between the groups remained non-significant (data not shown).

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Secondary efficacy endpoints included week 8 Clinical Global Impressions–Severity, Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement (CGI-I), and response (CGI-I ≤ 2). Safety assessments included adverse events, physical and vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.</p><p>Results: The safety population included 339 patients (children, n = 130; adolescents, n = 209). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, did not statistically separate from placebo, for either desvenlafaxine (adjusted mean [standard error] change, −22.6 [1.17]) or fluoxetine (−24.8 [1.17]; placebo, −23.1 [1.18]). Week 8 CGI-I response rates were significantly greater for fluoxetine (78.2%; p = 0.017) than for placebo (62.6%); desvenlafaxine (68.7%) did not differ from placebo.

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Secondary efficacy endpoints included week 8 Clinical Global Impressions–Severity, Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement (CGI-I), and response (CGI-I ≤ 2). Safety assessments included adverse events, physical and vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.</p><p>Results: The safety population included 339 patients (children, n = 130; adolescents, n = 209). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, did not statistically separate from placebo, for either desvenlafaxine (adjusted mean [standard error] change, −22.6 [1.17]) or fluoxetine (−24.8 [1.17]; placebo, −23.1 [1.18]). Week 8 CGI-I response rates were significantly greater for fluoxetine (78.2%; p = 0.017) than for placebo (62.6%); desvenlafaxine (68.7%) did not differ from placebo. Other secondary outcomes were consistent with those obtained with CDRS-R. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable among treatment groups (desvenlafaxine, 60.0%; placebo, 70.5%; and fluoxetine, 64.3%). </p><p>Conclusion: Desvenlafaxine did not demonstrate efficacy for treating MDD in children and adolescents in this trial. Because neither desvenlafaxine nor the reference medication, fluoxetine, demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo on the primary endpoint, this was considered a failed trial and no efficacy conclusions can be drawn. Desvenlafaxine 25–50 mg/d was generally safe and well tolerated in children and adolescents in this study.</p></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 340 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 339 patients (children, n = 130; adolescents, n = 209) were included in the safety population (desvenlafaxine, n = 115; fluoxetine, n = 112; placebo, n = 112). The ITT population included 130 children and 207 adolescents. A total of 42 (12%) patients discontinued early (desvenlafaxine, 16 [14%]; fluoxetine, 13 [12%]; and placebo, 13 [12%]). Lost to follow-up was the most common reason for discontinuation from the desvenlafaxine and placebo groups; in the fluoxetine group, the most common reason for discontinuation was “no longer willing to participate” (Fig. 1).</p><fig><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p>Study flow. aOne patient was screened and, although not randomized, received a total of eight blinded placebo doses.

Mean (SD) CDRS-R Total Score at baseline was 56.5 (8.9), mean (SD) CGI-S score was 4.5 (0.6), and the duration of the most recent depressive episode ranged from 1 to 96 months (median, 7; mean [SD], 13.4 [15.1]). Overall, 30.4% (103) of patients in the safety population had a prior or active psychiatric condition other than MDD in their medical history (desvenlafaxine, 31.3%; fluoxetine, 25.9%; and placebo, 33.9%). The most common psychiatric conditions (reported by ≥2% of patients) included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (desvenlafaxine, 12.2%; fluoxetine, 13.4%; and placebo, 5.4%), nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (desvenlafaxine, 7.0%; fluoxetine, 8.0%; and placebo, 12.5%), insomnia (desvenlafaxine, 7.0%; fluoxetine, 6.3%; and placebo, 8.0%), generalized anxiety disorder (desvenlafaxine, 0.9%; fluoxetine, 6.3%; and placebo, 0), and oppositional defiant disorder (desvenlafaxine, 3.5%; fluoxetine, 3.6%; and placebo, 0).</p>

The purpose was to evaluate whether using a depression self-rating scale in recurrent person-centred GP consultations affected depression severity, quality of life, medication use, and sick leave frequency.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients in the intervention group met their GP regularly at least 4 times during the 3 months intervention. In addition to treatment as usual (TAU), patients completed a self-assessment instrument (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) on each occasion, and then GPs used the completed instrument as the basis for a person-centred discussion of changes in depression symptoms. The control group received TAU. Frequency of visits in the TAU arm was the result of the GPs’ and patients’ joint assessments of care need in each case.</p><p>Depression severity was measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), quality of life with EQ-5D, and psychological well-being with the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Data on sick leave, antidepressant and sedatives use, and care contacts were collected from electronic patient records. All variables were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Mean intra-individual changes were compared between the intervention and TAU group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences between the intervention and control group in depression severity reduction or remission rate, change in quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative prescriptions, or sick leave during the whole 12-month follow-up. However, significantly more patients in the intervention group continued antidepressants until the 6 month follow-up (86/125 vs 78/133, p &lt; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When GPs used a depression self-rating scale in recurrent consultations, patients more often continued antidepressant medication according to guidelines, compared to TAU patients. However, reduction of depressive symptoms, remission rate, quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative use, sick leave, and health care use 4-12 months was not significantly different from the TAU group. These findings suggest that frequent use of depression rating scales in person-centred primary care consultations has no further additional effect on patients’ depression or well-being, sick leave, or health care use.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link>NCT01402206</ext-link>.

Improvements were substantial in both groups; at the 3-month follow-up, nearly half the patients no longer had depression (BDI &lt;13) (49% in the intervention and 47.3% in the TAU group, p = 0.89). We also performed logistic regression analyses. The models showed that at the 12-month follow-up, older age was associated with improved BDI-II score (OR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.99), and a higher level of education was associated with improved EQ-5D score (OR 3.9, CI 1.77-8.73). The factors added to the model (sex, age, education, antidepressant medication, and participation in the intervention or TAU group) explained the same amount of variation in both the intervention and TAU groups. Thus, the difference between the groups remained non-significant (data not shown). No adverse events were reported from intervention or TAU group.<fig><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Depression severity (BDI-II values) in the intervention and TAU groups.

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Secondary efficacy endpoints included week 8 Clinical Global Impressions–Severity, Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement (CGI-I), and response (CGI-I ≤ 2). Safety assessments included adverse events, physical and vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.</p><p>Results: The safety population included 339 patients (children, n = 130; adolescents, n = 209). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, did not statistically separate from placebo, for either desvenlafaxine (adjusted mean [standard error] change, −22.6 [1.17]) or fluoxetine (−24.8 [1.17]; placebo, −23.1 [1.18]). Week 8 CGI-I response rates were significantly greater for fluoxetine (78.2%; p = 0.017) than for placebo (62.6%); desvenlafaxine (68.7%) did not differ from placebo. Other secondary outcomes were consistent with those obtained with CDRS-R. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable among treatment groups (desvenlafaxine, 60.0%; placebo, 70.5%; and fluoxetine, 64.3%). </p><p>Conclusion: Desvenlafaxine did not demonstrate efficacy for treating MDD in children and adolescents in this trial. Because neither desvenlafaxine nor the reference medication, fluoxetine, demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo on the primary endpoint, this was considered a failed trial and no efficacy conclusions can be drawn. Desvenlafaxine 25–50 mg/d was generally safe and well tolerated in children and adolescents in this study.</p></abstract><title>Results</title><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 340 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 339 patients (children, n = 130; adolescents, n = 209) were included in the safety population (desvenlafaxine, n = 115; fluoxetine, n = 112; placebo, n = 112). The ITT population included 130 children and 207 adolescents. A total of 42 (12%) patients discontinued early (desvenlafaxine, 16 [14%]; fluoxetine, 13 [12%]; and placebo, 13 [12%]).

Both groups were similar in age and sex distribution. The most common symptom was severe flank pain, which was present in 69% of patients. History of urinary tract infection was detected in 47% and 51% reported associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Pyuria was seen in 58% and only 36% of patients had positive urine culture, with Escherichia coli (E. coli) as the most common pathogen (60%). The preoperative sonographic evaluation and IVP results are shown in Table 1. Intraoperative assessments showed ureteropelvic junction segmental atresia in 45 cases and aberrant vessels in 25 patients. The postoperative course was compared in two groups of patients, with and without internal drainage (Table 2). Among patients with extravasation in DTPA scan in the stent free group, retrograde DJ stent was inserted in four cases that had unacceptable drainage due to inflammation. One patient had distal ureter obstruction because of distal ureter stone, that was treated by Trans-ureteral lithotripsy (TULP) and stent support. Three other cases had no anatomical abnormality, and they were followed and extravasation resolved spontaneously at control IVP after one month. Removal of DJ stent was planned in one month after operation. However, eight cases missed the time and late stent removal was accompanied with several complications, such as stone formation on the tip of catheter in the bladder of a patient that needed TULP before stent removal.</p><table-wrap><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Results of Preoperative Ultrasonography and Intravenous Pyelography Evaluation a, b</title></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Imaging Method</th><th>Right Kidney</th><th>Left Kidney</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sonography</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Severe hydronephrosis</td><td>28 (34.6)</td><td>35 (43.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate hydronephrosis</td><td>8 (9.9)</td><td>9 (11.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Mild hydronephrosis</td><td>6 (7.4)</td><td>3 (3.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Without hydronephrosis</td><td>39 (48)</td><td>34 (42)</td></tr><tr><td>IVP</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No secretion</td><td>6 (7.3)</td><td>9 (11)</td></tr><tr><td>Delayed secretion</td><td>33 (40.2)</td><td>38 (46.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Normal secretion</td><td>43 (52.4)</td><td>35 (42.7)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>aAbbreviation: IVP, intravenous pyelography</p></fn><fn><p>bData are presented as No. (%).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparing Postoperative Course Between Patients who Underwent Pyeloplasty With or Without Internal Drainage a, b</title></caption><table><thead><tr><th>Post-Operative Course</th><th>With Stent (n = 30)</th><th>Without Stent (n = 52)</th><th>P Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Drain removal</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>In 48 hours</td><td>12 (40)</td><td>17 (32.7)</td><td>0.583</td></tr><tr><td>After 2 days</td><td>18 (60)</td><td>34 (65.4)</td><td>0.632</td></tr><tr><td>Mean hospital stay, d</td><td>36 ± 1.74</td><td>3.4 ± 1.30</td><td>0.841</td></tr><tr><td>Urine analysis c</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hematuria</td><td>19/27</td><td>32/32</td><td>0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Pyuria</td><td>12/27</td><td>20/32</td><td>0.008</td></tr><tr><td>Post-operative IVP (one month later)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Extravasation</td><td>2 (6.7)</td><td>8 (15.3)</td><td>0.209</td></tr><tr><td>Delayed secretion</td><td>19 (63.3)</td><td>25 (48.1)</td><td>0.124</td></tr><tr><td>Visible ureter</td><td>18 (60)</td><td>41 (78.8)</td><td>0.633</td></tr><tr><td>DTPA scand</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Partial obstruction</td><td>8/20</td><td>13/44</td><td>0.716</td></tr><tr><td>Urinary symptoms </td><td>24 (80)</td><td>2 (3.8)</td><td>0.005</td></tr><tr><td>Urinoma</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (1.9)</td><td>0.324</td></tr><tr><td>Recurrence of stenosis</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>reoperation</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (1.9)</td><td>0.324</td></tr><tr><td>Stent remnants</td><td>2 (6.7)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0.041</td></tr><tr><td>Flank pain at voiding</td><td>10 (33.3)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0.001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>aAbbreviations: IVP, intravenous pyelography; DTPA, diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate.</p></fn><fn><p>bData are presented as No. (%).</p></fn><fn><p>cUrine analysis was done in 27 patients of the stent group and 32 cases of the stent free group.</p></fn><fn><p>dDTPA scan was done in 20 patients of stent group and 32 cases of stent free group.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec>

The purpose was to evaluate whether using a depression self-rating scale in recurrent person-centred GP consultations affected depression severity, quality of life, medication use, and sick leave frequency.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients in the intervention group met their GP regularly at least 4 times during the 3 months intervention. In addition to treatment as usual (TAU), patients completed a self-assessment instrument (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) on each occasion, and then GPs used the completed instrument as the basis for a person-centred discussion of changes in depression symptoms. The control group received TAU. Frequency of visits in the TAU arm was the result of the GPs’ and patients’ joint assessments of care need in each case.</p><p>Depression severity was measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), quality of life with EQ-5D, and psychological well-being with the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Data on sick leave, antidepressant and sedatives use, and care contacts were collected from electronic patient records. All variables were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Mean intra-individual changes were compared between the intervention and TAU group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences between the intervention and control group in depression severity reduction or remission rate, change in quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative prescriptions, or sick leave during the whole 12-month follow-up. However, significantly more patients in the intervention group continued antidepressants until the 6 month follow-up (86/125 vs 78/133, p &lt; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When GPs used a depression self-rating scale in recurrent consultations, patients more often continued antidepressant medication according to guidelines, compared to TAU patients. However, reduction of depressive symptoms, remission rate, quality of life, psychological well-being, sedative use, sick leave, and health care use 4-12 months was not significantly different from the TAU group. These findings suggest that frequent use of depression rating scales in person-centred primary care consultations has no further additional effect on patients’ depression or well-being, sick leave, or health care use.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link>NCT01402206</ext-link>.

All patients who participated in the study, both those in the intervention and those in the TAU group, improved in all three variables between baseline and 3 months but there were no significant differences in mean changes (mean of intra-individual ∆) between the groups. Improvements were substantial in both groups; at the 3-month follow-up, nearly half the patients no longer had depression (BDI &lt;13) (49% in the intervention and 47.3% in the TAU group, p = 0.89). We also performed logistic regression analyses. The models showed that at the 12-month follow-up, older age was associated with improved BDI-II score (OR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.99), and a higher level of education was associated with improved EQ-5D score (OR 3.9, CI 1.77-8.73). The factors added to the model (sex, age, education, antidepressant medication, and participation in the intervention or TAU group) explained the same amount of variation in both the intervention and TAU groups. Thus, the difference between the groups remained non-significant (data not shown).

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Secondary efficacy endpoints included week 8 Clinical Global Impressions–Severity, Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement (CGI-I), and response (CGI-I ≤ 2). Safety assessments included adverse events, physical and vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.</p><p>Results: The safety population included 339 patients (children, n = 130; adolescents, n = 209). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, did not statistically separate from placebo, for either desvenlafaxine (adjusted mean [standard error] change, −22.6 [1.17]) or fluoxetine (−24.8 [1.17]; placebo, −23.1 [1.18]). Week 8 CGI-I response rates were significantly greater for fluoxetine (78.2%; p = 0.017) than for placebo (62.6%); desvenlafaxine (68.7%) did not differ from placebo.

Based on the given trial article, what is the 2x2 contingency table in YAML format for the following Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome?
Intervention: fluoxetine
Comparator: placebo
Outcome: CGI-I response rate

The YAML format should include the fields "events" and "group_size" for only "intervention" and "comparator" but not "outcome". Example:
intervention:
    events: NUMBER
    group_size: NUMBER	
comparator:
    events: NUMBER
    group_size: NUMBER

Only produce YAML response. Do NOT provide explanation. If any of the numerical information is unavailable or not extractable or not easy to calculate, please say "x". 
If there are numerical data for pre and post-intervention, choose the post-intervention data. If there are multiple timeframes for the outcome, choose the one closest to the outcome timepoint of interest or the very last one.

input chunk token size: Article: <abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Limited information has been published regarding how specific processes for event adjudication can affect event rates in trials. We reviewed nonfatal myocardial infarctions (MIs) reported by site investigators in the international Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin (Eptifibatide) Therapy (PURSUIT) trial and those adjudicated by a central clinical events committee (CEC) to determine the reasons for differences in event rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The PURSUIT trial randomised 10,948 patients with acute coronary syndromes to receive eptifibatide or placebo. The primary end-point was death or post-enrolment MI at 30 days as assessed by the CEC; this end-point was also constructed using site-reported events. The CEC identified suspected MIs by systematic review of clinical, cardiac enzyme, and electrocardiographic data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The CEC identified 5005 (46%) suspected events, of which 1415 (28%) were adjudicated as MI. The site investigator and CEC assessments of whether a MI had occurred disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients with suspected MI, mostly reflecting site misclassification of post-enrolment MIs (as enrolment MIs) or underreported periprocedural MIs. Patients for whom the CEC and site investigator agreed that no end-point MI had occurred had the lowest mortality at 30 days and between 30 days and 6 months, and those with agreement that a MI had occurred had the highest mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CEC adjudication provides a standard, systematic, independent, and unbiased assessment of end-points, particularly for trials that span geographic regions and clinical practice settings. Understanding the review process and reasons for disagreement between CEC and site investigator assessments of MI is important to design future trials and interpret event rates between trials.</p></sec></abstract><title>Results</title><sec><title>Incidence of disagreement</title><p>Overall, 5005 (46%) patients with possible or suspected MI were identified and adjudicated by the CEC. The CEC identified more patients with end-point events than did the site investigators (13.6% versus 7.7% for placebo, 12.6% versus 6.2% for eptifibatide). The CEC and site investigator assessments of MI disagreed for 9% of all patients enrolled in the PURSUIT trial. The CEC identified MIs in 1415 of the 5005 patients with suspected MI. The site investigator and the CEC assessments disagreed in 983 (20%) of the 5005 patients. Of these 983 patients with disagreements, 816 patients had a MI identified by the CEC but not the site investigator, and 167 patients had a MI identified by site investigator but not the CEC. The proportion of patients with disagreement was similar among regions.</p></sec><title>Reasons for disagreement</title><p>Most often, when the site investigator had identified a MI and the CEC had not, the investigator had misclassified a MI at enrolment as an end-point MI, although by protocol these were not end-point events (Table 1). Recurrent ischemic events without elevated cardiac enzymes or ECG evidence of MI were also incorrectly identified by site investigators as MIs (Table 1). In cases where the CEC had identified a MI and the site investigators had not, one-third of those identified were MIs defined by enzyme elevations without clinical or ECG evidence of ischemia or infarction (Table 2). Enzyme elevations after bypass surgery accounted for 25% of these cases. Patients with clinically evident ischemia reported by the site investigator and associated with cardiac enzyme elevations were not reported as MIs by investigators in 27% of the cases of disagreement (Table 2). Few infarctions based on new Q waves without clinical evidence of reinfarction were identified by the CEC and not by site investigators.</p><table-wrap><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Myocardial infarctions identified by site investigators but not confirmed by the clinical events committee</p></caption><table><thead><tr><td></td><td>Eastern Europe</td><td>Latin America</td><td>North America</td><td>Western Europe</td><td>Overall</td></tr><tr><td>Clinical scenario</td><td>(n = 24)</td><td>(n = 8)</td><td>(n = 57)</td><td>(n = 78)</td><td>(n = 167)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Enrolment myocardial infarction*</td><td>8 (33)</td><td>4 (50)</td><td>24 (42)</td><td>28 (36)</td><td>64 (38)</td></tr><tr><td>Ischemic event without infarction†</td><td>7 (29)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>8 (14)</td><td>19 (24)</td><td>34 (20)</td></tr><tr><td>Peri-death infarction‡</td><td>6 (25)</td><td>2 (25)</td><td>13 (23)</td><td>8 (10)</td><td>29 (17)</td></tr><tr><td>Percutaneous coronary intervention related</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (12.5)</td><td>6 (11)</td><td>10 (13)</td><td>17 (10)</td></tr><tr><td>Coronary artery bypass surgery related</td><td>2 (8)</td><td>1 (12.5)</td><td>5 (9)</td><td>7 (9)</td><td>15 (9)</td></tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous</td><td>1 (4)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>6 (8)</td><td>8 (5)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data presented as n (%). * Not an end-point event per protocol. † Clinical evidence of ischemia without electrocardiography (ECG) or cardiac enzyme evidence of infarction. ‡ Infarction suspected at the time of death without supporting clinical, ECG, or cardiac enzyme data.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
